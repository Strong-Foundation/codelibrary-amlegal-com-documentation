EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or
occurs.

tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due

tax due at regular due date, and following the filing of a return, owes to the

      (1)   All taxes imposed by this section and remaining unpaid after they
become due shall bear interest, in addition to the amount of the unpaid tax, at
the rate of 0.25% per month until paid in full.
      (2)   In addition to the interest provided in Section
191.05(c)(1), failure to file by extension deadline (November 1) will be
charged a penalty of $25.00 or 10% of tax due, whichever is greater.
         (Ord. 62-11. Passed 12-27-11; Ord. 62-12. Passed 12-17-12.)

thereof, pay to the administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereof,

191.07 to another municipality the taxpayer may claim credit of these taxes
limited to the amount paid to another municipality but in no event shall said
credit be no more than tax rate of 1%, which represents 50% of Coshocton’s City
tax rate. All City residents must complete and file a tax return regardless of
whether any tax is due.
(Ord. 21-15. Passed 7-13-15.)
   (e)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have the overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, the overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded; however, no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (f)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements or limitations contained in Section
191.11 and Section
191.15. The amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Income Tax Director. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax liability
affecting the taxpayer’s tax liability to the City, the taxpayer shall make and
file an amended return showing income subject to the income tax of the City
based upon the final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereof or make a claim for the refund of any
overpayment.
(Ord. 62-04. Passed 11-22-04.)
   (g)   Taxpayers filing after April 15 without an extension will be charged a
late file fee of $25.00.
(Ord. 62-12. Passed 12-17-12.)
191.06 COLLECTION AT THE SOURCE.

Director, each employer within or doing business within this City shall deduct
at the time of the payment of the salary, wage, commission, or other

   (a)   It shall be the duty of the Income Tax Director to receive the tax
imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from the taxpayers; to
keep an accurate record thereof; and to report all moneys so received. It shall
be the duty of the Income Tax Director to enforce payment of all taxes owed to
the City; to accurate records for a minimum of five years showing the amount
due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration or make a return,
including taxes withheld; and to show the dates and amounts of payments
thereof.

chapter and is authorized to adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the collection of taxes and
the administration and enforcement of this chapter, including provisions for
the re-examination and the correction of returns. The Income Tax Director is
authorized to arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties
on a schedule of installment payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the
Income Tax Director that due to certain hardship conditions he is unable to pay
the full amount of the tax due. The authorization shall not be granted until
proper returns are filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this
chapter. Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total
unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and
the provisions of Sections
191.11 and
191.12 shall apply.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Income Tax
Director may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from the
taxpayer and shall send to the taxpayer a written statement showing the amount
of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties, if any.
   (d)   Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to a
regulation approved by the Board, the Income Tax Director shall have the power
to compromise any interest or penalty or both, imposed by Section
191.10.

authorized to examine the books, papers, records, and federal income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or person subject to, or whom the Income Tax
Director believes is subject to, this chapter for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due under this chapter. Every employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed
taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish, upon written request by
the Income Tax Director or his duty authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making these examinations and investigations

have knowledge of the facts to appear before him and may examine the person,
under oath, concerning any income which was or should have been reported for
taxation or any transactions tending to affect the income. For this purpose,
the Income Tax Director may compel the production of books, papers, records and
federal income tax returns; the refusal to submit to the examination by any
employer or person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Income Tax Director authorized hereby, shall be deemed
a violation of this chapter.
   (c)   Any information gained as the result of any return, investigation,
hearing, or verification required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, except for official purposes, or except in accordance with proper
judicial order. No person shall divulge this information.

         (Ord. 11-05. Passed 3-28-05.)
   (b)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional assessment made by
the Income Tax Director when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Income Tax Director. Further, in

additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, provided an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months after final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (c)   Upon the recommendation of the Income Tax Director, the Board of
Review may abate penalty, or interest, or both. Upon appeal from the refusal of
the Income Tax Director to recommend abatement of penalty or interest, the
Board may nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both.

under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property

successor entity.
 
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
 
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding

withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is

the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
 
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at

considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal corporation
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
          (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)

         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
 
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
 
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
       (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
 
   (E) Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax municipal corporation in which the
employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a small
employer as defined in Section
 192.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

192.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (G) of this Section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
192.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)    (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

192.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
192.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) and except as provided in
Division (G) of this section of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)    (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
 192.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section D of this Chapter on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section D of this Chapter.
   (H)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
 192.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (I)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 59-23. Passed 12-11-23.)
192.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
       (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
 
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
 
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
192.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
       (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
192.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
192.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
192.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
192.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
192.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
          (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent
under section 718.031 of the Ohio Revised Code are deemed to be paid to the
municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes
are withheld from the taxpayer's winnings.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
       (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before
the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under
division (G) of Section
192.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
 192.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
 192.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
 
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
       (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
192.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
192.081  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   The resident taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof,
pay to the administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereof, however,
where the tax so due has been deducted at the source pursuant to Section
191.06 (code before 1-1-16) or where the tax has been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to Section
191.07 (code before 1-1-16) to another municipality the taxpayer may claim
credit of these taxes limited to the amount paid to another municipality but in
no event shall said credit be no more than tax rate of 1%, which represents 50%
of Coshocton's City tax rate. All City residents must complete and file a tax
return regardless of whether any tax is due. (Ord. 21-15. Passed 7-13-15.)
192.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D) The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent the
taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
192.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
192.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
192.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
192.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
192.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
192.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support

   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the

        (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form

      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
 192.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
192.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
192.092 of this Chapter prevails.
  
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
192.051 of this Chapter.
        (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to

or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
 192.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
  
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the
examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's
refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax
Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by
the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about
matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
192.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the

corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.

for an extension under division (B) of this section.

thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
192.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.

that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including

documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)

taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on

Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
192.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
 192.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
 192.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.

Administrator.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
       (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
 192.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
 
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
       (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF AX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in ORC Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Members must be domiciled in the Municipal Corporation.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority (Council) of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official (Mayor) of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.    
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
       (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
192.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
192.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
192.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
 192.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 45-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
192.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.

Resolution, to adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the
Municipality.
192.21 ADOPTION OF R.C. 718.80 TO 718.95.

   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

192.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.

against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been

the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender

or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the
lessee presents proof that the person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability, and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section 501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to
this subsection (c).

   (a)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      (1)   “Private place” includes places privately owned but open to the
public generally, such as shopping centers, retail stores, transportation
terminals, movie theaters, office buildings, restaurants, and all distinctly
private places such as homes or private residences and apartment houses.
      (2)   “Public place” includes public streets and alleyways, public
restrooms, public sidewalks, public parks, public buildings and municipal
airports.
      (3)   “Surrounding area” means that area easily and immediately
accessible to the person under observation.
   (b)   Disorderly Conduct.
      (1)   No person shall recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm
to another by doing any of the following:
         A.   Engage in fighting, threaten harm to persons or property, or
engage in violent or turbulent behavior.
         B.   Make unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture,
or display, or communicate unwarranted and grossly abusive language to any
person.
         C.   Insult, taunt, or challenge another under circumstances in which
the conduct is likely to provoke a violent response.
         D.   Hinder or prevent the movement of persons on a public street,
road, highway, or right of way, or to, from, within or upon public or private
property, so as to interfere with the rights of others, by any act which serves
no lawful and reasonable purpose of the offender.
         E.   Create a condition which is physically offensive to persons or
which presents a risk of physical harm to persons or property by any act which
serves no lawful and reasonable purpose of the offender.
      (2)   No person, while voluntarily intoxicated shall in a public place or
in the presence of two or more persons engage in conduct likely to be offensive
or to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to persons of ordinary
sensibilities, which the offender, if he were not intoxicated, should know is
likely to have that effect on others; or engage in conduct or create a
condition which presents a risk of physical harm to himself or another, or to
the property of another. Violation of any statute or ordinance of which an
element is operating a motor vehicle, locomotive, watercraft, aircraft, or
other vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or any drug of abuse, is not
a violation of this subsection. When to an ordinary observer a person appears
to be intoxicated, it is probable cause to believe the person is voluntarily
intoxicated for purposes of this subsection.
   (c)   Unlawful Congregations.
      (1)   No person shall congregate with others in any public or private
place at a time, in a manner, or under circumstances which warrant alarm for
the safety of persons or security of property in the surrounding area; with
intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may be
occasioned by annoyance to pedestrians, or by threatening, insulting or abusive
conduct to them; or whereby a danger to passing motor vehicles or pedestrians
is created by persons sitting on, hanging on, laying on, or standing about,
parked motor vehicles, and refuse to move on when ordered to do so by a law
enforcement officer.
      (2)   Without limitation, the following circumstances may be considered
in determining whether the alarm is warranted.
         A.   The flight of a person on the appearance of a law enforcement
officer.
         B.   Attempted concealment by a person on the appearance of a law
enforcement officer.
         C.   The systematic checking by a person of doors, windows, or other
means of access to buildings, houses or vehicles.
      (3)   Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances make it
impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an
offense under this section, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm
which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him to identify himself and
explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense
under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with the
preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the
actor was true, and if believed by the law enforcement officer at the time,
would have dispelled the alarm.
   (d)   Penalty. Whoever violates any of the provisions of this section is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in this Permit or the Coshocton
Municipal Pretreatment Ordinance.
   (e)    Permit Modifications. The City reserves the right to amend this
Permit and the terms and condition thereof in order to assure compliance by the
City with applicable laws and regulations.
   (f)    Permit Conditions. Dischargers shall be expressly subject to all
provisions of the Coshocton Municipal Pretreatment Ordinance, Permit, and all
other applicable regulations, User charges and fees established by the City.

permit or Municipal Pretreatment Ordinance, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate, any monitoring devices or method required under
this permit shall, upon conviction, be punished by the imposition of a
misdemeanor of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment
for not more than six months.
   (p)    Records Retention. Users subject to the reporting requirements of the
Pretreatment Ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and
copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities required by the Pretreatment Ordinance, any additional records of
information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the User
independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best

   (b)    On premises either using water exclusively supplied by the City or
exclusively supplied from other sources, where the quantity of water used
thereon is not measured by a water meter or is measured by a water meter not
acceptable to the Director, the owner or other interested party shall, at his
expense, install and maintain a water meter acceptable to the Director and the
quantity of water used, as measured by the meter, shall determine the sewer
charge.
   (c)    On premises using water supplied both by the City and from other
sources, which in either case is not measured by a water meter or is measured
by a water meter not acceptable to the Director, the owner or other interested
party shall, at his expense, install and maintain water meters satisfactory to
the Director to measure all supplies of water, and the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer charge thereon, shall be the sum of the quantities of
water measured by the several meters.
   (d)    In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director with
respect to any premises that a portion of the water from any source used
thereon does not and cannot enter the system, then in that case the owner or
other interested party may proceed as follows:
      (1)    The owner or other interested party may, at his expense, install
and maintain separate water meters, where necessary, so as to show to the

showing discharge into the system, shall determine the sewer charge thereon.
      (2)    The owner or other interested party may, at his expense, install
and maintain a separate meter or meters to show to the satisfaction of the
Director what quantity of water used is not discharged into the system. The
quantity of water resulting by subtracting the quantity of water so measured
from the quantity of water used shall determine the sewer charge thereon.
      (3)    The owner or other interested party may use a combination of
subsections (d)(1) and (2) hereof satisfactory to the Director as a means of
measuring the quantity of sewage to be used in determining the sewer charge
thereon.

facilitate an efficient review time.)
      (4)   Two copies of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3). One
copy of the approved (SWP3) will be returned to the applicant.
   (b)   Criteria for the listed documentation must be the same as outlined in
the most current Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Pollution
Discharge Elimination (NPDES) General Storm Water Permit for Construction
Activities. Within 21 calendar days of the receipt of all documentation, the
City shall approve or disapprove the application for a sediment erosion control
permit. A statement of disapproval shall include the reason therefore and shall
identify the deficiencies in the documentation and shall state the procedures
for filing a revised plan. Upon receipt of revised documentation, the City
shall respond with approval or disapproval within 21 calendar days. Once final
approval has been made and a permit issued, any subsequent changes shall be
approved in writing by the City.
   (c)   The permitee must also obtain coverage under the Ohio EPA General
Construction Storm Water Permit before earth disturbance begins. A copy of the
Ohio EPA coverage letter shall be mailed to the City Service Director as
evidence of coverage. If the operator of a project fails to obtain Ohio EPA
General Construction Storm Water Permit coverage the project will be considered
an Illicit Discharge.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
963.04 STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   The applicant shall submit a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3)
consistent with the requirements set forth in the most recent Ohio EPA NPDES
General Construction Permit. For specific requirements of a SWP3 the designer
shall refer to SWP3 Check List. The SWP3 must address erosion and sediment
control during construction as well as post construction practices. Post
construction practices must meet the requirements of the most recent Ohio EPA
General Construction Stormwater Permit. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures as
recommended by the most current edition of Rainwater and Land Development
Manual as published by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources .
   (a)    Non-structural Post Construction Water Quality Practices. Non-
structural post construction best management practices include preservation,
planning or procedures that direct development away from water resources or
limit creation of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation
easements, riparian and wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design
are all non-structural controls.
      (1)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected from
disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
      (2)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
   (b)    Structural Water Quality Practices. Structural post construction best
management practices are permanent features constructed to provide treatment of
storm water runoff either through storage, filtration or infiltration.
      (1)   All structural water quality practices must be established prior to
the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control during development
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
      (2)   Maintenance. The post construction water quality practice must be
maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the Storm
Water Management Maintenance Agreement.

965.08    Notification of spills.
965.01 PURPOSE/INTENT.
   The purpose is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of the City through the regulation of non-storm water discharges to
the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable as required by
federal, state and local law. This Title Four establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives
of this Title Four are:
   (a)    To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by storm water
discharges by any user.
   (b)    To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4.
   (c)    To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
Title Four.
      (Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.02 APPLICABILITY.
   This
Title Four shall apply to all water entering the MS4 generated on any developed
or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the City.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.03 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)    Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water.
   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the
storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
   Waterline flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows; rising
ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration (infiltration is
defined as water other than wastewater that enters a sewer system, including
sewer service connections and foundation drains, from the ground through such
means as defective pipes, pipe joints, connections, or manholes. Infiltration
does not include, and is distinguished from, inflow.); uncontaminated pumped
ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains; air
conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; discharges or flows from fire fighting activities; and
discharges specified in writing by the City as being necessary to protect
public health and safety. Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a
verbal notification to the City prior to the time of the test. The prohibition
shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES
permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and
administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (b)    Prohibition of Illicit Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain
system is prohibited.
   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections
made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under
law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
   (c)    A person is considered to be in violation of this Title Four if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.04  SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)    Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
City may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when
such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the State. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the City may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage
to the MS4 or waters of the State, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this Title Four may have his/her MS4
access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The City will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the City for a reconsideration and
hearing.
   (c)    A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
City.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.05 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City
prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.06 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY THE
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The City will require Best Management Practices for any activity, operation
or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
storm water, the MS4, or waters of the State. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his/her own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural
and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-
structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with Chapter 963, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.07  WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, and other obstacles that would pollute and
contaminate. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately
owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures
will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the
watercourse.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
965.08  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the State
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment
and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City in person or by
phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person
or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
City within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)

designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
967.04 ACCESS TO FACILITIES.
   (a)    The City may enter a site at any time during normal business hours

day thereafter until the violation is corrected. Each day that a violation of
this Title Four exists shall constitute a separate offense
   (c)    In addition to the remedies and civil penalties set forth above, the
City may bring legal action to enjoin the continuing violation of this Title
Four, and the existence of any other remedy, at law or equity, shall be no
defense to any such actions.
   (d)    The remedies and penalties set forth in this section shall be
cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil
or criminal, that one or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought
or granted. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property
is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise
that, if the violator fails to remediate or restore within the established
deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a

the assessment within 30 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely
manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the

the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
(Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-09.)
967.10 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Compliance with the provisions of this Title Four shall not relieve any

declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
validity of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)    No part of this Title Four shall be construed as authorizing any
person to maintain a private or public nuisance on their property, and
compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any
action to abate such a nuisance.
   (d)    Failure of the City to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the site owner
from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from, and
shall not result in the City, its officers, employees or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting there from.
   (e)    The City shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of
this Title Four. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the City may be
delegated in writing by the City Service Director to persons or entities acting
in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the agency, e.g., Coshocton
Soil and Water Conservation District or the City Engineer.
   (f)    The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this Title
Four are minimum standards; therefore this Title Four does not intend nor imply
that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. 30-09. Passed 5-26-
09.)

court for such structure shall be determined by increasing the minimum width or
depth for the highest structure permitted in such more restricted district by
one foot for each two feet by which the proposed structure exceeds the maximum
height permitted in the more restricted district. (Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)

except an off-street parking area subject to the provisions of Chapter
1147, shall be permitted nearer to any front lot line than 60 feet, unless such
use or structure is contained within or connected thereto, provided that in the
case of a corner lot where choice by the owner of the longer street lot line
has been approved as the front lot line, this requirement shall apply only to
the distance of an accessory building from the shorter street lot line.

1145.03 through
1145.06, an accessory building, if not located in the rear yard, shall be an

1115.04 DIVIDED LOT; EXTENSION OF DISTRICT.
    Where a district boundary line established in this chapter or as shown on
the zoning map divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of
enactment of this chapter, the use authorized thereon and the other district
requirements applying to the least restricted portion of such lot under this
chapter shall be considered as extending to the entire lot, provided the more

1143.01 CONTINUATION OF EXISTING USES.
   Except as hereinafter specified, any use, building, or structure existing at
the time of the enactment of this chapter may be continued, even though such
use, building, or structure may not conform with the provisions of this chapter
for the district in which it is located.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1143.02 EXTENSIONS; SUBSTITUTIONS; CHANGE TO CONFORMING USE.
   No existing building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which such building or premises is located, except
when required to do so by law or order, shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, substituted, or structurally altered unless the use thereof is
changed to a use permitted in the district in which such building or premises
is located, and except as follows:
   (a)   Substitution or Extension. When authorized by the Board, in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter
1109, the substitution for a nonconforming use of another not more
objectionable nonconforming use, or an extension of a nonconforming use, may be
made, but not both a substitution and an extension.
   (b)    Extension on Adjoining Lot. When authorized by the Board, in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1109, the extension or completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use
on a lot occupied by such building, or on a lot adjoining, may be made,
provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot in question on
the date the use of such building became nonconforming, and where such
extension is necessary and identical to the existing use of such building.
   (c)    Extension Inside Building. When authorized by the Board, in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1109, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout those parts of a building
which were manifestly designed and arranged for such use prior to the date when
such use of the building became nonconforming, if no structural alterations,
except those required by law, are made therein.
   (d)    Nonconforming Use Made To Conform. Whenever a nonconforming use has
been changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a
nonconforming use.
      (Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1143.03 REESTABLISHMENT OF ABANDONED USE.
   No building, structure, or premises where a nonconforming use has ceased for

1143.04 DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   All nonconforming uses of land not involving any building or structure may
be continued for a period of two years after the date of enactment of this
chapter, at the end of which period such nonconforming use shall cease or shall
be changed to a conforming use.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1143.05 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS VIOLATIONS.
   All uses nonconforming at the time of adoption of this chapter, by reason of

of damage by fire, flood, explosion, wind, earthquake, war, riot or other
calamity, or act of God, shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as
before such occurrence, but if less than sixty percent (60%) damaged above the
foundation, it may be restored, reconstructed, or used as before, provided that
it is done within six months of such occurrence.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1143.07 REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS.

1145.01 LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record at the effective date of
this chapter, irrespective of its area or width, the owner of which does not
own any adjoining property, provided that yard spaces satisfy requirements
stipulated for the district in which such lot is located, or requirements as
may be modified under Section
1145.03(c) or by the Board, as set forth in Section
1109.12.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.02  HEIGHT MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Exceptions. The height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this
chapter shall not apply to the following:
      (1)    Farm buildings and architectural features. Barns, silos, or other
farm buildings or structures on farms; church spires, belfries, cupolas and
domes, monuments, water towers, fire and hose towers, observation towers,
transmission towers, windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, flag poles, radio
towers, masts and aerials; parapet walls extending not more than four feet
above the limiting height of the building.
      (2)    Places of public assembly. Places of public assembly in churches,
schools, and other permitted public and semipublic buildings, provided that
these are located on the first floor of such buildings and provided that for
each three feet by which the height of such building exceeds the maximum height
otherwise permitted in the district, its side and rear yards shall be increased
in width or depth by an additional foot over the side and rear yards required
for the highest building otherwise permitted in the district.
      (3)    Elevator penthouses, water tanks, and towers. Bulkheads, elevator
penthouses, water tanks, monitors, and scenery lofts, provided no linear
dimensions of any such structure exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
corresponding street lot line frontage; towers and monuments, fire towers, hose
towers, cooling towers, grain elevators, gas holders, or other structures where
the manufacturing process requires a greater height.
   (b)   Minimum Requirements. All such structures above the heights otherwise
permitted in the district shall not occupy more than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the area of the lot and shall be distant not less than 50 feet in all parts
from every lot line not a street lot line.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.03 FRONT YARD DEPTHS; SLOPED AND DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS.
   (a)    Average Depth of Front Yards. In any R District, where the average
depth of at least two existing front yards on lots within 100 feet of the lot
in question, and within the same block front, is less or greater than the least
front yard depth prescribed elsewhere in this chapter, the required depth of
the front yard on such lot shall be modified. In such case, this shall not be
less than the average depth of such existing front yards or the average depth
on the two lots immediately adjoining or, in the case of a corner lot, the
depth of the front yard on the lot immediately adjoining. However, the depth of
a front yard on any lot shall be at least ten feet and need not exceed 50 feet.
   (b)    Front Yard Garage on Steep Sloped Lots. In any R District where the
natural grade of a lot within the required front yard has an average slope,
normal to the front lot line at every point along such line, of such a degree
or percent of slope that it is not practicable to provide a driveway with a
grade of twelve percent (12%) or less to a private garage conforming with the
requirements of this chapter, such garage may be located within such front
yard, but not in any case closer than six feet from the street line.
   (c)    Double Frontage Lots. Buildings on lots having frontage on two
nonintersecting streets need not have a rear yard if an equivalent open space
is provided on the lot in lieu of such required rear yard; applicable front
yards must be provided, however, on both streets.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.04 COMPUTATION OF YARDS ABUTTING ALLEYS.
   In computing the depth of a rear yard or the width of a side yard, where the
rear or side yard abuts an alley, one-half of the width of the alley may be
included as a portion of the required rear or side yard, as the case may be.
However, no side yard shall be less at any point than three feet, and no rear
yard less than ten feet.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.05 SIDE YARD MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Increases. Each side yard, where required, shall be increased in
width by two inches for each foot by which the length of the side wall of the
building adjacent to the side yard exceeds 40 feet.
   (b)    Variation Where Walls not Parallel to Lot Line. Side yard width may
be varied where the side wall of a building is not parallel with the side lot
line or is broken or otherwise irregular. In such case the average width of the
side yard shall not be less than the otherwise required least width. However,
such side yard shall not be narrower at any point than one-half the otherwise
required least width, or narrower than three feet in any case.
   (c)    Corner Lots. A side yard along the side street lot line of a corner
lot, which lot abuts in the rear, either directly or across an alley, the side
lot line of another lot in an R District, shall have a width of not less than
one-half the required depth of the front yard on such other lot fronting the
side street.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.06 REDUCTION OF REAR AND SIDE YARDS.
   Depth of a rear yard or width of each side yard may be reduced by four
inches for each foot by which a lot at the time of enactment of this chapter is
less than 100 feet deep or less than 50 feet wide, provided, that no side yard
shall be less at any point than three feet, or less, in the case of a side yard
along a side street lot line, than five feet, and provided that no rear yard
shall be less than ten feet. Width of one side yard may be reduced when
authorized by the Board, in the case of a one-family or two-family dwelling, to
a width of not less than three feet, provided the sum of the widths of the two
side yards is not less than the required minimum, and provided the distance
between the proposed dwelling and another dwelling, existing or proposed, on an
adjacent lot is not less than the required minimum sum of the widths of two
side yards. However, such reduction may be authorized only when the Board finds
it to be warranted by the location of existing buildings or conducive to the
desirable development of two or more lots.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.07 YARD PROJECTIONS.
   Certain architectural features may project into required yards or courts as
follows:
   (a)    Front and Side Yards. Into any required front yard, or required side
yard adjoining a side street lot line, as follows:
      (1)    Cornices, canopies, eaves, or other architectural features may
project a distance not exceeding two feet, six inches.
      (2)    Fire escapes may project a distance not exceeding four feet, six

exceeding three feet, provided that such features do not occupy, in the
aggregate, more than one-third of the length of the building wall on which they
are located.
   (b)    Interior Side Yards. Subject to the limitations in subsection (a)
above, the above- named features may project into any required side yard
adjoining an interior side lot line a distance not to exceed one-third of the
required least width of such side yard, but not exceeding three feet in any
case.
   (c)    Rear Yards. Subject to the limitation in subsection (b) above, the
features named therein may project into any required rear yards the same
distances they are permitted to project into a front yard. However, landings or
porches may be covered and may project a distance not exceeding ten feet, but
not closer than ten feet from the rear lot line.
      (Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.08 FENCES, WALLS, AND HEDGES.
   Fences, walls, and hedges may be located in required yards as follows:
   (a)    If not exceeding, at any point, four feet in height above the
elevation of the surface of the ground at such point, such features may be
located h any yard.
   (b)    If not exceeding, at any point, six feet in height above the
elevation of the surface of the ground at such point, they may be located in
any required rear yard or side yard. (Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1145.09 AREA REQUIREMENTS WHERE SANITARY FACILITIES NOT AVAILABLE.
   In any district, where neither a public water supply nor a public sanitary
sewer is accessible, the otherwise specified lot area and frontage
requirements, if less than the following, shall be lot area, 20,000 square feet
and lot frontage at building line, 100 feet. However, where a public water

uses, FLOOR AREA means the gross floor area used or intended to be used by
tenants, or for service to the public as customers, patrons, clients, or
patients, including areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display
or sale of merchandise. The term FLOOR AREA does not include areas used
principally for nonpublic purposes, such as storage, incidental repair,
processing, or packaging of merchandise; for show windows, offices incidental
to the management or maintenance of stores or buildings, toilet or rest rooms,
utilities or for dressing rooms, fitting or alteration rooms.

seat for the purpose of determining requirements for off-street parking
facilities.
      (Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1147.05 CHANGES IN USE, ADDITIONS, AND ENLARGEMENTS.
   Whenever in any building there is a change in use, or an increase in floor
area or in the number of employees or other unit of measurement hereinafter
specified for the determination of required off-street parking spaces,
additional off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the basis of the
increased requirements of the new use or other unit of measurement. However, in
case such change in use creates a need for an increase in off-street parking
spaces of less than ten percent (10%) of the parking facilities previously
provided, no additional parking facilities shall be required. (Ord. 4-62.
Passed 3-12-62.)
1147.06 MIXED OCCUPANCIES AND USES NOT SPECIFIED.
   In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking
facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed
separately. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in Section
1147.09, the requirements for off-street parking facilities for a use which is
so mentioned, and to which such use is similar, shall apply. Off-street parking
facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking
facilities for any other use, except as specified for joint use in Section
1147.08.
(Ord. 4-62. Passed 3-12-62.)
1147.07 COLLECTIVE PROVISION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collective provision
of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses, provided

for certain other kinds of buildings or uses specified in subsection (b) below,
which are not normally open, used or operated during the principal operating
hours of theaters, churches, or the aforesaid establishments, and not more than
fifty percent (50%) of the off-street parking facilities required under this
chapter for certain buildings or uses specified in subsection (b) below may be
supplied by such facilities provided for theaters, churches, or other aforesaid
establishments, provided that a properly drawn legal instrument is executed by
the parties concerned for the joint use of the off-street parking facilities.
Such instrument, duly approved as to form and manner of execution by the Law
Director, shall be filed with the application for a building permit.
   (b)    Buildings or uses not normally open, used, or operated during the
principal operating hours of theaters, churches, or other of the aforesaid
establishments are defined as banks, business offices, retail stores, personal

CHAPTER 1158
Towers, Antennas, Facilities, Etc.
1158.01   Definitions.
1158.02   Location criteria.
1158.03   Design criteria.
1158.04   Aesthetics.
1158.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a) Wireless Telecommunication Antennas shall mean the physical device of
which electromagnetic, wireless telecommunications signals authorized by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are transmitted or received. Antennas
used by amateur radio operators are excluded from this definition.
   (b) Wireless Telecommunication Equipment Shelter shall mean the structure or
cabinet in which the electronic receiving and relay equipment for a wireless
telecommunication facility is housed.
   (c)    Wireless Telecommunication Facility shall mean a facility consisting
of the equipment and structures involved in receiving telecommunications or
radio signals from a mobile radio communication source and transmitting those
signals to a central switching computer which connects the mobile unit with the
land-base telephone lines for provision of personal wireless services.
   (d)    Wireless Telecommunication Tower shall mean any structure that
elevates the wireless communication antenna and may include accessory
transmission and receiving equipment.
(Ord. 21-16. Passed 6-27-16.)
1158.02  LOCATION CRITERIA.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities, towers, and related structures may
be located in any zoning district, other than residential districts, as
established by Coshocton City Code and located according to the Official Zoning
Map, as a conditional use. Said facilities are only permitted in residential
zoning districts as set forth below. Generally, wireless telecommunications
towers are objectionable in residential areas because their use is industrial
in nature, and may be objectionable in the community at large because they are
frequently considerably taller that surrounding structures, causing them to be
seen from long distances. Their location is therefore regulated as permitted by
the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to time be
amended. Prior to approval, the provider shall demonstrate by clear and
convincing evidence that if towers and related wireless telecommunications
facilities are located in the City of Coshocton, they shall not adversely
affect the natural or man-made environment or the architectural setting, and
that their location shall not pose a reasonable risk to the health and safety
of residents.
   (a)    Priority. In order to accommodate the communications needs of
residents and businesses while protecting the health, safety, and general
welfare, the City of Coshocton recommends and encourages the placement of
wireless telecommunications facilities and towers in non-residential areas, in
the following order of preference:
      (1)   City-owned property.
      (2)   Industrial areas.
      (3)   Quasi-public areas.
      (4)   Business districts, excluding the Old Town Coshocton and Roscoe
Village.
      (5)   Other non-residential districts deemed appropriate by review of the
Planning Commission and approval of City Council.
   (b)   Sole use on a lot. A wireless telecommunications tower and related
facilities are permitted as the sole use on a lot, and may be permitted, by
approval of the appropriate Board, on lots containing other uses where existing
structures enable co-usage, including on City-owned property.
   (c)    Placement in residential zoning districts. In order to locate
wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities in residential zoning
districts, the applicant service provider shall demonstrate to the appropriate
Board that there are sound technical and geographic reasons for doing so, such
as: (i) written verification that offers to co-locate with other providers or
placement as a co-usage with other structures within Coshocton or neighboring
communities have proven ineffective, or (ii) evidence that, in order to provide
wireless telecommunications services to the residents and businesses in a
manner that serves their best interests, such towers and facilities may only be
placed in a residential zoning district.
   (d)   Co-location and co-usage. In all districts, co-location and co-usage
shall be explored as the primary means of locating towers and/or antennas. When
a wireless telecommunications facility is located in conformity with this
section, and the antenna(s) is (are) placed as a co-usage and is (are) attached
to an institutional, recreational, public utility, office, industrial, or
commercial structure or building, equipment and apparatus supporting a facility
shall be stored on the premises inside the wireless telecommunications
equipment building or other structure on the premises of the facility.
   (e)    Setbacks. For purposes of this section only, any provision of this
Planning and Zoning Code notwithstanding, the setback for a tower of any
variety, including monopole, shall be measured from the base of the tower at
the point where it is placed in the ground to the property line. The exception
to this regulation is when a tower or antenna is placed or affixed as a co-
usage, in which case the setback shall be measured from the base of the tower
or antenna at the point where it is placed on the existing structure to the
property line.
      (1)   An equipment building and all other structures, except the tower,
shall be set back the minimum distance required in the zoning district.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided herein, in industrial zoning
districts, the setback for the tower shall be at least fifty percent of the
total height of the tower. A minimum of seventy-five feet shall be required.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided herein, in non- industrial zoning
districts, the setback for the tower shall be seventy-five percent of the total
height of the tower. A minimum of seventy-five feet shall be required.
      (4)   In any zoning district where the lot on which a tower is located
abuts another lot on which is located a school of any type, including
institutions of higher learning beyond high school level, public or private
parks (but not including golf courses), hospitals, playgrounds, day care
centers, health centers, or other human services and educational uses, the
setback for a tower shall be equal to the total height of the tower.
      (5)   In any zoning district where a lot on which a tower is located
abuts any lot within a residential zoning district of any classification, the
setback for a tower shall be equal to the total height of the tower.
      (6)   Guy wires may be anchored within the required setback area only if
the tower itself is placed in conformity with this section regarding setbacks,
but guy wires and other similar supporting devices shall be not less than ten
feet from any adjoining lot, regardless of the underlying zoning district.
   (f)    Amateur radio towers. Towers supporting amateur radio antennas and
conforming to all applicable provisions of this section shall be permitted in
residential zoning districts, but not as a sole use of a lot, and only in the
rear yard of such parcels, as defined in this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (g)    Government placement. The City of Coshocton may locate wireless
telecommunications towers and related facilities in residential zoning
districts, even as the sole use of the lot, but only on publicly owned
property. The City of Coshocton may contract with private wireless
telecommunications service providers to locate a tower and related facilities
on City-owned property in residential zoning districts, provided that all
provisions of this section are followed.
   (h)    Open space. Wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities
are permitted on land which has been established as permanent open space or a
park, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   In order to locate wireless telecommunications towers and related
facilities in permanent open space or park lands, the applicant/service
provider shall demonstrate to the appropriate Board that there are sound
technical and geographic reasons for doing so, such as: (i) written
verification that offers to co-locate with other providers or placement as a
co-usage with other structures within the City of Coshocton or neighboring
communities have proven ineffective, or (ii) evidence that, in order to provide
wireless telecommunications services to the residents and businesses in a
manner that serves their best interests, such towers and facilities may only be
placed in open space or in park lands.
      (2)   The open space shall be owned and overseen by the City of
Coshocton, the State of Ohio, the United States of America, other governmental
or quasi-governmental agencies, a private homeowners association, or a private,
non-profit conservation organization.
      (3)   In permanent open space or park lands, all towers shall be
camouflaged using the best and most advanced techniques possible.
      (4)   Other setback provisions of this section notwithstanding, the tower
shall be set back a minimum of 200 feet from any single family residential
zoning district.
   (i)   Subordinate to surrounding uses. Towers and related wireless
telecommunications facilities shall be placed, constructed, and modified
subordinate and in deference to the use of private, residentially zoned or used
property, by minimizing the visual effect on residential properties, and to
minimize the visual, often unattractive, impact towers and related wireless
telecommunications facilities create when viewing them from a distance.
      (Ord. 21-16. Passed 6-27-16.)
1158.03  DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Co-location ability. Any wireless telecommunications tower shall be
designed, structurally and electrically, to accommodate both the applicant's
antenna and, at a minimum, comparable antennas for at least two additional
service providers if the tower is at least 100 feet in total height, or for one
additional service provider if the tower is at least thirty feet in total
height. Towers shall be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas
on the tower and to accept antennas mounted at various heights.
   (b)   Maximum height. The maximum height of a tower shall not exceed 200
feet, unless a technically sound and required reason for locating a higher
tower is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the appropriate Board and the City
Council to be in order, on a case by case basis, by the wireless
telecommunications service provider making the request. Approval for other
similar projects does not necessarily constitute a technically sound and
required reason for subsequent projects; therefore, service providers are
cautioned to develop proof and reasoning independent of other projects. When a
higher tower is required by a provision of law consistent with the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to time be amended, the
provider shall submit written verification of such fact. Towers less than 200
feet in height are especially encouraged. Wireless telecommunications towers
higher than 200 feet or located within 2,500 feet of any airport runway, public
or private, shall be registered with the FAA. The provider/operator of such
tower shall submit written verification of such registration with the FAA.
   (c)   Underground facilities. Underground wireless telecommunications
equipment buildings are especially encouraged, especially on zoning lots in, or
abutting, residential zoning districts where a tower is placed. (Ord. 21-16.
Passed 6-27-16.)
1158.04 AESTHETICS.
   (a)   Landscaping. All towers and related wireless telecommunications
facilities shall be located in a landscaped setting. A landscaped buffer area
of not less than ten feet in depth shall be placed between the wireless
telecommunications facility and the public right-of-way, residential zoning
district, and any adjacent residential use, regardless of the underlying zoning
district thereof. Such buffer area shall, at a minimum, consist of dense
foliage and vegetation, of at least partially evergreen species, not less than
six feet in height. Landscaping shall be continuously maintained and promptly
reconditioned, if necessary. Other landscaping may be required by the City. The
arrangement of landscaping and the overall design thereof within a zoning lot
on which a wireless telecommunications tower and related facility is placed may
be considered by the City.
   (b)   Fencing. Fencing shall be provided for appearance, public safety, and
personal security, according to the following requirements:
   
   
 
                                            Minimum (in ft.) Maximum (in ft.)
(1) Height. Any residential zoning district 6                8
Any commercial zoning district              6                8
Any industrial zoning district              6                8
      (2)   Type.  In any zoning district, the fencing shall consist of a chain
link fence. Fencing in an industrial zoning district may be capped with barbed
wire a maximum of twelve inches. The barbed wire portion, if any, shall be
included in the measurement of the total height of such fencing.
      (3)   Color. Fencing may be unpainted or painted to blend into the
surrounding area.
      (4)   Security. Access to the tower and related wireless
telecommunications facilities shall only be through a locked gate, properly
maintained and secured twenty-four hours per day. The City of Coshocton shall
not be responsible for any damage to the tower or other auxiliary structures,
and shall be held harmless from any liability of any kind relating to damage,
destruction, misfeasance of the tower or auxiliary structures, and from any
personal injury to any party.
   (c)    Illumination.  Lighting shall be required for that part of towers in
excess of 100 feet, or as otherwise required by the FAA. When such lighting is
required by the FAA or other governmental authority, and the zoning lot on
which a tower is located abuts any residential zoning district, it shall be
oriented inward of the zoning lot and shall not project, or be cast, onto any
or all abutting zoning lots within residential zoning districts. Except as
previously detailed or as required by law or safety factors as determined by
the City of Coshocton, an antenna or tower shall not be illuminated, and
lighting fixtures or signs, other than those sanctioned by this section, shall
not be attached to an antenna or tower. Security lighting shall be permitted
for the wireless telecommunications equipment building and other auxiliary
structures. Any permitted lighting shall be situated and directed so as not to
emit light directly or indirectly onto any adjoining residential property, and,
in any zoning district, such lighting shall be designed, placed, and directed
to minimize its emission and glare onto any adjoining property.
   (d)    Signs, symbols/logos, advertising, identification. Identification of
towers and related wireless telecommunications facilities shall be permitted if
required by the FCC, the FAA, the Federal or State EPA, OSHA, or other
governmental agency for regulation or identification purposes, as necessary,
pursuant to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, as may from time to
time be amended, or other applicable law. The City of Coshocton shall be
permitted to require identification signs. A tower or related wireless
telecommunications facility shall contain no symbols/logos. The fencing
surrounding the wireless telecommunications equipment building shall contain
the appropriate number of signs to warn the public of danger and, also, at
least two signs stating "NO TRESPASSING", and a sign identifying the wireless
telecommunications service provider, of a type, size, and color as approved by
the City. No advertising whatever shall be permitted on towers or related
wireless telecommunications facilities, unless required by law. All such signs
shall be permanently attached to the tower or other wireless telecommunications
structure and shall be placed at least four feet above grade. The only colors
permitted shall be black, white, red, yellow, orange, or any combination of
these colors. Signs shall not be illuminated in any manner. Luminous paint may
be used on signs, if approved by the City.
   (e)    Camouflaging.
      (1)   The City may require additional landscaping as part of a camouflage
plan. Camouflaging of towers is especially encouraged in all zoning districts,
but shall be required using the most advanced techniques possible in all
residential zoning districts.
      (2)   Camouflaging may take the form of erecting a tower which resembles
or mimics another object, such as a tree or flag pole. Camouflaging may also
consist of placing antennas on existing structures such as water towers or
buildings in such a way that they are not easily detected and cannot be seen by
the naked eye from a long distance.
      (3)   A building or other structure may be a prop only, that is, unused
and unusable as anything but a device to camouflage an antenna. It shall be
aesthetically pleasing and maintained continuously.
      (4)   Camouflaging, whatever variety and however employed, shall be of a
type compatible with the immediate surrounding area and the City at large in
color, design, material, appearance, and its method of mimicry. For example, an
artificial oak tree, 100 feet in height would satisfy this requirement. An
artificial palm tree would not.
      (5)   Antennas may be placed on facades of buildings if colored and
designed to match the color, texture, and style of the building to which it is
attached, and shall be attached at least twenty-five feet above grade.
      (6)   Wireless telecommunications towers and related facilities shall not
be located in the district known as "the Old Town Coshocton or Roscoe Village"
or any other district which shall become so designated as a historically and/or
architecturally significant district, or as a special district recognized and
set apart as significant to the community's heritage or traditions, unless it
is proven that in order to provide wireless telecommunications service, such
towers or facilities may not be located elsewhere within the City of Coshocton.
      (7)   Colors of towers. All towers of any type shall be of a color which
blends into the natural color of the immediate area or skyline, but shall not
be painted at all, if by coloring the tower, it would be more visible to the
naked eye from a long distance than if it were erected in the ordinary tone of
its construction materials, such as the grayish color of galvanized steel. If
towers are painted, they shall be maintained within the requirements of the
City's property maintenance codes.
      (8)   A non-refundable fee of $1,000.00 shall be paid to the City of
Coshocton for review of the application for a telecommunication tower by the
Planning Commission. In addition, applicant shall be responsible for fees
incurred to hire an outside contractor to review plans. All other permits &
fees must be obtained and paid prior to erection, if the tower is approved.
      (9)   No person shall construct, erect, maintain, extend or remove a
wireless telecommunication facility in the City without compliance with the
provisions of this Code.

including schools as indicated on the Comprehensive Plan or other City or
County plans promulgated therefrom in which the subdivision is located, the
same to be made available by one of the following methods as required by the
Commission:
   (a)   Open Space.
      (1)    The dedication to public use on the plat of the parcel proposed
for subdivision of a parcel of land equal to at least four percent (4%) of the
parcel proposed for subdivision;
      (2)    The conveyance by deed to an appropriate public body of a parcel
of land equal to at least four percent (4%) of the parcel proposed for
subdivision;
      (3)    A conveyance or reservation to the owners of land within the
proposed subdivision of a parcel of land equal to at least four percent (4%) of
the parcel proposed for subdivision for use of the property owners within the
subdivision; or
      (4)    Cash equal to four percent (4%) of the raw land acquisition cost
of the parcel proposed for subdivision, based on the current market value as
expressed by the county tax duplicate. Payment of such cash shall be deposited
in a special City fund, and used to purchase or improve public open space land
which will serve the subdivision for which the payment is made.
    (b)    Public Sites.
      (1)    The dedication for public use of land in such reasonable amount as
may be determined by the Commission.
      (2)   The reservation for acquisition by the school district within which
land is located within a period of 18 months, of land in such reasonable amount
as may be determined by the Commission. The reservation shall be made in such a
manner as to provide for a release of the land to the subdivider in the event
no public agency proceeds with the purchase. The 18 months reservation shall
begin with the date all or any part of the proposed subdivision is officially
recorded.
   (c)    Designation. Each open space and public site, utility easement, and
other area to be dedicated as designated on the plat, shall be so designated as
to indicate the purpose of the dedication and to whom it is to be dedicated.
   (d)   Natural Features. Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding
natural features such as scenic spots, water courses, or exceptional groves of
trees.
      (Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76.)
1171.04 EASEMENTS.
   Private and public utility easements shall have a minimum width of 16 feet
or such additional width as may be required by the City Engineer for necessary
access to the utility involved. Such easements shall be located along rear or
side lot lines except under special circumstances where the Commission may
require them in other locations. For lots facing curvilinear streets, the rear
easements shall consist of straight lines with a minimum of points of
deflection. (Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76.)
1171.05 STREETS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all
streets shall conform to and shall be considered in their relation to existing
and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and
safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be
served by such streets. The developer shall provide within the boundaries of
the subdivision plat the necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance,
or alignment of such streets by dedication of the necessary right-of-way for
the continuation, extension, or connection of any present or planned highway or
street. When subdividing land fronting on an existing street not designated on
the Comprehensive Plan or other City or county plans promulgated therefrom,
reasonable provision shall be made by the developer for necessary right-of-way
or easements from traffic, utilities, and drainage.
   (a)    Arrangement.
      (1)    Physical barriers. Where a subdivision borders on, or contains a
railroad right-of-way or limited-access highway right-of-way, the Commission
may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-
of- way, at a distance suitable for necessary traffic circulation.
      (2)    Highways and major streets. When a subdivision abuts or contains
an existing limited-access highway or major street as designated on the
Comprehensive Plan or other City or county plans promulgated therefrom, the
Commission may require any of the following:
         A.   Marginal access streets.
         B.   Reverse frontage with planting contained in a nonaccess public
reservation along the rear property line or a planting strip of a minimum width
of 20 feet on the rear of the lots with no vehicular access across such strip.
         C.   Deep lots with rear service alleys.
         D.   Such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection
of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local
traffic.
      (3)    Collector and minor streets. The street layout shall make
provision for the proper protection and continuance of streets into adjacent
unsubdivided acreage where it is deemed appropriate and desirable by the
Commission. Local streets shall be laid out in such a manner as to discourage
through traffic.
      (4)    Continuity. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of
the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission may require a sketch of a
future street system for the unsubdivided portion.
      (5)    Reserve strips. Land which would control the extension or access
to streets shall be prohibited.
   (b)    Alignment.
      (1)    Horizontal. 
         A.   Intersection approaches. Approaches to street intersections shall
be perpendicular for a distance of at least 100 feet from the centerline of the
street intersected. The Commission may modify this requirement when an
unreasonable hardship would result from its strict enforcement.
         B.   Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all but minor and marginal access streets.
The Commission may modify this requirement when an unreasonable hardship would
result from its strict enforcement.
      (2)    Vertical. Grades at intersection. Approaches to intersections
shall be reduced to grade not exceeding three percent (3%) for a distance of at
least 150 feet from the centerline of the street intersected. The Commission
may modify this requirement when an unreasonable hardship would result from its
strict enforcement.
   (c)    Classifications. The Commission approving each street in a proposed
subdivision, shall be governed by the standards set forth in the following
table:
 
                                  Maximum Degree Minimum Radius
Street           Minimum Right of of             of             Maximum Grade
Classification   Way              Curvature      Curvature in   Percent
                                                 Feet
Limited- access  200 ft.          (a)            (a)            (a)
highway
Major street     80 ft.           5              300 ft.        10
Collector street 60 ft.           10             150 ft.        14
Local street     50 ft.           10             150 ft.        14
(a) Requirement will be based on design.
 
   (d)   Corner Radii. Property lines at street right-of-way intersections
should be rounded with a radius of 20 feet or of a greater radius where the
Commission may deem it necessary.
   (e)    Cul-de-sacs. Permanently designed cul-de-sacs shall not be longer
than 1,000 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around
having a street property line diameter of at least 120 feet. The street right-
of-way lines and the 120 feet diameter turn-around should be joined by tangent
arcs of 50 feet minimum radius.
   (f)    Street Terminals. Where streets are extended to the boundary of a
subdivision to provide for their proper continuance at such time as the
adjacent land is subdivided, the Commission may require a temporary turn-around
with a minimum radius of 60 feet provided, however, that if a street extends
only one lot depth past a street intersection, no turn-around is required. The
type of pavement of street terminals shall be subject to approval by the
Director of Public Safety and Service.
   (g)   Half-Streets. Half-streets shall be prohibited except in cases where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
   (h)    Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in apartment, commercial, and
industrial districts, except that the Commission may waive this requirement
where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as
off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the
uses proposed. Alleys shall be prohibited in one and two-family districts
except where it is desirable to continue an existing alley to the nearest
intersection or where the lots face a street shown on the Comprehensive Plan or
other City or county plans promulgated therefrom, and provision has not or
cannot be made for limited access on such street, or where special approval of
the Commission is granted. The minimum width of an alley shall be 24 feet.
Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where
necessary; corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular
movement.
   (i)    Sidewalks. Where the Commission determines that sidewalks are
feasible, they shall be provided by the developer in accordance with
improvement standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Street Trees. Trees which have undesirable characteristics such as
excessively thick foliage, low branches, unpleasant odors, susceptibility to
disease or attack by insects or large root systems, such as Poplar, Willow,
Cottonwood, American Elm, nut and fruit trees, Ailanthus, Mountain Ash, and
Oregon Maple, shall be prohibited in the tree lawn and within 25 feet of a
public sewer; Poplar, Willow, or Cottonwood trees if planted on private
property in the city shall be located not less than 100 feet from any public
sewer.
   (k)    Street Names. Names of new streets shall not duplicate, or be similar
to, existing dedicated streets. New streets which are extensions of or in
alignment with existing streets shall bear the name of the existing streets.
All street names must be approved by the Commission.
      (Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76; Ord. 102-79. Passed 1-28-80; Ord. 72-83.
Passed 12-12-83.)
1171.06 BLOCKS.
   Blocks shall not exceed 1,500 feet in length, or be less than 400 feet in
width, except where topographical conditions require other dimensions. The
length, width, and shape of blocks shall be designed with due regard to the
provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type
of use contemplated; zoning requirements and the requirements contained in
these regulations as to lot size and dimension; the need for convenient access,
circulation, control, and safety of street traffic; and the limitations and
opportunities of topography.
(Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76.)
1171.07 LOTS.
    The lot size, width, depth, shape, orientation, and the minimum setback
line shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type
of development and use contemplated in order to secure and provide for the
proper arrangement of existing or planned streets, adequate and convenient open
space, utilities, access of fire fighting apparatus, light, air, and for the
avoidance of congestion of population.
   (a)    Area and Shape. Lot areas shall be at least as large as the minimum
requirements of the City's Zoning Code, or as otherwise provided for in the
County Subdivision Regulations. The Commission may limit to a maximum ratio of
3-1/2 to 1 the depth to width of lots for the most efficient use of land.
   (b)    Ingress and Egress. The subdividing of land shall be such as to
provide each lot with frontage on a public street.
   (c)    Double and Reverse Frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage
lots may be allowed where they are essential to provide separation of
residential development from major streets or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least 20 feet, and across which there would be no right of access should be
provided along the line of lots abutting such traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use.
   (d)    Building Lines. Building setback side rear yard lines shall be at
least as large as the minimum requirements of the City Zoning Code, or as
otherwise provided for in the County Subdivision Regulations.
   (e)   Lot Identification. All lots shall be numbered by the County Recorder.
      (Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76.)
1171.08 SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The subdivision name shall not duplicate, be similar to, or be in conflict
with the names of any existing subdivisions in the City or County, or any
previously planned subdivision under consideration by the Commission.

      (1)    The proposed subdivision is located along an existing public road
and involves no opening, widening, or extension of any street or road;
      (2)    No more than five lots are involved after the original parcel has
been completely subdivided;
      (3)    The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable subdivision
or zoning regulations; and
      (4)    The property has been surveyed and a sketch and legal description
of the property is submitted with the application.
   (b)    Recording. On Commission approval of an application for a minor
subdivision, a conveyance acceptable to the Director of Public Safety and
Service, shall be submitted to him for review. If the conveyance conforms to
the approved application and is otherwise acceptable to the Director of Public
Safety and Service, he shall within seven working days after receipt thereof
certify the approval on the conveyance. Such approval, however, shall be void
after 30 days unless the conveyance has been duly recorded with the Recorder or
an extension has been granted by the Commission.
(Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76.)
1173.02 MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   Application. An application for a proposed major subdivision as
defined in Chapter
1167  shall be submitted to the Commission for approval according to the
following procedures.
        (1)    Sketch plan. Prior to the preparation of a preliminary plan, the
developer shall consult informally with the Commission and City Engineer in
order to familiarize himself with these regulations, applicable zoning and
other codes and plans of the City. At the time of the informal consultation,
the developer shall submit to the Commission a sketch plan specified in Section
1175.02.
       (2)    Preliminary plan. On reaching conclusions, informally, regarding
his general program and objectives, the developer shall prepare a preliminary
plan, including plans, preliminary title report, and specifications of
improvements specified in Section
1169.08 and Chapter
1175.
         A.   Filing. Six copies of the preliminary plan and supplementary
material shall be submitted to the Commission with written application for
approval. The Commission shall review the preliminary plan and other material
for conformity to these regulations applicable, zoning and other codes and
plans of the City. The Director of Public Safety and Service shall inform the
developer as to which public offices must be contacted by him to determine the
nature and extent of the improvements required in Appendix (A) to these
regulations, and obtain a report by the Director of Public Safety and Service
on the preliminary plat which shall be given to the Commission.
         B.   Commission action. The Commission shall approve, disapprove, or
modify the preliminary plan within 30 days after filing, or within such further
time as the developer may agree to. The Commission's action including any
conditions of approval, shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plan.
One copy shall be retained by the Commission, and the other returned to the
developer. Commission approval of a preliminary plan shall not constitute
approval of a subdivision plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of
approval based on the layout of streets, blocks, lots, and improvements shown
on the preliminary plan and the Commission's conditions of approval, if any.
      (3)    Subdivision plat.
         A.   Generally. The subdivision plat shall conform to the preliminary
plan except where changes are agreed to by the Commission. The plat may
constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plan which the
developer proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that such
portion conforms with all requirements of these regulations, applicable zoning,
and other codes and plans of the City.
         B.   Filing. The subdivision plat shall be filed with the Commission
not later than 18 months after the date of approval of the preliminary plan,
otherwise it will be considered void unless an extension is requested by the
developer and granted by the Commission. The subdivision plat shall be
considered officially filed with the Commission after it has been examined by
the Law Director as to form and found by the Director of Public Safety and
Service to be in full compliance with these regulations. The official filing
shall take place at least ten working days prior to the meeting at which it is
to be considered by the Commission. The application shall include six copies of
the subdivision plat specified in Section
1169.08 and Chapter
1175, together with:
            1.    A certificate from the Director of Public Safety and Service
and Board of Health with a report by the City Engineer, that all improvements
required by these regulations have been installed, or that a performance
agreement or bond have been duly filed to secure the construction of such
improvements.
            2.    Cross sections and profiles of streets and all other plans
and construction drawings related to the improvements to be constructed in the
subdivision as required by the Director of Public Safety and Service and Board
of Health.
   (b)    Commission Action. The Commission shall approve or disapprove the
subdivision plat within 30 days after filing, or within such further time as
the developer may agree to. The grounds for disapproval shall be stated on the
record of the Commission.
   (c)    Recording. Commission approval shall be void after 30 days unless the
subdivision plat is duly recorded with the Recorder, or an extension has been
granted by the Commission. The developer shall within 30 days after recording
furnish the Commission with a certified mylar or linen copy of the recorded
plat at no cost to the City.
(Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76)
1173.03 IMPROVEMENTS.
   If the developer wishes to install his improvements before the subdivision
plat is approved by the Commission or is recorded, he shall comply with the
requirements of both the preliminary plan approved by the Commission and the
proposed subdivision plat. Certification by an engineer that the improvements
have been built to plans and specifications which have been filed with and
approved by the Director of Public Safety and Service prior to any
construction, however, shall be required. (Ord. 74-76. Passed 9-13-76.)

3701.21.
      (2)    Where public water supply is not available or not required, the
subdivider shall supply acceptable evidence of the availability of water. The
subdivider may be required to make one or more test wells in the area to be
platted if such evidence is deemed not acceptable. Copies of well logs which
are obtained shall include the name and address of the well driller and shall
be submitted with the plat to the Commission.
   (B)    Individual private wells shall be located at least 25 feet from
property lines; 100 feet from all septic tanks; 100 feet from all tile fields
and other sewage disposal facilities; 40 feet from streams, lakes, ponds, and
ditches; 20 feet from all cast iron sewer lines; and 100 feet from any
vitrified sewer tile lines, and shall not be located within any areas of
flooding. As a precaution against seepage, a watertight seal shall be provided
around the well casing. Minimum lot sizes shall be in accordance with the
requirements of the zoning district in which the subdivision is located. In all
cases where it has been determined that individual water supplies from private
wells are not feasible, a public water distribution system shall be required.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 13    FIRE PROTECTION.
   (A)    Fire hydrants with 2-1/2-inch outlets and one large pumping
connection shall be provided by the subdivider in all subdivisions with public
water supplies. The hydrants should be located between property lines and curbs
with all outlets facing or parallel to the street. Hydrants shall be placed at
the corners of all blocks and at midblock for blocks exceeding 800 feet in
length. Hydrants shall also be required at the entrance and end of all cul-de-
sacs exceeding 400 feet in length.

hydrant shall be approved by the Fire Chief. Water lines serving any hydrant
shall be circulating and shall be not less than six inches in diameter. The
size and location of water lines shall be approved by the Director, the Fire
Chief, and the Ohio Inspection Bureau.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 14    SANITARY SEWER IMPROVEMENTS.
   The following requirements shall govern sanitary sewer improvements:
   (A)    Where an adequate public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably
accessible, in the determination of the Commission, public sanitary sewers
shall be installed to adequately serve all lots, including lateral connections
to the public system. Public sewerage system extensions shall meet the
requirements of the Ohio Department of Health and City standards. Combinations
of sanitary sewers and storm sewers shall be prohibited.
   (B)    Where a public sanitary sewerage system is not reasonably accessible,
the subdivider may provide a central treatment plant for the group, provided
that such central treatment plant is installed in accordance with State and
City Board of Health requirements.
   (C)    Where a public sanitary sewer system is not reasonably accessible and
a central treatment plant for the group is also not feasible, individual on-
site septic tank systems may be utilized upon approval of the City Health
Department and City Planning Commission.
      (1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 15    DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall construct all necessary facilities including
underground pipe, inlets, catch basins, or open drainage ditches, as determined
by the Director of Public Safety and Service, to provide for the adequate
disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of natural drainage
courses. The velocity of flow in an open ditch shall not exceed four feet per
second in soil ditches or six feet per second in turf gutters. Paved gutters
will be required if velocities of flow are greater than those specified or if
it is otherwise likely that destructive erosion will result. Drainage ditches
shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 16    STORM SEWERS AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   Where an adequate public storm sewer is available at the plat boundary, the
subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system and connect with such storm
sewer line. If such a storm sewer system is not accessible, natural drainage
channels with easements of adequate width shall be provided, as determined by
the City Engineer and approved by the Commission. Paved gutters or storm sewers
shall be required if velocities of flow are greater than specified in § 15
above or causes destructive erosion. Storm drainage, including drain tile
around basements, shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer
facility, but shall connect to an adequate drainage outlet. (1993 Code Ch. 155
Appx. A.)
§ 17    OVER-SIZED AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The utilities, pavements, and other land improvements required for the
proposed subdivision shall be designed of over-size or with extensions provided
to serve nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service or
drainage area as determined by the Director of Public Safety and Service.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 18    COST OF OVER-SIZE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall be required to pay for only that part of the
construction costs for the arterial streets, trunk sewers, or water lines which
are serving the proposed subdivision as determined by the Director of Public
Safety and Service. The city shall pay the difference between the cost of
required improvements for the proposed subdivision and improvements required to
service the surrounding areas specified in § 17 above.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 19    EXTENSIONS TO BOUNDARIES.
   The subdivider may be required to extend the necessary improvements to the
boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve adjoining unsubdivided land as
determined by the Commission.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 20    OFF-SITE EXTENSIONS.
   If streets or utilities are available at the boundary of a proposed
subdivision, and if the Commission finds the extensions across undeveloped
areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening
properties or as a municipal expense until some future time. the subdivider may
be required, prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain necessary easements
or rights-of-way and construct and pay for such extensions. Such improvements
shall be available for connections by subdividers of adjoining land.
(1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 21    EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   Effective erosion and sediment controls shall be planned and applied
according to the following principles:
   (A)    The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at anyone time
during development.
   (B)    When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept
to the shortest practical period of time.
   (C)    Temporary vegetation, such as rye grass seeding, or mulching shall be
used to protect high erosion potential or other critical areas exposed during
development.
   (D)    Sediment basins (debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps)
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from
land undergoing development.
   (E)    Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development.
   (F)    The permanent final vegetation cover and storm water management
structures shall be installed as soon as practical.
   (G)    The development plan shall be fitted to the topography and soils so
as to create the least erosion potential.
   (H)    Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.
      (1993 Code Ch. 155 Appx. A.)
§ 22    FINAL INSPECTION.
   On completion of all the improvements, the subdivider shall request, in
writing, a final inspection by the Director of Public Safety and Service as
required under Ohio R.C. 711.091.

1315.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization . Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of City of Coshocton, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Coshocton has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Coshocton, as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of Coshocton.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   City of Coshocton, Community 390089, Panel Numbers 0195, 0215,
0220, 0355 effective March 2, 2010; Flood Insurance Study for Coshocton County,
Ohio and Incorporated Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Coshocton County, Ohio
and incorporated Areas both effective March 2, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Coshocton as required by Section
1315.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Coshocton County Engineer's Office, 23194 CR 621,
Coshocton, Ohio 43812.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Coshocton, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 5-10.

indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 1 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or
approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Coshocton's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Coshocton Flood
Insurance Rate Map, December 18, 1986, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 5-10. Passed 2-8-10.)

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Coshocton flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1315.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1315.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Coshocton, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Coshocton have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Coshocton's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Coshocton boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Coshocton suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Coshocton has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1315.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.
         (Ord. 5-10. Passed 2-8-10.)
1315.04 USE AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.

structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the flood protection elevation. Where flood
protection elevation data are not available the structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the highest
adjacent natural grade.
      (5)   New construction and substantial improvements, including
manufactured homes, that do not have basements and that are elevated to the
flood protection elevation using pilings, columns, posts, or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood
waters may have an enclosure below the lowest floor provided the enclosure
meets the following standards:
         A.   Be used only for the parking of vehicles, building access, or
storage; and

          C.   Have a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total
net area not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area,
and the bottom of all such openings being no higher than one foot above grade.
The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over
the top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of subsection (d) hereof.
      (8)   In AO Zones, new construction and substantial improvement shall
have adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters
around and away from the structure.

hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and,
         C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect,
through the use of a Federal Emergency Management Agency Floodproofing
Certificate, that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
subsection (e)(2)A. and B.
      (3)   Where flood protection elevation data are not available, the
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least
two feet above the highest adjacent natural grade.
   (f)   Accessory Structures. Relief to the elevation or dry floodproofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures containing no more than 600
square feet. Such structures must meet the following standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be constructed of flood resistant materials;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to or above the level of the flood protection
elevation; and
      (6)   They shall meet the opening requirements of subsection (d)(5)C.;

      (3)   They must meet all standards of subsection (d) hereof.
   (h)   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1315.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor, City of Coshocton and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
          A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Coshocton County specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
 1315.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 5-10. Passed 2-8-10.)
 
1315.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Coshocton Zoning Board of Appeal is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these Regulations as established in City Code
Chapter
1109.
      (2)   Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be
held at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson.
All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the
Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings
in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the City of Coshocton Service Director's Office.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a fifty
dollar ($50.00) variance application fee as set by the Council, City of
Coshocton. The fee is payable to the Coshocton County Engineer.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. 1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Coshocton County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 5-10. Passed 2-8-10.)

(1993 Code 153.02)
1321.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Building Inspector” means the officer charged with the administration
and enforcement of the Zoning Code.
   (b)   “Commission” means the Roscoe Village Commission. See Section
1321.01.
   (c)   “Exterior architectural characteristics typical of Roscoe Village
building” means:
      (1)    The architectural character of Roscoe Village, consisting mainly
of two themes, as follows:
         A.   Redbrick masonry buildings, mainly of the era of 1830-1860 and
basically of the late classic revival style, simplified in its midwestern
usage.
         B.   Frame residential buildings, mainly of the era of 1850-1900 and
representative of the unassuming Village victorian of that period.
      (2)    There are a number of intermixes of the above as well as a larger
number of buildings of such modest nature or of such extensive remodeling as to
have effectively lost all architectural importance.
      (3)    It is with reference to the basic architectural character of the
key buildings noted above that the need for compatibility in the future
construction in Roscoe would be made. Compatibility need not infer imitation,
but rather a satisfying response in terms of scale, building materials, and
details. Buildings of subsection (c)(1)A. above are typified by gabled roofs,
wood double hung windows, square headed and in vertical alignment, stone sills
and heads at openings, and wood trim at eaves and doors. Buildings vary in
height up to four stories and occasionally employ stepped gables and walls.
Original roof materials are now gone. Roofing is variously metal, asphalt
shingle, slate, or dark roll roofing. Foundations are commonly of sandstone,
the faces being chisled in light relief. Stone trim elsewhere is finished
smooth. Buildings of subsection (c)(1)B. above are typified by simple
vernacular devices of the carpenter's art of the time, such as turned
balusters, fret work at eaves, scalloped edges on siding and the like. Keeping
to a small scale, these wooden buildings, chiefly houses, have narrow woodsash,
usually square-headed, horizontal siding showing about five inches to the
weather, gabled or tripped roofs, and open porches with slim wooden posts.
Corner boards are generally used. Stone or brick masonry bases are common.
There is practically no use of shutters at sash.
   Because of the rapid changes of grade, stone steps, and retaining walls are
common. Where brick work is used, it is generally laid up in running bond with
headers at each sixth course. Stone pilasters and trim occur in several of the
commercial buildings. Simple flat surfaces predominate, but column capitals may
protrude. Both late classic, Greek Revival, and Romanesque details occur at
sash and door openings.
      (4)    No single style predominates in Roscoe Village, and combined with
the uneven terrain and the variation of building size, a nonregular and
informal character prevails. This is not the case, however, at the corner of
Hill and Whitewoman Streets where a strong degree of conformity exists due to
nearly equal eave lines and roof heights and a consistent use of details and
materials. It is desirable that this urbane feeling be strengthened in this
area, while the more relaxed and varied format be maintained elsewhere.
      (5)    The general character of the streets and walks reinforces the
informal feeling of the site, with variation in setback curb line, walk height,
and the interruption of trees. Spaces between buildings are generally terraced
and green ground cover abounds. Stone and concrete make up most walk area at
this time, although wood boardwalks may have once been in use. It may be
summarized that an irregular, well-foliated landscape prevails and deserves to
so continue while paths, walks and retaining walls remain of masonry and
concrete construction.
   (d)   “Exterior architectural feature” means the architectural treatment and
general arrangement of such portion of the exterior of a structure as is
designed to be exposed to public view, including kind, color, and texture of
the building material of such portion and type of all windows, doors, lights,
signs, and any other fixture appurtenant to such portion.
   (e)   “Structure” means a combination of materials, to form a construction
that is safe and stable; including among others, stadia, gospel and circus
tents, reviewing stands, platforms, stagings, observation towers, radio towers,
billboards, sheds, coal bins, fences and display signs. The term “structure”
shall be construed as if followed by the words “or part thereof.” The
distinction between "structure" and "building" should be noted. “Structure” is
the broader term; “building” is a restricted form of structure. For the purpose
of abatement of nuisances, a “structure” in addition to the above, shall
include buildings, outhouses, barns, scaffolds, ash pits, wagons, auto
trailers, junk, rubbish, excavations, walls, or any object or thing used or
maintained above or below the ground, or any part of such structure. (1993 Code
153.03)
1321.04 LIMITATION ON BUILDING PERMITS.

been issued.
   (c)   Any application to the Building Official for a building permit for any
change in the environment or the exterior of the building shall be forwarded to
the Commission, together with copies of all detailed plans, designs,
elevations, specifications and documents relating thereto, within seven (7)
days after receipt thereof. An application may be filed by the applicant
directly with the Commission at the same time that an application for a
building permit is filed or in lieu of filing for a building permit if no
building permit is required for the proposed change.
   (d)   An application will be approved if it will remedy conditions
imminently dangerous to life, health or property as determined in writing by
the Building Official or the Division of Fire or the Department of Public
Health.
   (e)   Application contents. An application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall contain the following, as applicable:
      (1)   A completed application to the Historic Preservation Commission.
      (2)   A complete detailed description of the proposed alteration,
construction, demolition, removal, or other external change to structures or
site elements.
      (3)   A plot plan, legibly drawn and to scale, indicating all existing
and proposed structures, drives, walks, signs, and other significant features.
      (4)   A description or sample of materials to be used in the proposed
project.
      (5)   Sketches, photographs and other illustrative material relevant to
the proposed project.
      (6)   Any additional information as is deemed necessary to review the
application by the Commission.
   (f)   The application shall be heard at a public Commission meeting. The
applicant, or his representative or agent, is encouraged to be present at the
meeting at which action on the request is to occur.
   (g)   Members of the Commission may inspect construction sites up to the
time of an acceptable form of Substantial Completion Form has been submitted by
the contractor to the owner. During this period any variance from the approved
construction shall be reported to the Building Official, who, if directed, has
the power to stop construction and/or levy fines until the variance is
corrected.
   (h)   In making such a determination, the Commission shall refer to the
below standards and to design guidelines adopted by the Commission.
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that created a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      (8)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (i)   Design Criteria. The following design criteria shall apply to all
buildings, site elements, structures and property designated as Landmarks or
within an Historic District.
      (1)   Traditional building materials such as wood, brick, metal, or stone
shall be used for construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or other
exterior structure or site element change. Modern man-made materials may be
utilized at the discretion of the Commission if the proposed projects keep in
character with the existing building, site, area structures, and any applicable
design guidelines.
      (2)   For new construction and additions, the structure's width, height,
surrounding setbacks and style shall be considered in relationship to adjacent
structures. This relationship between structures shall allow for consistency of
style, size and density in each given neighborhood area.
      (3)   Where possible, elements which can contribute to the quality of the
pedestrian environment and other public amenities should be promoted. Included
among these may be benches, water features, seating areas, arcades, awnings or
canopies.
      (4)   Signage shall be proportionally scaled and appropriately designed
to coalesce with the subject building, site and area.
   (j)   Following its review, the Historic Preservation Commission shall
either:
      (1)   Approve the Certificate of Appropriateness as submitted;
      (2)   Approve the Certificate of Appropriateness subject to specific
conditions; or
      (3)   Deny the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the Commission shall
disapprove the application, they will advise the applicant in writing and the
Building Official in writing withing sixty (60) days after receiving the
application.
   (k)   If no action is taken within sixty (60) days from the date of
application, the Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued as a matter of
law. This provision shall not apply if the application is tabled due to lack of
information provided by the applicant, or due to the applicant requesting that
the application be tabled.
   (l)   A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be conditional upon the
commencement of work within six (6) months of issuance. If the work has not
commenced within six (6) months of issuance or work has not been completed
within one (1) year of issuance, the certificate shall expire and be revoked
pending a request to consider allowing more time for completion.
(Ord. 17-20. Passed 4-13-20.)
1329.08 PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING PROPOSED DEMOLITIONS OF DESIGNATED RESOURCES.
   (a)   In addition to the above procedures, if any applicant for a
certificate of appropriateness seeks approval of demolition, the Commission may
delay determination of the application for a period of one hundred eighty (180)
days upon a finding that the structure is of such importance that alternatives
to demolition may be feasible and should be actively pursued by both the
applicant and the board. In the event that action on an application is delayed
as provided herein, the Commission may take such steps as it deems necessary to
preserve the structure in accordance with the purposes of this ordinance. Such
steps may include but are not limited to, consultation with civic groups,
public agencies, and interested citizens, marketing plans, recommendation for
acquisition of the property by public or private bodies or agencies, and
exploration of the possibility of moving the structure or structures.
   (b)   Before a Certificate of Appropriateness is issued for demolition, the
applicant shall provide information concerning proposed redevelopment of the
site and the Commission shall review such proposal for compliance with the
above standards and any applicable design guidelines.
   (c)   Applications for demolition of a structure shall also include:
      (1)   Current photographic documentation of the structure, inside and
out, showing existing conditions.

alternatives to demolition that have been considered.
      (4)   Architectural plans for proposed new construction on the site, or
reconstruction of the structure, as applicable.
      (5)   Any additional information as deemed necessary to review the
application by the Commission.
         (Ord. 17-20. Passed 4-13-20.)
1329.09 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Neither the owner of nor the person in charge of a structure within a
historic district or of a designated landmark shall permit such structure or
landmark to fall into a state of disrepair which may result in the
deterioration of any exterior appurtenance or architectural feature so as to
produce or tend to produce, in the judgement of the Historic Preservation
Commission, a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole
or the life and character of the landmark or structure in question, including
but not limited to:
      (1)   The deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;

Council, requesting that the City proceed to take action against any owner who,
in the opinion of the Commission, is in violation of this Historic Preservation
Code.
(Ord. 17-20. Passed 4-13-20.)
1329.10 ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   (a)   If preservation of a historic property may result in substantial
economic hardship, the applicant may submit evidence for consideration by the
Historic Preservation Commission. Substantial economic hardship does not
include the applicant's inability to maximize the return on his or her
investment. Deterioration of a historic property due to neglect by its owner
does not create the basis for a finding of substantial economic hardship.
   (b)   The Commission shall consider the following criteria to determine the
existence of substantial economic hardship:
      (1)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial reduction in
the economic value of the property.
      (2)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial economic
burden on the applicant because the applicant cannot reasonably maintain the
property in its current form.
      (3)   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the architectural
standards and guidelines for the property.
      (4)   The owner has been unable to sell the property using best efforts.
   (c)   Documentation of Economic Hardship. To prove economic hardship the
applicant shall submit sufficient information to enable the Commission to make
an accurate assessment of economic conditions affecting the application. In
considering cases of economic hardship, the Commission may solicit expert
testimony or request that the applicant submit any items it needs, including
but not limited to the items below. The level of documentation may vary as
appropriate to each case; however, the Commission's assessment shall be based
solely on the property's economic fundamentals and not the financial capacity
of the owner.
   (d)   Alternative uses and the economic return they will earn in relation to
the following:
      (1)   Estimate the cost of the proposed redevelopment, alteration,
demolition or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be
incurred to comply with the recommendations fo the Commission for changes
necessary for the continued use of the property and the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (2)   A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in
rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any buildings on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation including any existing evidence that
deterioration has progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not
practical;
      (3)   Estimated market value of the property in its current condition;
after completion of the proposed redevelopment, alteration, demolition or
removal; and after changes recommended by the Commission for the renovation of
the existing property for continued use;
      (4)   Testimony from a third party architect, developer, appraiser or
other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic
feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of existing buildings on the property
taking into consideration any existing evidence that deterioration has
progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not practical.
   (e)   The current economic return on the property in relation to the
following:
      (1)   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the
party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the historic
property was purchased;
      (2)   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two (2) years; itemized operating and maintenance
expenses for the previous two (2) years; and depreciation deduction and annual
cash flow after debt service, if any, during the same period;
      (3)   Real estate taxes for the previous two years and assessed value of
the property according to the most recent assessed valuation;
      (4)   All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the
owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of
the property.
   (f)   The property is not to be sold, considered in relation to any listing
of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and offers received, if any,
within the previous two (2) years, including testimony and relevant documents
regarding:
      (1)   Any real estate broker or firm engaged to sell or lease the
property;
      (2)   Reasonableness of the price or rent sought by the applicant;
      (3)   Any advertisements placed for sale or rent of the property;
      (4)   Economic incentives and/or funding available to the applicant
through federal, state, city or private programs.

   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the Executive Secretary of the Board
shall make investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues.
If the Executive Secretary shall determine that there are reasonable grounds to
believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by
methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and
such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during these initial
conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board or its
staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to

order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss the complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.

determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed.

this request shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held
not less than fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and
summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and
the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and
the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
      (2)    The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the
Board in person or by duly authorized representative and may have the
assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence, and
the right to cross-examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and
evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The Executive Secretary
shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall be public and open
to inspection by any person, and upon request by any principal party to the
proceeding, the Board shall furnish the party a copy of the hearing record, if
any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from the unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not after
fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied with the
order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
   (h)   Upon certification to the Law Director for enforcement, the Law
Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name
of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction.
In any such proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a
violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and,
where appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may
also order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.

against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint. (1993 Code 98.08)

communicable tuberculosis, must also undergo TB testing and/or chest X- ray
examination when advised by the Health Commissioner. The Health Commissioner is
also empowered to order examination of any person who, because of symptoms or
otherwise, is suspected of having tuberculosis, and to require re-examination
at intervals by X-ray and bacteriological examination of the sputum or other
discharge. These studies may be made by any physician of the individual’s
choice, or in a tuberculosis hospital diagnostic clinic. In the former event,
X-ray and laboratory reports may be requested for review, if an indication if
present. Re-examination may be directed until five years after an arrested
diagnosis has been made.
      (4)   Reporting of results of all investigations of known or suspected
cases of tuberculosis to the Board of Health shall be mandatory on a private
physician, dispensary, clinic, hospital, asylum, or other public, semipublic or
private institution.
   (b)   Home Isolation.
      (1)   Home visiting by nurses or other personnel of the Board of Health
is hereby authorized in order to determine whether the patient and family are
willing or able to follow necessary procedures in cases of active or suspected
tuberculosis. Any person with communicable tuberculosis may then be forcibly
isolated in the tuberculosis hospital isolation division, if it is established
that any of the following occur:
         A.   Residence in any home or lodging house where housing arrangements
and precautions are such as to endanger the health of other persons.
         B.   Occupancy in any sleeping room with another.
         C.   Contact of any description with children under the age of sixteen
years.
         D.   Attendance at restaurants, public gatherings, entertainments, or
schools, or exposure by the patient in a street, shop, inn, bar, theater or
other public place or public conveyance.
         E.   Failure to cover the mouth when coughing, or improper disposal of
sputum and contaminated tissues as defined by the Board of Health.
         F.   Expectorating on floors, streets, walks, or other public or
private places.
      (2)   The Health Commissioner is hereby given authority to determine
whether a case of communicable tuberculosis is properly isolated in the home.
His decision shall be independent of whether the patient is or is not under the
treatment by a private physician; however, private physician care is
permissible, if the patient adheres closely to the enumerated requirements for
home isolation.
      (3)   Should any of these provisions be broken under direct observation
of a representative of the Board of Health and not through hearsay evidence,
and should the patient be unwilling or unable to correct these infractions,
compulsory admission to, and detention in the isolation unit of a hospital may
then be ordered by the Health Commissioner. Such transfer, under law
enforcement escort if so ordered by the Health Commissioner, shall be to a
hospital designated by the Board of Health and the hospital shall detain the
person for the period of time recommended by the Health Commissioner, however,
the right of petition for discharge from institutional isolation shall, in all
cases, be permitted. Submission of a written request to the Health Commissioner
shall entitle the patient’s authorized representative to a hearing before the
Board of Health.
