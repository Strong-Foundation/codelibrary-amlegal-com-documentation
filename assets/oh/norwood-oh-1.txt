   WHEREAS, the Council of the City of Norwood, Ohio, has had the matter of
recodification and general revision of its ordinances before it for some time;
and
   WHEREAS, the Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter
H. Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification; and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of the ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council; now therefore
   BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Norwood, State of Ohio, that:
   SECTION 1. The revision of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Norwood,
Ohio, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections is hereby approved, adopted and enacted as the
Codified Ordinances of the City of Norwood, Ohio, February 12, 2019.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Norwood as

this Ordinance as a part hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records
of the City of Norwood, Ohio.
   SECTION 2.  The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and immediately
after passage of this Ordinance, and its approval by the Mayor. All ordinances
or parts thereof enacted prior to the passage of this Ordinance which are
inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance except as follows: The enactment of
the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to affect a right or liability
accrued or incurred under any legislative provisions prior to the effective
date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for the enforcement of such
right or liability. Such enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person
from punishment for an act committed in violation of any such legislative

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any document of the Municipality,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor, and subject to the minor misdemeanor penalty described in Section
501.99 of the Codified Ordinances. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs. (Ord. 3-2004.

   The division of Norwood into six wards is hereby amended by the re-
districting of the six wards. The revised ward boundaries have been enacted by
the City of Norwood pursuant to the data generated by the Federal Census. Each
of the six wards of the City of Norwood shall be maintained by the Clerk of

CHAPTER 125
Public Records Policy
125.01   Introduction.
125.02   Public records.
125.03   Record request.
125.04   Costs for public records.
125.05   E-mail.
 
125.01 INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the City of Norwood, Ohio, that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy.
(Ord. 6-08. Passed 2-12-08.)
125.02 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The City, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records as
including the following: Any document, paper, electronic (including, but not
limited to, e-mail), or other format, that is created or received by, or comes
under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of
the office. All records of the City of Norwood, Ohio, are public unless they
are exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the City that, as required by Ohio law, records
will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying.
(Ord. 6-08. Passed 2-12-08.)
125.03 RECORD REQUEST.
   (a)   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response
using the following guidelines:
   (b)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with specificity, and
sufficient clarity to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review
the records. If it is not clear what records are being sought, the records
custodian must contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the
requester in revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
   (c)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office’s general policy that this
information is not to be requested. However, the records custodian may ask for
a written request and may ask for the requester’s identity and/or intended use
of the information requested, if it would benefit the requester by helping the
public office identify, locate or deliver the records being sought.
   (d)   Public records are to be available for inspection from 8:00 a.m. to 5:
00 p.m. Monday through Friday during regular business hours, with the exception
of published holidays. Public records must be made available for inspection
promptly. Copies of public records must be made available within a reasonable
period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of
records requested; the proximity of the location where the records are stored;
and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
   (e)   Routine requests for records should be satisfied immediately if
feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are not limited to, meeting
minutes (both in draft and final form, budgets, salary information, personnel
rosters, etc. If fewer than 20 pages of copies are requested, or if the records
are readily available in an electronic format that can be e-mailed or
downloaded easily, these should be made as quickly as the equipment allows.
   (f)   All requests for public records must be acknowledged in writing by the
public office within three business days following the office’s receipt of the
request. If a request is voluminous or will require research, the
acknowledgment must include the following:
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (g)   Any denial, in part or in whole, of public records requested must
include an explanation, including any applicable legal authority, setting forth
why the request was denied. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released.
(Ord. 6-08. Passed 2-12-08.)
125.04 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of
making copies.
   (b)   The charge for paper copies shall not exceed actual costs as
reasonably determined by the department.
   (c)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc shall not
exceed actual costs as reasonably determined by the department.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of postage and mailing supplies in addition to the
charges set under the costs for public records section.
(Ord. 6-08. Passed 2-12-08.)
125.05 E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office.

(Ord. 60-1973. Passed 6-12-73.)
161.08  OPTIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT PAYOUT PROGRAM.
   (a)    Notwithstanding any other ordinances that may be at variance
herewith, there is hereby established an Optional Retirement Benefit Payout
Program, available to City employees not covered by a labor agreement at the
employee's option and upon the employee's initiative, as follows.
   (b)    Any City employee not covered by a labor agreement may elect to
receive payout of his/her accumulated lump-sum benefits over the two-year or
three-year period immediately preceding his/her retirement, inclusive of the
year of actual retirement, by means of the following procedure and in
accordance with the following terms and conditions:
      (l)    The employee shall submit a Letter of Resignation to the City
Auditor on a form to be provided by the City Auditor upon request. A copy of
the letter shall also be submitted to the City Treasurer, the Director of
Public Service, the Director of Public Safety, the Chair of the Council Finance
Committee and the Law Director. In the letter, the employee shall:
         A.    Provide a definite retirement date (month, day, and year);
         B.    Indicate whether s/he is seeking a two-year or a three-year
payout;
         C.    State the two or three years in which s/he desires to receive
installment payments; and
         D.    State whether the employee desires to receive the payments
preceding the final payment in the form of check or deposit to a Deferred
Compensation Account or combination of the two.
      (2)    The letter shall be received by the City Auditor at least sixty
days prior to the date upon which the employee expects to receive the first
installment of his retirement benefits. (Example - Employee submits a Letter of
Resignation with a resignation date of June 10, 1995 and requests a three-year
payout over 1993, 1994 and 1995. Employee wants to receive his first payment of
December 31, 1993. Auditor shall receive the letter by no later than October
31, 1993.)
      (3)    In order to be eligible to participate in this program, the City
Auditor's records shall reflect that the employee has accumulated the
equivalent of at least one full year of unused benefits. This determination is
to be made as of the day the Letter of Resignation is actually submitted.
      (4)    A final adjustment shall be made by the City Auditor in the final
year of payout, upon the employee's actual separation from service. This
adjustment serves to cover any pay increase or other circumstance that may have
affected the total amount to be paid out.
      (5)    Within thirty days of receipt of the employee's Letter of
Resignation, the City Auditor shall calculate the amount the employee has
accumulated in unused vacation leave, holidays, hourly reduction days (HRDs or
"Kelly Days"), compensatory time, if applicable, to which the employee may be
entitled. The City Auditor shall make a separate calculation which constitutes
two-thirds of the employee's unused sick leave. The City Auditor shall then
submit these itemized figures to the employee and meet with the employee to
establish a specific payout schedule for that employee.
      (6)    Since unused sick leave benefits are payable only to employees
whose separation from service is "under honorable conditions", and this cannot
be determined to a certainty until the employee's actual retirement date,
unused sick leave benefits shall be deemed the last benefit paid. Any employee
electing to participate in this program is required to agree, in writing, to
return any and all benefits paid to him in advance of actual retirement that
are attributed as unused sick leave benefits in the event that the employee
ultimately separates from service under conditions other than "honorable". A
form for this agreement shall be provided by the Auditor. No employee is
eligible to receive retirement benefit payments in advance of his/her actual
retirement unless s/he signs such agreement.
      (7)    The resignation date supplied by the employee in his/her Letter of
Resignation shall be legally binding upon the employee from the time that s/he
accepts the first payment of separation benefits. The employee may not later
renege and refuse to leave employment with the City on the date the employee
has stated in the Letter of Resignation, and his/her position with the City
shall be deemed vacant on such date.

163.01 NECESSITY OF URBAN RENEWAL.
   It is found and determined that:
   (a)   Norwood, like many older Northern American cities, has lost much of
its industrial base and with it jobs, population and revenue. These losses
present unique challenges for redevelopment of former industrial sites and for
the nearby areas which may be impacted by such redevelopments;
   (b)   These changes have also impacted on the delivery of governmental
services resulting from the decreased revenue necessary to pay for the cost of
such services;
   (c)   Partially as a result of the loss of the industrial base and the
problems associated therewith, there exists within the City blighted,
deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this chapter
which constitute a serious problem, injurious to the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the City and its residents and that the existence
of such areas;
      (1)   Contribute substantially and increasingly to the potential for the
spread of crime, for losses by fire and accident; which may necessitate
excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the
preservation of the public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction,
prosecution and punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, and for
the maintenance and delivery of adequate police, fire and accident protection
and for other public services and facilities and various combinations of some
or all of these conditions;
      (2)   Constitute an economic and social liability which may contribute to
the loss of jobs and economic opportunity, discourage redevelopment and retard
the future growth of the City; and
      (3)   Substantially impairs the sound growth of the community, retards
the provision of modern housing accommodations and/or new job creation and
employment opportunities, creates or sustains traffic problems which may be
reduced through new development; and substantially impairs or arrests the
elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities.
   (d)   That such problems are beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and exercise of police power, and can not be dealt with effectively
by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the assistance herein
provided;
   (e)   That the elimination in whole or in part of slum, blighted,
deteriorated and deteriorating areas, and the conservation, rehabilitation and
reconditioning, to the extent feasible, of the salvageable portions thereof by
urban renewal as defined herein, and the economic redevelopment of these areas
to preserve and enhance employment and housing opportunities and the economic
health of the City are public uses and purposes for which public money may be
expended and private property acquired by purchase, by donation and by eminent
domain, are governmental functions of concern to the City, and require the
exercise of the powers of government granted to the City by the provisions of
Article XVIII of the Constitution of the State of Ohio and that the adoption of
this chapter is declared to be a necessity in the public interest and general
welfare of the City of Norwood.
      (Ord. 31-2005. Passed 9-13-05.)

jeopardizes public safety, or is detrimental to the public health, morals or
welfare, and/or
      (2)   A blighted or deteriorated area which is an area within Norwood,
which by reason of the presence of a substantial number of deteriorated or
deteriorating structures; the predominance of defective and inadequate street

roadways, with inadequate turning radii which create difficulty for emergency
vehicles as well as delivery vehicles and are hazardous when large vehicles
must back out onto busy streets; obsolete platting, including undersize lots

163.06 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.

recommendations, including whether or not the plan is in conformity with the
General Plan of the City and including the exercise of its power of approval or
disapproval under Ohio R.C. 713.02, by causing a copy of such plan or plans to
be delivered to the person charged with the preparation and custody of the
record of proceedings of the Planning Commission.
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall submit in writing to Council its
approval of or recommendations concerning such plan or plans. The approval of
the Commission shall also constitute its approval of those matters placed under
its jurisdiction by Ohio R.C. 713.02, except as the recommendations of the
Planning Commission may include a disapproval pursuant to such section. Except
as recommendations or disapprovals are received from the Planning Commission
within thirty-one days after its receipt of such plan or plans, the plan or
plans shall be conclusively presumed to have been approved by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 31-2005. Passed 9-13-05.)
163.07  PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)    Council shall either approve or reject the urban renewal plan or make
modifications in accordance with the recommendations of the City Planning
Commission.
   Before approving or modifying an urban renewal plan. Council shall hold a
public hearing at which an opportunity shall be provided to all persons
interested to be heard, either in person or by counsel, which hearing may be
adjourned from time to time. Notice of the date, time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once a
week for two consecutive weeks, and at least fifteen full days shall elapse
between the second publication and the date set for the public hearing. In
addition, notice shall be sent thirty days before the hearing by ordinary first
class mail to the owners shown on the records of the Auditor of Hamilton
County, Ohio for each parcel within the urban renewal district and by first-
class mail to any occupant listed in one of the following: the R.L. Polk
Directory, the Haines Directory or any similar address directory, for any
address contained in the urban renewal district. Such notices shall also
contain a description of each project area by its location in relation to
highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or artificial boundaries, and
shall also designate the place at which the Plan, together with maps, plats and
other materials describing the project area are and will be available for
public inspection.
   (b)    If as a result of the public hearing, Council desires to modify the
urban renewal plan other than in accordance with such plan approved by or in
accordance with the recommendations of the City Planning Commission, the
modified urban renewal plan shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for
its written approval or recommendations within thirty- one days with the
presumption of approval thereafter, all in accordance with Section
163.06.
   (c)    If Council wishes to approve an urban renewal plan, it shall do so by
an ordinance passed by majority vote, provided, however, that if such plan or
plans, as submitted with such ordinance, have not been approved by the Planning
Commission, or if there were any partial disapprovals by or adverse
recommendations of the Planning Commission under Ohio R.C. 713.02, not accepted
by Council by its modifications of the plan in accordance therewith, then an
affirmative vote of two thirds of the members of Council shall be required to
pass such ordinance.
   The ordinance of Council approving the plan shall be accompanied by, or
incorporate by reference, documents submitted to Council to support findings
made therein and the ordinance shall include the following findings:
      (1)    Specific findings of fact as to the character of the project area
and that such area is a slum, blighted area, deteriorated or deteriorating
area;
      (2)    That the size of the area and the location of elements of blight
and deterioration in the area make it suitable for urban renewal activities;
      (3)    That if the project to be developed under the plan involves the
elimination of current occupied residential housing units, that there are or
will be provided in the project area or are available in other areas not
generally less desirable in regards to public utilities and public and
commercial facilities, at rents and prices within the financial means of the
families displaced from the project area, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings
equal in number to the number of and available to such displaced families and
reasonably accessible to their places of employment.
      (4)    (This finding is made only if Federal aid is needed.) That
financial aid to be provided by the Federal government under its contract is
necessary to enable the project to be undertaken in accordance with the plan;
      (5)    That the plan for the project area will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the locality as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise;
      (6)    That the plan is feasible and conforms to the existing general or
master plan for the overall development of the City as prepared by the Planning
Commission pursuant to Ohio R.C. 713.02;
      (7)    That the plan gives the consideration to the provision of adequate
park and recreational areas and facilities, as may be desirable for
neighborhood improvement with special consideration for the health, safety and
welfare of children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by the
plan;
      (8)    (This finding is to be made only if the project area is not
predominantly residential in character and is not to be redeveloped for
predominantly residential uses.) That the redevelopment of the project area for
predominantly nonresidential uses is necessary for the proper development of
the community.
      (9)    That the urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound need of the community as a whole for the
redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise; provided, if the
project area or a substantial portion thereof consists of open land to be
acquired by the City; such open land shall not be so acquired unless:
         A.    If it is to be developed for residential uses for low or medium
priced private or public housing, Council shall determine that a shortage of
housing of sound standards and design which is decent, safe and sanitary exists
in the City; that the need for housing accommodations has been or will be
increased as the result of the project area; that the conditions of blight in
the project area and the shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing cause or
contribute to an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a
menace to the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and that the
acquisition of the open land for residential uses is an integral part of and
essential to the program of the City; or
         B.   If it is to be developed for nonresidential uses, Council shall
determine that such uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper
growth and development of the City in accordance with sound planning standards
and local community objectives, and that the acquisition of such open land may
require the exercise of governmental action as provided in this chapter because
of difficult or unusual condition of site, deficiencies or ownership, tax
delinquencies, improper certifications, outmoded street patterns, obsolete
platting, deterioration of site, economical disuse, unsuitable topography or
faulty layouts, or the need for correlation of the area with the other areas of
the City by streets and modern traffic facilities, or any combination of such
factors or other conditions which retard development of the area.
      (10)    (This finding is to be made only where an open space land program
is involved.) That the land and the interests in land to be acquired are for
the purpose of preserving such area as open space land and are necessary to
orderly long-range development, to curb urban sprawl and the spread of urban
blight and deterioration, to encourage more economical and desirable urban
development and to provide areas for parks, playgrounds, parkways, conservation
areas, water sheds, and to preserve natural resources, and that the area so to
be acquired is of a size and character appropriate for such purposes.
      (11)   (This finding is to be made only where an educational institution
or a hospital is located in or near the project area and it is desired to
utilize Section 112 of the Housing Act of 1949; as amended.) That, in addition
to the elimination of slums and blight from such area, the undertaking of an
urban renewal project in such area will further promote the public welfare and
the proper development of the community:
         A.   By making land in such area available for disposition, for uses
in accordance with the urban renewal plan, to such educational institution or
hospital for redevelopment in accordance with the use or uses specified in the
urban renewal plan;
         B.   By providing, through the redevelopment of the area in accordance
with the urban renewal plan, a cohesive neighborhood environment compatible
with the functions and needs of such educational institution or hospital; or
         C.   By any combination of the foregoing.
            (Ord. 31-2005. Passed 9-13-05.)
163.08  MODIFICATION OF URBAN RENEWAL PLAN.
   An urban renewal plan and the ordinance approving it may be amended,
modified or changed by ordinance of Council from time to time, before or after
its initial approval thereof, provided, that, if the boundaries of the project
area are extended to include any parcels of land not previously included
therein or if there is added a new type of urban renewal activity which
requires the acquisition of property or if there is a change in the proposed
zoning within the project area or in any other matter directly within the
jurisdiction of the Planning Commission to approve or disapprove under Ohio R
C. 713 02, all of the proceedings provided for in Sections
163.06 and
163.07 shall be carried out in connection with such amendment, modification or
change and provided, that, the plan may not be amended, modified or changed
with respect to any land previously conveyed by the City without the consent of

necessary steps to be taken to acquire the parcels of land in the project area
in accordance with the plan, including but not limited to, the negotiation for
such parcels, obtaining appraisals, title examinations and reports, executing
contracts for any such services, and preparation of appropriate documents to
transfer title to the City; provided, that in the event that appropriation of
property is necessary, Council shall initiate and carry out, with the
appropriate assistance of the several officers, employees, boards and
commissions of the City, the proceedings in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter
719, such acquisition, except where appropriation of property is necessary, may
take place at any time after compliance with Sections
163.06 and
163.07, such actions may take place before or after the execution of any
contracts, if there are to be any, with a federal agency pursuant to Section
163.08 or with a private redeveloper. The City may delay acquisition of
property within the Project Area until the City has a contract with a
redeveloper which provides for the reuse of the property to be acquired.
   (b)    After any necessary appropriations of City moneys and authorization
of expenditures by ordinances of Council in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter
5705, Council action, where appropriate to rezone property, vacate or dedicate

applicable provisions (including the competitive bidding requirements) of Ohio
R.C. 735.05 to 735.09, Chapter 153 and Section 723.52 and 723.53, for such City
activities as may be necessary to carry out the urban renewal project,
including but not limited to the demolition, rehabilitation or repair of
structures (whether voluntarily by the private owners thereof or by the City
for demonstration purposes in limited numbers), the removal of pavement,
sidewalks, lighting and trees, capping, removal and relocation of City-owned
utility lines, grading, construction of site improvements and supporting

   (c)    Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 721.01, 721.03, and 721.28, after its
determination that real property is not needed for any other municipal purpose,
Council may authorize by ordinance the transfer, lease or conveyance of any
real property acquired in accordance with and for the purposes of the plan,
subject to such lawful terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants (including
covenants running with the land) to assist in carrying out the purposes of the
plan. All dispositions of real property shall be at not less than the fair
value thereof determined by Council based upon the proposed new uses and
restrictions thereon to be imposed thereon under the urban renewal plan by
Council through zoning ordinances, private covenant or otherwise. Such
determination shall be made only after obtaining independent appraisals of such
fair value upon the aforesaid basis, which appraisals shall not be binding upon
the City. The manner of disposition shall be prescribed by ordinance, and may
be by negotiation, with or without any competitive bidding, and such
competition and award of a disposition contract may be based on factors other
than price alone. Two weeks publication of notice in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City shall be sufficient notice for the taking of
competitive bids or of the execution of a disposition contract without
competitive bidding. The financial and legal ability of those proposing to
acquire or lease such real property shall be considered in all dispositions.
The Director of Public Services shall execute, on behalf of the City, such
instruments as may be necessary to transfer, lease or convey such real property
in the form approved by the Law Director and authorized by Council, which form
shall include all covenants running with the land, including any portions of
the plan incorporated by reference. The Director of Public Service shall
execute any certificates of completion of improvements or other appropriate
instruments, on behalf of the City, that may be necessary in accordance with
any covenants in such instruments of lease or conveyance.
   (d)    If the owner of property in the project area is willing to make the
use of his property conform to the urban renewal plan and Council finds and
determines that the acquisition of such property by the City will not be
necessary if so conformed, the Mayor, upon Council authorization, may enter
into a conforming agreement upon such terms and security as may be authorized
by Council. Such agreement may provide for the acquisition of property upon
continued failure of the property owner to keep his agreement after notice from
the City specifying such failure.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution
for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all
criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways
located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the defendant to
trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Contempt of court.
171.02   Probation.
171.03   Electronically monitored house arrest.
171.04   Magistrate.
171.05   Forfeiture of driver’s license for failure to comply with Mayor’s/
Magistrate’s order.

171.01 CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)    Summary Punishment. A court, or a judge at chambers, may summarily
punish a person guilty of misbehavior in the presence of or so near the court
or judge as to obstruct the administration of justice.
   (b)    Acts in Contempt. A person guilty of any of the following acts may be
punished for contempt of court:
      (1)    Disobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ, process, order,
rule, judgment or command of a court or an officer thereof;
      (2)    Misbehavior of an officer of the court in the performance of his
or her official duties, or in his or her official transactions;
      (3)    Failure to obey a subpoena duly served, or refusal to be sworn or
to answer as a witness, when lawfully required;
      (4)    The rescue, or attempted rescue, of a person or property held in
the custody of an officer of the court by virtue of an order or process of
court held by him or her;
      (5)    Failure of a person recognized to appear as a witness in a court
to appear in compliance with the terms of his or her recognizance.
   (c)    Hearing. In case of the occurrence of any of the acts enumerated in
subsection (b) hereof, a charge in writing shall be filed with the Clerk of the
court, an entry thereof made upon the journal and an opportunity given to the
accused to be heard, by himself or herself or counsel. This subsection does not
prevent the court from issuing process to bring the accused into court, or from
holding him or her in custody, pending such proceedings.
   (d)    Right of Accused to Bail. In proceeding under subsection (b) hereof,
if the writ is not returnable forthwith, the court may fix the amount of a bond
to be given by the accused, with surety to the satisfaction of the court. Upon
the return of writ, when it is not convenient to hear the charge without delay,
the court shall fix the amount of a bond to be given, with surety to the
satisfaction of the Clerk of the court, for the appearance of the accused to
answer the charge. On the execution of such bond, the accused shall be released
from custody.
   (e)    Trial. Upon the day fixed for the trial in a contempt proceeding, the
court shall investigate the charge and hear any answer or testimony which the
accused makes or offers. The court shall then determine whether or not the
accused is guilty of the contempt charge.
   (f)    Imprisonment Until Order Obeyed. When the contempt consists of the
omission to do an act which the accused yet can perform, he or she may be
imprisoned until he or she performs it.
   (g)    Failure of Party Released on Bail or Own Recognizance to Appear. If a
party released on bail or on his own recognizance under subsection (d) hereof
fails to appear in court on the day named, the court may issue another order of
arrest or order the bond for his or her appearance to be prosecuted, or both.
If the bond is prosecuted, the measure of damages in the action is the extent
of the loss or injury sustained by the aggrieved party by reason of the
misconduct for which the contempt was prosecuted, plus the costs of the
proceeding. Such recovery is for the benefit of the party injured.
   (h)    Judgment Final. The judgment and order of a court or officer thereof
made in cases of contempt may be reviewed on appeal. Appeal proceedings shall
not suspend execution of the order or judgment until the person in contempt
files a bond in the court rendering the judgment, or in the court or before the
officer making the order, payable to the City with sureties to the acceptance
of the Clerk of such court, in an amount fixed by the Mayor thereof,
conditioned that if judgment is rendered against such person, he or she will
abide by and perform the order or judgment.
   (i)   Release of Prisoner Committed for Contempt. When a person is committed
to jail for contempt, the court or judge who made the order may discharge him
or her from imprisonment when it appears that the public interest shall not
suffer thereby.
   (j)    Penalty. Whoever is found guilty of performing any of the acts
enumerated is subsection (b) hereof is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third
degree.
(Ord. 47-1989. Passed 9-12-89.)
171.02  PROBATION.
   (a)    As Alternative to Immediate Imposition of Sentence; Criteria.
      (1)    Alternative. The court may suspend a sentence of imprisonment or
fines or a portion of imprisonment or fines and place an offender on probation
as an alternative to immediate imposition of such sentence.
      (2)    Criteria. In determining whether to suspend such sentence and
place an offender on probation, or whether to otherwise suspend an offender's
sentence, the court shall consider the risk that the offender will commit
another offense and the need for protecting the public from the risk, the
nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history, character and
condition of the offender.
   (b)    Conditions of Probation. When an offender is placed on probation, or
when his sentence otherwise is suspended, the probation or other suspension
shall be at least on condition that, during the period of probation or other
suspension, he shall abide by the law and not leave the state without the
permission of the court or court officer, as defined at subsection (d) hereof.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender and insuring his
good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on the offender,
including, but not limited to, requiring the offender to make restitution for
all or part of the damage that is caused by his offense and for all or part of
the value of the property that is the subject of any theft offense, as defined
at Ohio R.C. 2913.01(K), that the person committed. Compliance with the
additional requirements shall also be a condition of the offender's probation
or other suspension of sentence.
   (c)    Work Release Option; Procedure. The court may, in its discretion,
give an offender the option to serve jail time imposed by the court on the Work
Release Program. Any offender selecting the Work Release Program option shall
be required to sign an Agreement to serve the days owed on Work Release
Program, on a form to be prescribed by the court and a Release of Liability, on
a form to be prescribed by the court. Any offender selecting the Work Release
option shall also be placed on probation for a minimum of one year. A condition
of probation shall be that the offender appear as scheduled for the Work
Release Program and perform the assigned work as required by the court
officers, as defined at subsection (d) hereof. Failure to appear as scheduled
for Work Release Program or failure to perform the assigned work as required by
the court officers shall constitute a probation violation. Any court officer or
supervisor to whom a Work Release participant is assigned shall file an
Affidavit and Complaint in Mayors Court in the event that such offender so
fails to appear or perform work assignments as required.
   (d)    Enforcement Personnel; Definitions. As used in this section, the
following definitions shall apply:
      (1)    "Court officer" means any Clerk of Norwood Mayors Court and any
police personnel assigned to the Bureau of Identification.
      (2)    "Court", when the context so implies, means the Mayor or Vice
Mayor sitting as judge of Norwood Mayors Court.
   Any other employee of the City to whom a Work Release participant is
assigned to perform any task or tasks shall also be competent to file a charge
of probation violation against any Work Release participant so assigned who
fails to perform his/her duties as required.
(Ord. 46-1989. Passed 9-12-89.)
   (e)    Stay to Pay Fines; Procedure. Any court officer may grant a stay to
pay to any offender against whom the court has levied a fine. Any offender who
requests and is granted such a stay to pay shall be placed on probation until
the fine is paid in full as a minimum period of probation. Failure to pay the
fine in full by the time the stay has expired constitutes a probation
violation. The court officer shall file an Affidavit and Complaint in Mayors
Court charging probation violation against any offender who fails to comply
with the terms of his/her stay to pay a fine. Whoever violates this section is
guilty of a probation violation, a misdemeanor of the first degree. (Ord. 92-
1996. Passed 11-26-96.)
   (f)    Ignition Interlock Device; Procedure.
      (l)    When an offender is convicted of a violation of Codified
Ordinances Section
333.01, the court may require, as a condition of probation in addition to any
other conditions of probation, any suspension or revocation of an operator's or
chauffeur's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege, and all other
penalties provided by law or ordinance, that the offender operate only a motor
vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock device that is certified as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.83.
      (2)    When the court requires an offender, as a condition of probation
pursuant to subsection (f)(1) hereof, to operate only a motor vehicle equipped
with an ignition interlock device that is certified as provided in Ohio R.C.
4511.83, the offender shall immediately surrender his operator's or chauffeur's
license or permit to the court. Upon receipt of the offender's operator's or
chauffeur's license or permit, the court shall issue an order authorizing the
offender to operate a motor vehicle equipped with a certified ignition
interlock device, deliver the offender's operator's or chauffeur's license or
permit to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, and include in the abstract of the case
forwarded to the Bureau pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4507.021, the conditions of
probation imposed pursuant to subsection (f)(1) hereof. The court shall give
the offender a copy of its order, and that copy shall be used by the offender
in lieu of an operator's or chauffeur's license or permit until the Bureau
issues a restricted license to the offender.
      (3)    Upon receipt of an offender's operator's or chauffeur's license or
permit pursuant to subsection (f)(2) hereof, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles shall
issue a restricted license to the offender. The restricted license shall be
identical to an operator's license, except that it shall have printed on the
face of the license a statement that the offender is prohibited from operating
a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device that is
certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.83. The Bureau shall deliver the
offender's surrendered operator's or chauffeur's license or permit to the court
upon receipt of a court order requiring it to do so. The offender shall
surrender the restricted license to the court upon receipt of his surrendered
license or permit.
      (4)    An offender who violates a requirement of the court under
subsection (f)(1) hereof may have his operator's or chauffeur's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege suspended as provided in Ohio R.C.
4507.16. Additionally, such violation constitutes a probation violation.
   (g)   Period of Probation. Probation continues for such period as the court
determines, and may be extended. The total period of probation shall not exceed
five years. If the probationer absconds or otherwise absents himself from the
jurisdiction of the court without permission from the court officer or the
court to do so, or if he is confined to any institution for the commission of
any offense whatever, the probation period ceases to run until such time as he
is brought before the court for further action.
   (h)    Procedure Against Probationer When Probation Violation Charged. 
      (1)    Any court officer or other person with first hand knowledge that a
probationer has violated any condition or conditions of his/her probation may
file an Affidavit and Complaint in the Mayor's Court charging such violation.
Such probation violations chargeable by a court officer include, but are not
limited to, any subsequent criminal convictions.
      (2)    If a probationer is required to make restitution as a condition of
his/her probation and the probationer fails to make full restitution by the
deadline imposed by the court, the person to whom restitution is owed and a
court officer may file joint affidavits charging such violation.
      (3)    When an offender on probation is brought before court for
probation violation(s), the court shall immediate inquire into the conduct of
the offender and may terminate the probation and impose any sentence which
might originally have been imposed or continue the probation and impose any
additional or revised conditions of probation on the offender at any time
during the probationary period. When the ends of justice shall be served and
the good conduct of the person so held warrants it, the court may terminate
period of probation. At the end or termination of the period of probation, the
jurisdiction of the court to impose sentence ceases and the defendant shall
thereupon be discharged.
   (i)   Final Order. An order suspending the imposition of sentence and
placing the offender on probation is a final order from which appeal may be
prosecuted.
(Ord. 46-1989. Passed 9-12-89 )
171.03 ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)    Determination of Days. Any or all of the terms of imprisonment
authorized under the ordinances of the City may be served by means of
electronically monitored house arrest, at the sole discretion of the sentencing
Mayor. In such case, the sentencing Mayor shall determine the number of days of
actual imprisonment, the number of days of electronically monitored house
arrest, and whether any of the days of actual imprisonment shall be suspended
on the condition of successful completion of incarceration by electronically
monitored house arrest. The sum of the days of actual imprisonment plus the
days of electronically monitored house arrest shall not exceed the stated
maximum number of days of imprisonment for that particular offense.
   (b)    Agreement Required. No defendant may serve a term of imprisonment by
electronically monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an
appropriate agreement made available to all such defendants, whereby the
defendant agrees to pay the cost of the system (or, in the sole discretion of
the sentencing Mayor, such portion of the cost as he or she can afford to pay)
and agrees to abide by all of the rules and regulations of the electronically
monitored house arrest procedure. The agreement shall provide that no credit
for suspended days of actual incarceration shall be granted unless the
defendant successfully completes all of the days of the electronically
monitored house arrest.
   (c)    Penalty. No person, knowing or having been placed on notice that he
or she is under the restrictions of electronically monitored house arrest,
shall purposely break or attempt to break such detention, or purposely violate
any of the requirements of the detention. Whoever violates this section is
guilty of escape, a misdemeanor of the first degree.

        (a)    Every resident taxpayer, without exception and regardless of
whether or not a tax is due, shall make and file a return, and each tax year
thereafter, such return shall be filed on or before April 15th of each year.
When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the
calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the
fourth month after the close of the fiscal year. For non-resident taxpayers,
the Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the
return of an employer or employers showing the amount of tax deducted by the
employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of a non-resident employee and paid by him or them to the Tax
Commissioner, shall be accepted as the return required of any non-resident
employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is such salary,
wages, commissions or other compensation.
        (b)    The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Tax Commissioner. Such
forms shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from any business, professional, or other
activity, less allowable expenses included in the acquisition of such gross
income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax.
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits.
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, and other
relevant information as the Tax Commissioner may require.
      (4)   Income and expenses attributable to the City of Norwood, clearly
stated.
   (c)   The City of Norwood shall accept a generic form of any return, report,
or document required to be filed if the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the City of
Norwood's prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of the City of Norwood governing the filing of returns, reports or
documents.
        (d)    The Tax Commissioner shall have the authority to extend the time
for filing of the annual return upon request of the taxpayer for a period of
not to exceed six (6) months. The Tax Commissioner may require a tentative
return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by
the date the return is normally due.
      (1)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City of Norwood
tax return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer's request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing a City of Norwood tax return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the City of Norwood tax return as prescribed by ordinance or
rule of this Municipal corporation.
      (4)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
six (6) months from the original due date of such return.
      (5)   The City of Norwood may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         C.   Owes City of Norwood any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of
income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a City of Norwood income
tax return does not extend the last date of payment of the tax; hence, penalty
and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the
rate set out by Section
181.11. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Tax Commissioner shall be granted with the understanding that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (e)   (1)   The Taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided further, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have
been deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06, or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07, or where an income tax creditable against the Norwood Tax pursuant to
Section
181.17 hereof has been paid to another municipality, county or Joint Economic
Development District, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the
amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable
at the time of filing said return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City of
Norwood is entitled under the provisions of this ordinance may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder, or at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be
refunded, provided further that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
181.11,
181.15 and
181.17. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Commissioner or on a generic form provided for in Section
181.05(c). A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment
of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any Federal
Tax liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to the City of Norwood,
such taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to
the income tax of the City of Norwood based upon such final determination of
Federal Tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make
claim for refund of any overpayment.

provided in Section
182.03 of this Chapter and other sections as they may apply. The funds
collected under the provisions of this chapter shall first be disbursed as

year, to the Bond Retirement Fund.

effective for tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2016. Municipal tax

employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.

Municipality of Norwood income tax on tips and gratuities received by the

profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not

           (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Municipality of
Norwood's income tax return. The extended due date of the Municipality of
Norwood's income tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time
to file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Commissioner grants an extension of that date.
                  (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of the Municipality of Norwood's income tax return.
                  (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the Municipality of Norwood
income tax return. If the request is received by the Tax Commissioner on or
before the date the Municipality of Norwood income tax return is due, the Tax
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
           (3)    If the state tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the
date for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08
of the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing
of the Municipality of Norwood's income tax return. The extended due date of
the Municipality of Norwood's income tax return shall be the same as the
extended due date of the state income tax return.
           (4)    If the Tax Commissioner considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality of Norwood, the Tax
Commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
          (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this

if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
           (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality of
Norwood for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall
file with the Municipality of Norwood an annual net profit return under
division (F)(3) of this section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3)
apply.
       (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Commissioner that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Municipality of Norwood income
tax ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with the
Municipality of Norwood for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)
(g)) within the Municipality of Norwood.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the Municipality
of Norwood and does not expect to be subject to the Municipality of Norwood
income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Municipality of Norwood. The affidavit
shall also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to
perform any services within the Municipality of Norwood, make any sales in the
Municipality of Norwood, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the
Municipality of Norwood during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the Municipality of Norwood for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a
taxpayer with the Municipality of Norwood income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Commissioner shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Commissioner possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Commissioner from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Municipality of Norwood by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Municipality of Norwood, unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the Municipality of Norwood and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality of Norwood to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to
the return.
    (L)    The Tax Commissioner shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality of Norwood,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Municipality of Norwood or the Tax Commissioner, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this Chapter and of the Municipality of Norwood's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

Norwood during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for
180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one
hundred eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Commissioner considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Commissioner ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Commissioner shall enter
into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in installments
that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or service
terminates. The Tax Commissioner may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax
Commissioner considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a contract
entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax Commissioner
shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with
those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Commissioner determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality of Norwood before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
            (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1)

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality of Norwood in

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
                 (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with
division (P)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Commissioner shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Commissioner
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

    (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the
Municipality of Norwood's income tax in that taxable year, and if the
affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return
with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a
change in the reporting method is required under federal law. The election
continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the
taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns
under division (S)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from
the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner shall approve such a request for
good cause shown.
           (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

binding upon the Norwood Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality of Norwood income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Commissioner determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Municipality of Norwood. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Municipality of Norwood income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated Municipality of Norwood income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Commissioner to file a separate return
or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality of Norwood
income tax return in the same manner as is required under the United States

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality of Norwood
income tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality of Norwood
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality of Norwood. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality of Norwood. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
            (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having
less than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Municipality of Norwood;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Municipality of
Norwood income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter
on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
 
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality of Norwood income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the Municipality of Norwood
income tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalties, fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the Municipality of
Norwood in accordance with this Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group
of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or
any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Municipality of Norwood before January 1, 2016, to
file a consolidated or combined tax return with the Municipality of Norwood may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

Chapter, may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
           (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least

issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
           (3)    If the Tax Commissioner denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Commissioner shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Municipality of Norwood,
but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Municipality of Norwood as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation
on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Municipality of Norwood is subject to recovery by
the Municipality of Norwood. If the Municipality of Norwood's tax on that
income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality, the Municipality of Norwood shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Municipality of
Norwood claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Municipality of Norwood's tax rate is less than the tax rate
in the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated
using the Municipality of Norwood's tax rate. However, if the Municipality of
Norwood's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the
tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Municipality
of Norwood, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period
of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Municipality of Norwood changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Municipality of Norwood. The amended return shall be
filed on a form required by the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Commissioner before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality of Norwood. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
       (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the Municipality of Norwood's tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Municipality of
Norwood return showing income subject to the Municipality of Norwood income tax
based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional the Municipality of Norwood income tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)

filed, whichever is later; or
                (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
                  (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this
section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Commissioner and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
           (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                   (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Appeals the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Appeals did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
                 (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Appeals becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Appeals, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Appeals is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality of Norwood does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Appeals, of the Ohio board of
tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover the Municipality of Norwood income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
           (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Commissioner shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Commissioner and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Commissioner shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Commissioner shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business hours
and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is unable
to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the proposed
time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable alternative
dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Commissioner, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Commissioner shall prescribe a form by which
a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the taxpayer in
the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax Commissioner.
If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax Commissioner may accept
other evidence, as the Tax Commissioner considers appropriate, that a person is
the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
    (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Commissioner to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Commissioner fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Commissioner, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
           (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Commissioner
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Commissioner can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
           (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Commissioner, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Commissioner may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, theTax Commissioner shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Commissioner is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Commissioner or other the Municipality of Norwood
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Appeals within 60 days after
the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Commissioner
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Commissioner by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Commissioner shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment shall
show the date the Tax Commissioner sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Commissioner as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Commissioner sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Commissioner originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Commissioner originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
           (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Commissioner or other the
Municipality of Norwood official, or the designee of either, with the person.
Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Commissioner or other official from
entering into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file
such an appeal with the Board of Appeals.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Commissioner or the Tax
Commissioner's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality of Norwood that arises pursuant to the Municipality of
Norwood's income tax imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Commissioner from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipality of Norwood:
           (1)    Compromise a claim;
           (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a
claim by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Commissioner's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Municipality
of Norwood as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Commissioner or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
State Tax Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality of Norwood from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 1-2018. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Municipality of Norwood
Chapter or state law to be filed with the Tax Commissioner, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or
amend, or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement,

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

or documents relate, unless the Tax Commissioner, in writing, consents to their
destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession

examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect to
that information shall notify the Tax Commissioner of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)   (a)   If the Tax Commissioner makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Commissioner does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Commissioner from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18 , in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99 .
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Commissioner to provide

be added, as a part of the tax, interest at the rate of two percent (2%) a

this chapter.

taxes imposed hereby shall keep such records or receipts, issuance of
complimentary tickets, and otherwise, together with the ticket stubs, and other
pertinent documents, in such form as the Treasurer may by such regulation
require. Such records and other documents shall be open at any time during
business hours to the inspection of the Treasurer, and shall be preserved for a
period of three years, unless the Treasurer shall in writing consent to their
destruction within that period, or in writing requires that they be kept
longer.
   (c)   The Treasurer may require any person required by this chapter to
collect or to pay the tax hereby imposed to file with the Treasurer a bond
subject to the approval of the City Law Director, with security to the approval
of the City Auditor, and in such amount as the Treasurer may fix, conditioned
for the collection and payment, or the payment of any such taxes due or which
may become due from such person. Such bond when approved by the Treasurer shall
be deposited in the Treasurer’s Office. In lieu of such bond, securities
approved by the Treasurer may be deposited with the Treasurer and shall be kept
as security for the payment of such tax, interest or penalty, or both. The
Treasurer may sell any securities so deposited at public or private sale
without notice to the depositor thereof, if it becomes necessary so to do in
order to recover the amount of such tax, interest or penalty, or both, due or
unpaid. Upon any such sale the surplus, if any, above such amounts so due and
unpaid shall be returned to the depositor of the securities.
   The Treasurer may by such regulations permit any person making a refund of
any payment upon which a tax is collected under this chapter to repay therewith
the amount of the tax collected on such payment, and provide for the crediting
of the amount so repaid against amounts included in any subsequent return.

Treasurer. Licenses for temporary places of amusement or for forms of itinerant
amusement shall expire at the time specified therein. The holder of an

of this chapter in connection with any amusement so conducted upon such
premises, and such taxes shall be a lien upon such premises.
   (h)   When an exemption from the payment of the admission tax is granted by
the Treasurer for a given amusement or series of amusements in accordance with
the provisions of Section
185.03, such exemption shall be considered as the equivalent of the license

date of sale of such business, or retirement therefrom, and the successor in
business shall be required to withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase
money to cover the amount of said taxes so collected and unpaid, together with
interest, if any, until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt
from the Treasurer showing that the taxes have been paid, or a certificate that
no taxes are due.

taxes collected and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the
former owner, together with interest, as provided by this chapter.

(Ord. 27-1994. Passed 9-27-94.)

whom the same was collected, and the Treasurer shall determine that such tax or
penalty, or any portion thereof, was erroneously or illegally collected, and

was collected, the Treasurer shall issue a certificate showing the amount so
erroneously or illegally collected, in duplicate, to the City Auditor, who

187.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively. Other words and phrases shall
have the meanings ascribed to them under Chapter
101 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Norwood.
   (a)   "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five (5) or more rooms are used
for the accommodation of such guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures. The term shall include a motel if the establishment meets the
definition of hotel as contained in this section.
   (b)    "Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess all
or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (c)    "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether
in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any
other capacity. Where the "operator" performs his functions through a managing
agent or any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an "operator" for the purposes of this chapter and shall have
the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall,
however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (d)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deductions therefrom
whatsoever.
   (e)    "Guest" means a person occupying a hotel and paying rent to the
operator.
      (Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    Commencing on June 1, 2011, for the purpose of providing revenue for
the provision of general municipal operations, maintenance, new equipment,
extension and enlargement of municipal services and facilities, and capital
improvements by the City, there is levied a tax of three percent (3%) on all
rents received by a hotel for lodging furnished to guests. This tax shall be
known as the lodging tax.
   (b)    This tax constitutes a debt owed by the guest to the City which is
satisfied only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City, or to the
City. The guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the
rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the
tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the
guest's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is
not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Commissioner may require that
the tax be paid directly to the Tax Commissioner.
(Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.03 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)    Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
constitution or laws of the State of Ohio or the United States;
      (2)    Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions;
      (3)    Upon rents of two dollars ($2.00) a day or less.
   
   (b)   No exemption claimed under subsections (a)(1) or (2) hereof shall be
granted except upon a claim made at the time rent is collected and under
penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by or satisfactory to the Tax
Commissioner. All claims of exemption under subsection (a)(3) hereof shall be
made in the manner prescribed by or satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner.
(Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.04 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for the occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator. The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.05 REGISTRATION.
   Within thirty (30) days after June 1, 2011 or within thirty (30) days after
commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting
lodging to guests shall register the hotel with the Tax Commissioner and obtain
from him or her a lodging registration certificate which shall at all times be
posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. This certificate shall, among
other things, state the following:
   (1)    The name of the operator;
   (2)    The address and business telephone number of the hotel;
   (3)    The date upon which the certificate was issued; and
   (4)    This "Lodging Registration Certificate" signifies that the person
named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Lodging Tax
Ordinance by registering with the Tax Commissioner for the purpose of
collecting from guests the Lodging Tax and remitting such tax to the Tax
Commissioner. This certificate does not constitute a permit."
      (Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.06 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Tax Commissioner, make a return to the
Tax Commissioner, on forms obtainable from him or her, of the total rents
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for occupancies. All
claims for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax
Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner may establish shorter reporting periods for
any certificate holder if he/she deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax and he/she may require further information in the return
if the information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and
payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax
Commissioner. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Tax Commissioner and shall not be released
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Hamilton, or the
City of Norwood for official use only. The nonavailability or failure to obtain
forms shall not relieve an operator from the timely payment of the tax.
   (b)    No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this Chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report, or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing
of any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (c)    If any operator required to file quarterly returns under this chapter
fails, on two (2) consecutive quarters within a twelve (12) month period, to
file the returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any operator
authorized by the Tax Commissioner to file returns at less frequent intervals,
fails on two (2) or more occasions within a twenty-four (24) month period, to
file the returns when due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Tax Commissioner
may require the operator to furnish security in an amount equal to the average
tax liability of the operator for a period of one (1) year, as determined by
the Tax Commissioner from a review of returns or other information pertaining
to the operator, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00). This security may be in the form of an advance tax payment
to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety
bond, satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner, conditioned upon payment of the tax
due with the returns from the operator. This security must be filed within ten
(10) days following the operator's receipt of the notice from the Tax
Commissioner of its requirements. A corporate surety bond filed under this
section shall be returned to the operator if, for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months following the date the bond was filed, the operator has
filed all returns and remitted payment therewith within the time prescribed in
this chapter.
   (d)    If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the
City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make the
filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally criminally liable for the failure. The
dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's
liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax
due. The sum due for this liability may be collected by assessment in the
manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.07 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and previous ten
percent (10%) penalty first imposed in addition to the tax and the penalty
first imposed. An additional penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the total
tax and penalty of the previous thirty (30) day period shall be added for each
successive thirty (30) day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Tax Commissioner determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who
fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate
of one percent (1%) per month on the amount of tax, exclusive of penalties,
from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
   (e)    Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed for the period of the pendency
of any hearing provided for in this chapter, nor for the period of the pendency
of any appeal to the Tax Commissioner provided for in this chapter.
(Ord. 20-2011. Passed 4-26-11.)
187.08 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX, DETERMINATION OF TAX BY TAX
COMMISSIONER.
   (a)    If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and fail to
make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of
the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Commissioner
shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and
information on which to base the estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax

perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the

collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a
guest. However, neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the
amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the guest or
credited to rent subsequently payable by the guest to the operator.
   (c)    A guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once

having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax
Commissioner that the guest has been unable to obtain a refund from the

person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
 331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;

training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;

have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or

citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or

offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

   (h)   Any person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender
under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

exclusively as a street or highway or property used for commercial agricultural
purposes.
   (b)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to establish certain requirements
for Beekeeping within the City, to avoid issues which might otherwise be
associated with Beekeeping in populated areas.
      (2)   Compliance with this section shall not be a defense to a proceeding
alleging that a given Colony constitutes a nuisance, but such compliance may be
offered as evidence of the Beekeeper's efforts to abate any alleged nuisance.
      (3)   Compliance with this section shall not be a defense to a proceeding
alleging that a given Colony violates applicable ordinances regarding public
health, but such compliance may be offered as evidence of the Beekeeper's
compliance with acceptable standards of practice among Beekeepers in the State
of Ohio.
   (c)   Standards of Practice.
      (1)   Each Beekeeper must abide by Ohio Revised Code, including Chapter
909.
      (2)   Each Beekeeper may not opt out of the annual inspection by the
county or state bee inspector as part of the Ohio Department of Agriculture's
inspection program.
      (3)   Each Beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient source of water is
available to the Colony at all times Bees remain active outside of the Hive.
The water source shall be closer to the Hives than a neighboring source where
Bees could become a nuisance such as a pool or pet water bowl. The water source
may be natural such as a pond, stream, or artificial source.
      (4)   Each Beekeeper shall ensure that no wax, comb, or other material
that might encourage robbing by other Bees are left upon the grounds of the
Apiary lot. Such materials once removed from the site shall be handled and
stored in sealed containers, or placed within a building or other insect-proof
container.
      (5)   For each Colony permitted to be maintained under this section,
there may also be maintained one Nuc upon the same Apiary Tract.
      (6)   Each Beekeeper shall maintain all Beekeeping Equipment in good
condition, including keeping the Hives painted if they have been painted but
are peeling or flaking, and securing unused equipment from weather, potential
theft or vandalism and occupancy by swarms. It shall not be a defense to this
section that a Beekeeper's unused equipment atTracted a swarm and that the
Beekeeper is not intentionally keeping Bees.
      (7)   Each Beekeeper should practice best Hive management practices which
includes: replacing queens in Colonies exhibiting defensive behavior,
practicing swarm control measures, and avoiding disturbing Hives when such
disturbance is more likely to cause issues with neighbors or the general
public.
   (d)   Colony Density.
      (1)   Number: No person is permitted to keep more than the following
numbers of Colonies on any Tract within the City, based upon the size or
configuration of the Apiary Tract:
         A.   Up to 7,000 sq ft. = 2 Colonies
         B.   Over 7,000 sq. ft. = 2 Colonies + additional Colony per 3,000 sq.
ft.
Regardless of Tract size, so long as all lots within a radius of at least 200
feet from any Hive, measured from any point on the Hives, remain undeveloped,
there shall be no limit to the number of Colonies. No grandfathering rights
shall accrue under this subsection.
No Hives are permitted on any Tract where the setback requirements cannot be
satisfied regardless of Tract size.
      (2)   Setbacks and Locations: No Colony shall be kept closer than ten
feet from any lot line or within thirty feet of any public sidewalk or roadway.
The front of the Hive shall face away from the property line of the residential
lot closest to the Bee Hive.
      (3)   Flyway Barrier:  Except as otherwise provided in this section, in
each instance where a Colony is kept less than twenty-five feet from a property
line of the lot upon which the Apiary is located, as measured from the nearest
point on the Hive to the property line, the Beekeeper shall establish and
maintain a flyway barrier at least six feet in height.
The flyway barrier may consist of a wall, fence, dense vegetation or a
combination there of such that Bees will fly over rather than through the
material to reach the Colony between the Hives and the adjacent lots. If a
flyway barrier of dense vegetation is used, the initial planting may be four
feet in height, so long as the vegetation normally reaches six feet in height
or higher. The flyway barrier must continue parallel to the Apiary lot line for
ten feet in either direction from the Hive, or contain the Hive or Hives in an
enclosure at least six feet in height. Alternately, locating the Hive eight
feet or more above the ground shall also be considered a suitable barrier. Such
location must be at least twenty feet from any windows, doors or sidewalks on
the adjacent property.
A flyway barrier is not required if the property adjoining the Apiary lot line
(1) is undeveloped, or (2) is zoned agricultural, industrial or is outside of
the City limits, or (3) is a wildlife management area or naturalistic park land
with no horse or foot trails located within twenty-five feet of the Apiary lot
line.
      (4)   Exemption:  The Beekeeper may be exempt from the setback to
adjacent lot lines and requirements for a flyway barrier by obtaining written
permission from the adjacent lot owner(s). The setback to public sidewalks and
roadways may not be waived.
      (5)   Swarms: If the Beekeeper serves the community by removing a swarm
or swarms of Honey Bees from locations where they are not desired, the
Beekeeper shall not be considered in violation the portion of this section
limiting the number of colonies if he temporarily houses the swarm on the
Apiary lot in compliance with the standards of practice set out in this section
for no more than thirty days from the date acquired.
   (e)   Compliance.
      (1)   Upon receipt of credible information that any Colony located within
the City is not being kept in compliance with this section, the Health
Department shall cause an investigation to be conducted. If the investigation
shows that a violation may exist and will continue, the Health Department shall
cause a written notice of hearing to be issued to the Beekeeper, which notice
shall set forth:
         A.   The date, the time and the place that the hearing will be held,
which date shall be not less than thirty days from the date of the notice;
         B.   The violation alleged;
         C.   That the Beekeeper may appear in person or through counsel,
present evidence, cross examine witnesses and request a court reporter, and
         D.   That if Health Department finds that Bees have been kept in
violation of this section, and if the violation is not remediated within the
time allowed, the Bees may be ordered removed and/or destroyed. Notices shall
be given by certified US Mail return receipt requested or personal delivery.
However, if the Beekeeper cannot be located, then notice may be given by
publication in a legal newspaper for the county in which the Apiary property is
located, at least seven days before the hearing.
      (2)   The hearing shall be conducted by the Health Commissioner or his or
her designee. The burden shall be on the City to demonstrate by a preponderance
of evidence that the Colony or Colonies have been kept in violation of this
section. If the Health Commissioner or his or her designee finds a violation,
then he or she may order that the Bees be removed from the City or such other
action as may address the violation, and that the Apiary lot be disqualified
for permitting under this section for a period of two years from the date of
the order, unless the Apiary lot ownership changes, in which case the
prohibition shall terminate.
         If the order has not been complied with within twenty days of the
order, the City may remove or destroy the Bees and charge the Beekeeper with
the cost thereof. Upon destruction of Bees by the City, all equipment shall be
returned by the City to the Beekeeper, with expenses of transportation to be
paid by the Beekeeper. The City's destruction of the Bees shall be by a method
that will not damage or contaminate the equipment, include wax foundation.
      (3)   The decision of the hearing officer may be appealed by the
Beekeeper as provided in the City's rules and procedures. If no provision for
appeal exists, then the Beekeeper may file a notice of appeal with the Health
Department within fifteen days of the date the order is placed in U.S. Mail to
the Beekeeper, or ten days if the decision is announced at the hearing by
Health Commissioner or his or her designee. An appeal shall not stay the Health
Commissioner's or his or her designee's decision, and the Beekeeper shall be
required to comply with such order pending the outcome of the appeal.
      (4)   No hearing and no order shall be required for the destruction of
Honey Bees not residing in a Hive structure that is intended for Beekeeping.
   (f)   Savings Clause. In the event any part of this section or its
application to any person or property is held to be unenforceable for any
reason, the unenforceability thereof will not affect the enforceability and
application of the remainder of this section, which will remain in full force
and effect. (Ord. 7-2020. Passed 2-25-20.)

address of the person to whom the notice was mailed and the date of mailing.
   (d)   Removal by Public Officers. If the owner and, if different, the person
in control of any land mentioned in subsection (b) hereof fails to comply with

may employ the necessary labor to perform the task. The Health Commissioner
shall report all expenses involved in the removal of such litter, including the
cost of service of notice, to Council.
   (e)   Costs as Lien on the Land and Personal Judgment Against Owners and
Persons in Control. When litter has been removed in accordance with subsection
(d) hereof, the cost thereof shall be a lien on such land from the date such
expenses are reported to Council in accordance with such subsection. The Clerk
of Council shall certify such cost to the County Auditor to be placed upon the

offenders from membership and day passes at Norwood Recreational Facilities is
to try to protect the members and guests at all Norwood Recreation Facilities
from any sex-related offenses, by separating registered sex offenders from
members and guests at all Norwood Recreational Facilities. The determinations
and intent to provide information to protect public safety are the same as
those determined, recognized and found by the Ohio General Assembly in Ohio
Revised Code §2950.02, and it is the Council's intent to protect the safety and
general welfare of the people who use and provide all Norwood Recreational
Facilities.
   
   (b)   Memberships of Registered Sex Offenders Denied, or Rescinded, and Day
Passes at Norwood Recreation Facilities Denied to Registered Sex Offenders. Any
membership in the Norwood Recreation Facilities shall be denied, or if already
issued, rescinded, and the membership fee refunded, for any individual who,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2950, has a duty to register in Ohio, and who
appears, or should appear, on the Sex Offender Registry maintained by the Ohio
Attorney General or the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office or the National Sex
Offender Registry. The required application for membership shall include an
inquiry about whether the applicant, or if applying for a two-person or family
membership, any adult family member of the applicant, is an individual
presently required to register as a sex offender. The Norwood Recreation
Department shall examine the membership applications for all individuals
applying for and holding memberships at the Norwood Recreation Facilities to
determine whether such individuals are mandated to register as sex offenders in
the State of Ohio. In such event, the Norwood Recreation Department shall
inform the individual that the membership application is denied or rescinded as
to any family member who is required to register as a sex offender, except
those adjudicated as a sex offender in Juvenile Court, and any prorated fees
for such member's application shall be refunded to any such individual by the
Recreation Department. The Recreation Director or the designee of the
Recreation Director shall adopt reasonable rules to calculate the amount of
refund owed to such individual for any unsued portion of the membership, in the
event that such individual is a member of a family or other multiple individual
membership at the Norwood Recreation Facilities. The term "Norwood Recreation
Facilities", as used in this section shall apply to all Norwood Recreation
Department facilities which are accessed by Norwood Recreation Facilities
Membership Cards. No individual who is banned from membership by this section
shall be presented at Norwood Recreation Facilities which require membership
cards. This ban applies to all individuals who request guest passes to Norwood
Recreation Facilities as well as all individuals who apply for annual or
seasonal memberships. Violation of this restriction by any individual who
appears, or should appear on the Sex Offender Registry maintained by the Ohio
Attorney General or the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office or the National Sex
Offender Registry shall constitute Criminal Trespass, a violation of Codified
Ordinance
 541.05 (Criminal Trespass). (Ord. 9-2023. Passed 2-28-23.)

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or
if the property involved in a violation is an occupied aircraft, criminal

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written

days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the

witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under

request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems

against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such

person complained has not after fifteen calendar days following service of the
Board's order complied with the order the Board will re-certify the matter to
the Law Director for enforcement.

in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the City before a court of competent
jurisdiction.

and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

567.07  BURDEN OF PROOF; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
     (a)    In an action under this section, the City of Norwood shall have the
initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a
violation under that section has occurred.
      
   (b)   The City of Norwood shall be deemed to have failed to have met this
standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that:
      (1)    He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice;
      (2)    He or she has knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 5321.17(C)
and 5321.04(A)(9);
      (3)    He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the Warning or notice of the declaration of the property as a
Chronic Nuisance Property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to
abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance with the
requirements of Ohio R.C. 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9); or
      (4)    For nuisance activities premised upon a criminal charge, that the

         (Ord. 45-2022. Passed 10-11-22.)
567.08  EVICTION OR RETALIATION PROHIBITED
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for a landlord to terminate the lease agreement
or periodic tenancy of any tenant without good cause or otherwise retaliate
against any tenant because that tenant complained to the police or other City
official or employee about nuisance or criminal activities on the landlord's
premises, or the lease premises. It shall be unlawful for a landlord or any
person acting as an agent for the landlord to intimidate or actively discourage
a tenant and/or persons associated with a tenant from contacting the police or
other City official or employee to report nuisance activity associated with a
property. It shall be presumed that any attempt to increase charges, reduce
services, or to otherwise harass or retaliate against the tenant during the
twelve-month period following receipt of the complaint by the police or other
city official or employee constitutes unlawful retaliation under this section.
Such presumption shall be rebutted by the preponderance of evidence that the
actions taken by the landlord were based upon good cause. "Good cause" as used
in this subsection means that a landlord must show good cause for his or her
actions, other than one related to or caused by the operation of this section.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tenant's lease agreement or periodic tenancy
may be terminated for a failure to pay rent; committing nuisance activity;
committing waste upon the premises; violating the terms and conditions of the
lease agreement or periodic tenancy upon expiration of such lease agreement; or
as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 5321. A landlord's failure to renew a lease
agreement or periodic tenancy upon expiration of such lease agreement or
periodic tenancy shall not be deemed a violation of this subsection.
(Ord. 45-2022. Passed 10-11-22.)
567.09  IMPACT FEES AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
     (a)    Once a property has been deemed a Chronic Nuisance Property, the
owner of that property shall be charged an impact fee for the actual cost of
each subsequent service by the City of Norwood for a nuisance or Felony Drug
Offense for that property.
   
   (b)    Once a property has been deemed a Chronic Nuisance Property, the
Safety/Service Director, or his or her designee, shall also assess a civil
penalty against an owner who further violates any provision of this chapter or
fails to obey any order to abate a chronic nuisance. Assessments for nuisance
activities shall be imposed based on the number of nuisance or felony drug
activities that occur on that property after it has been deemed a Chronic
Nuisance Property. The civil fee shall be issued as follows:
            (1)    For the first nuisance or Felony Drug Offense, a civil
penalty against the owner of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be

imposed;
            (5)    For each nuisance or Felony Drug Offense after the fourth, a
civil penalty against the owner of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) shall be

   (c)   If an owner or person in control submits a plan to abate or prevent
further nuisance activities, no impact fees shall be imposed for nuisance
activities or felony drug activities during the period reasonably required to
carry out that plan, if that plan is executed.
   
   (d)    The determination that a premises is a Chronic Nuisance Property
subject to remittance for the cost of enforcement pursuant to this section and
subject to civil penalties or criminal prosecution pursuant to this chapter
shall be effective for a two year period beginning with the date the property
is declared to be a Chronic Nuisance Property. If at any point during that two-
year period, another nuisance activity or Felony Drug Offense occurs at the
property, the two-year period shall restart from the date of that activity. The
two-year period shall restart again for any subsequent nuisance activity or
Felony Drug Offense.
   (e)    In addition to other relief ordered, a court of competent
jurisdiction may authorize the City of Norwood to physically secure the
property against all access, use or occupancy in the event that the owner fails
to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the City of
Norwood is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by
the City of Norwood to physically secure the property shall be paid to the City
of Norwood by the Owner and may be included in the City's money judgment,
including court costs.
  
   (f)    Notice of any impact fee or civil penalty under this Chapter shall be
sent by either priority service with delivery confirmation or certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the owner or person having control of the real
estate at his or her last known address to pay the fee and/or penalty. If
payments are not received by the City within thirty days after mailing of such
notice, the City may collect the cost, including administrative and related
costs, pursuant to Section

a written return to the County Auditor of their action under this Section with
a statement of the impact fees and civil penalties, the fees of the officers
serving such notices and a proper description of the premises. Such amounts,
when allowed, shall be entered upon the tax duplicate and be a lien upon such
lands from and after the date of the entry and be collected as other taxes and
returned to the City. (Ord. 45-2022. Passed 10-11-22.)
567.10  OTHER PENALTIES.
         (a)    Permits, including those for occupancy, health, etc., granted
to the owner may be subject to revocation based on the declaration that a
property is a Chronic Nuisance Property.
   (b)    The declaration of a Chronic Nuisance Property, an order to abate a
nuisance, or the assessment of costs by the City of Norwood on a property do
not affect or limit the City's right or authority to bring a criminal
prosecution or other legal action against any person for violation of the
City's ordinances or the Ohio Revised Code, including those provided for in

chapter.

the class of each vehicle for which a license is desired, the seating capacity,

   The Director of Public Safety shall investigate and hold a hearing as to
each application for license for a taxicab. If the Director finds from such
investigation and hearing that the public convenience and necessity justify the
operation of the vehicle for which the license is desired, that the vehicle is
a safe and fit conveyance and that it complies with all the requirements of
this chapter, he shall notify the City Auditor, who shall issue a license to
the applicant upon payment of the proper license fee and the furnishing of the
bond or insurance required. If the applicant does not comply with the
requirements of this section within sixty days, the finding of the Director
shall be void.
   If the Director finds from such investigation and hearing that the public
conveyance and necessity do not justify the operation of the vehicle for which
the license is desired, he shall forthwith notify the applicant of his
findings.
   All owners of taxicabs hereby licensed or hereafter granted licenses
according to law, shall, at the completion of the year for which they are
licensed, be entitled to have their licenses renewed for each succeeding year
without a finding of convenience and necessity by the Director, provided all
other requirements of this chapter are complied with.

Auditor in such sums as are set out herein, which shall insure the person
operating public vehicles against loss sustained by reason of death of or
injury to persons and for loss for damages to property from the negligence of
such person. If the Auditor finds that any person operating public vehicles has
an excess of assets over liabilities of over one million dollars ($1,000,000),
he shall not require any sureties on a bond filed under the provisions of this
chapter.

obligating the insurer or surety to give the City Auditor at least ten days'
written notice before the cancellation, expiration, lapse or other termination
of such insurance, or the expiration, withdrawal of the surety therefrom or

termination of the insurance or bond, or upon the termination of the liability
of the insurer of surety thereon, in accordance with such notice, unless a new
policy or certificate of liability insurance, or a new indemnity bond, approved
as hereinbefore provided, shall be substituted therefor. Failure to give the

surety for the benefit of persons injured or damaged, as though the policy
continued in full force and effect.

905.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall make any excavations in the surface or pavement of any
street, alley, sidewalk or public way of the City, unless a permit to make the
excavation has been issued in accordance with the regulations contained in this
chapter.
(Ord. 325-1917. Passed 7-16-17.)
905.02 APPLICATION; DEPOSIT; ISSUANCE.
   (a)   Whoever desires to make any excavation in any surface or pavement of
any street, alley, sidewalk or public way of the City, shall file with the
Director of Public Service, on a blank provided therefor, an application for a
permit which application shall state the name of the applicant, the name of the
street, alley, sidewalk or public way of the City, the kind of pavement
thereon, the purpose of the proposed excavation, and the exact size and
location of the proposed excavation, when in the opinion of the Director, the
giving of the exact size and location is practicable.
   (b)   No permit shall be issued in response to this application until a
deposit of money is made with the City Treasurer in the amount as may be deemed
by the Director to be amply sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the
street surface or pavement; these deposits to be credited to the Street
Restoration Fund. This cost shall be determined according to rules to be
prescribed by the Director, and shall be estimated at a certain price per
square yard for each kind of street pavement.
   (c)   Upon the filing of the above application and the presentation of the
receipt of the Treasurer that sufficient funds are on deposit to cover the
estimated cost of restoring the street, alley, sidewalk or public way, as above
specified, the Director may issue a permit to make the excavation described in
the application; the permit to state the name of the applicant, the name of the
street, alley, sidewalk or public way, the kind of pavement thereon, the
purpose of the proposed excavation, and the exact size and location of the
proposed excavation, when in the opinion of the Director the giving of the
exact size and location is practicable. Where, however, the nature of the
proposed work is such as to require a series of excavations, and where, in the
opinion of the Director, it is impossible or impracticable to determine in
advance the exact size and location of contemplated excavations, a permit may
be issued covering the series of excavations for the street, alley, sidewalk or
public way, as may be deemed proper by the Director.
   (d)   In case the applicant desires to excavate more street area than
originally applied for, an additional deposit sufficient to cover costs of
restoring the additional areas shall be paid to the Treasurer. The Director or
his chief engineer is hereby authorized to immediately stop the work until such
increased deposit of money is made.

remove the surface of any street, avenue, alley or other public way, or any
portion thereof, in the City, in, on or upon any street, avenue, alley or other
public way, which shall be built, paved, resurfaced or repaved with any
material other than water bound macadam at any time within a period of five
years after the building, paving resurfacing or repaving of the street or
alley. The Director of Public Service and all other officers and departments of
the City are hereby prohibited from granting any permits for any such openings,
breaks, tearing up, excavation or removal within this period.
   (b)   However, the Director may, on account of any emergency affecting
public health or public welfare, and which could not have been foreseen,
suspend the operation of this five year rule as to any application for a
permit, and in such cases, upon granting of the application, the work may be
performed within the five year period; but the mere failure or neglect of the
applicant, or other person, firm or corporation to lay or have laid mains,
pipes, wires or connections or other means of transportation of utilities
before the five year period, or the inconvenience, by reason of the failure or
neglect, to property along the particular street or way described in the
application shall not be considered to be an emergency.
 
   (c)   Where water mains or water pipes were laid along or to any lot or
piece of property
previous to the beginning of the five year period, and, by reason of unforseen
development, the water mains or service pipes have become, in the opinion of
the Director, of inadequate size, then the Director may suspend the five year
rule for the purpose of and to the extent necessary for the laying of larger
water mains or larger service pipes in any street or other public way. The five
year period shall be deemed to begin at the time of the completion and final
acceptance by the City of any construction, paving, resurfacing or repaving.
   (d)    The provisions of this section and Sections
905.04 to
905.06 shall apply to all streets, avenues, alleys or other public ways, or any

919.01 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Purpose. This chapter provides principles, procedures and fee
schedules for the placement of Structures and Facilities, construction,
excavation, encroachments and work activities within or upon any Public Rights-
of-Way, in order to protect the integrity of the Public Rights-of- Way and to
provide to the City compensation for the administrative costs and
infrastructure costs incurred by the City in maintaining its Public Rights-of-
Way. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require permits for any work
in the Public Rights-of-Way, to establish permit procedures and to fix and
collect fees and charges.
   (b)   Objectives. Public and private uses of public rights of way for
location of Facilities employed in the provision of public services to the
public should, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated;
however, the City must insure that the primary purpose of the Right-of-Way for
the passage of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, is maintained to the greatest
extent possible. In addition, the value of existing public and private
installations, roadways, facilities and properties should be protected.
Competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety must be preserved.
This chapter is intended to strike a balance between the public need for
efficient, safe transportation routes and the use of Public Rights-of-Way for
location of Facilities by public and private entities. It thus has several
objectives:
      (1)   To insure that the public safety is maintained and that public
inconvenience is minimized.
      (2)   To protect the City's infrastructure investment by establishing
repair standards for the pavement, facilities, and property in the public
rights of way, when work is accomplished.
      (3)   To facilitate work within the rights of way through the
standardization of regulations.
      (4)   To maintain an efficient permit process.
      (5)   To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of
the public rights of way held in public trust by the City.
      (6)   To establish a public policy for enabling the City to discharge its
public trust consistent with the rapidly evolving federal and state regulatory
policies, industry competition and technological development.
      (7)   To promote cooperation among the Permittees (as defined herein) and
the City in the occupation of the public rights of way, and work therein, in
order to (i) eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unnecessary or unsightly,
(ii) lower the Permittee’s and the City’s costs of providing services to the
public, and (iii) minimize street cuts.
      (8)   To assure that the City can continue to fairly and responsibly
protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

excavation in the Rights-of-way during the next three years. At such meeting,
to the extent not already in possession of the City, Permittee shall submit
documentation, in a form acceptable to the Service Director, showing the
location of the Permittee’s existing facilities in the City rights of way.
Permittee shall discuss with the Service Director, its excavation master plan,
and identify planned major excavation Work in the City. The Service Director
may make his/her own record on a map, drawing or other documentation, of each
Permittee’s planned major excavation Work in the City. Permittee shall meet
with the Service Director to discuss an initial excavation master plan no later
than sixty (60) days after submitting its first Permit application. Thereafter,

days, provided that the Permittee shall not be required to identify future
major excavations planned to occur more than three (3) years after the date

efforts to inform the Service Director of any substantial changes in the
planned major excavation Work discussed at the annual meeting.

that were resurfaced by the City as well as all streets repaved during the past
five years. For purposes of this Section, the list shall include a landscaping
or other Right-of-Way improvement plan. The list shall be revised and updated
on an annual basis. The Service Director shall make the City’s list available
for public inspection. In addition, after determining the street resurfacing
Work that is proposed for each year, the Service Director shall send a notice
of the proposed Work to all Permittees that have had an annual meeting with the
Service Director. Failure to prepare or deliver an updated list shall not
relieve any Permittee or Applicant from its obligations to cooperate and comply
with these regulations. The Permittee may also be subject to any landscaping
improvements as set out by the City.

the utility and street Work shown on such plan to minimize damage to, and avoid
undue disruption and interference with the public use of such rights of way.
   (e)   In performing location of facilities in the public rights of way in
preparation for construction under a Permit, Permittee shall compile all
information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the public rights
of way related to a particular Permit, and shall make that information
available to the City in a written and verified format acceptable to the
Service Director.
   (f)    Prior to undertaking any Work in the rights of way or related
landscaping, the City may notify all Permittees of the City Work to be
performed. Upon such notification, all Permittees shall, within seven (7) days,
locate their Facilities in the rights of way in which the Work will be
performed, and provide documentation in a format acceptable to the Service
Director of the Permittee’s facilities in that Right-of-Way.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.16 MINIMIZING THE IMPACTS OF WORK IN THE RIGHTS OF WAY.
   (a)   Call Before Digging. Permittees shall be responsible to “ call before
you dig.” (Ohio Utility Protection Service, 1-800-362-2764). The Ohio Revised
Code §3781.28 states that within forty eight (48) hours of receiving notice
under §3781.28 of the Revised Code, each utility shall locate and mark the
approximate location of its underground utility facilities at the excavation
site. If a utility does not mark its underground utility facilities or contact
the excavator within forty eight (48) hours of receiving notice under §3781.28
of the Revised Code, the utility is deemed to have given notice that it does
not have any facilities at the excavation site.
   (b)   Noise, Dust, Debris, Hours of Work. Each Permittee shall conduct Work
in such manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the
general public and occupants of neighboring property. In the performance of the
Work, the Permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce noise, dust, and
unsightly debris as directed by ordinance or as requested by the Service
Director. No Work shall be done between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
nor at any time on Sunday or as directed by ordinance, except with the written
permission of the Service Director, or in case of an emergency.
   (c)   Trash and Construction Materials. Each Permittee shall maintain the
Work site so that:
      (1)   Trash and construction materials are contained so that they are not
blown off of the construction site.
      (2)   Trash is removed from a construction site often enough so that it
does not become a health, fire, or safety hazard.
      (3)   Trash dumpsters and storage or construction trailers are not placed
in the street without specific approval of the Service Director.
   (d)   Deposit of Dirt and Material on Roadways. Each Permittee shall utilize
their best efforts to eliminate the tracking of mud or debris upon any street
or sidewalk. Streets and sidewalks shall be cleaned of mud and debris at the
end of each day. All equipment and trucks tracking mud and debris into the
Right-of-Way shall be cleaned of mud and debris at the end of each day or as
directed by the Service Director.
   (e)   Protection of Trees and Landscaping. Each Permittee shall protect
trees, landscape, and landscape features as required by the City. All
protective measures shall be provided at the expense of the Permittee.
   (f)   Protection of Paved Surfaces From Equipment Damage. Backhoe equipment
outriggers shall be fitted with rubber pads whenever outriggers are placed on
any paved surface. Tracked vehicles that will damage pavement surfaces are not
permitted on paved surface unless specific precautions are taken to protect the
surface. The Permittee will be responsible for any damage caused to the
pavement by the operation of such equipment and, shall repair such surfaces.
Failure to do so will result in the use of the applicant's performance/warranty
guarantee by the City to repair any damage, and, possibly, the requirement of
additional warrantee(s).
   (g)   Protection of Property. Each Permittee shall protect from injury any
adjoining property by providing adequate support and taking other necessary
measures. The Permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all
buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the
Work, and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property
resulting from failure to properly protect and carry out Work in the public
way.
   (h)   Clean-Up. As the Work progresses, all public rights of way and private
property shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess dirt, rock, and
other debris. All clean-up operations shall be done at the expense of the
Permittee.
   (i)   Preservation of Monuments. A Permittee shall not disturb any surface
monuments, property marks or survey hubs and points found on the line of Work
unless approval is obtained from the Service Director. Any monuments, hubs, and
points disturbed will be replaced by a Ohio Registered Land Surveyor at the
Permittee's expense.
   (j)   Parking. Each Permittee shall make provisions for employee and
construction vehicle parking so that neighborhood parking adjacent to a Work
site is not impacted.
   (k)   Walkways. Each Permittee shall maintain an adequate and safe
unobstructed walkway around a construction site or blocked sidewalk.
   (l)   Snow/Ice Removal. Each Permittee shall clear all snow and ice hazards
from public sidewalks at the Work site by noon following a snowfall.
   (m)   Sanitary Facilities. Each Permittee shall provide necessary sanitary
facilities for workers. The location of such facilities shall be approved by
the City in the Permit.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.17 STANDARDS FOR REPAIRS AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Permittee Responsibility. The Permittee shall be fully responsible for
the cost and actual performance of all Work in the public way. The Permittee
shall do all Work in conformance with any and all engineering regulations,
construction specifications, and design standards adopted by the City. These
standards shall apply to all Work in the public way unless otherwise indicated
in the Permit.
  
   (b)    All restoration shall result in a Work site condition equal to or
better than that which existed prior to construction.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.18 RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   If at any time the City requests the Permittee to relocate is
Facilities, in order to allow the City to make any public use of rights of way,
or if at any time it shall become necessary because of a change in the grade or
for any other purpose by reason of the improving, repairing, constructing, or
maintaining of any rights of way, or reason of traffic conditions, public
safety or by reason of installation of any type of structure of public
improvement the City or other public agency or special district, and any
general program for the undergrounding of such facilities, to move or change
the Permittee's Facilities within or adjacent to rights of way in any manner,
either temporarily or permanently, the City shall notify the Permittee, at
least 90 days in advance, except in he case of emergencies, of the City’s
intention to perform or have such Work performed. The Permittee shall
thereupon, at no cost to the City, accomplish the necessary relocation, removal
or change within a reasonable time from the date of the notification, but in no
event later than three working days prior to the date the City intends to
commence its Work or immediately in the case of emergencies.
  
   (b)   Upon the Permittee's failure to accomplish such Work, the City or
other public agencies or special district may perform such Work at the
Permittee's expense and the Permittee shall reimburse the City or other agency
within 30 days after receipt of a written invoice. Following relocation, all
affected property shall be restored to, the condition which existed prior to
construction the Permittee at the Permittee's expense.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section, a Permittee may
request additional time to complete a relocation project. The Service Director

(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.19 ABANDONMENT AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Notification of Abandoned Facilities. Any Permittee that intends to
discontinue use of any Facilities within the public rights of way shall notify
the Service Director in writing of the intent to discontinue use. Such notice
shall describe the Facilities for which the use is to be discontinued, a date
of discontinuance of use, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days
from the date such notice is submitted to the Service Director and the method

Facilities as set forth in the notice, as the same may be modified by the
Service Director, and shall complete such removal and disposal within six
months, unless additional time is requested from and approved by the Service
Director.
   (b)   Conveyance of Facilities. At the discretion of the City, and upon
written notice from the Service Director within thirty (30) days of the notice
of abandonment, the Permittee may abandon the Facilities in place, and shall if
the City so requests convey full title and ownership of such abandoned
Facilities to the City. The consideration for the conveyance is the City’s
permission to abandon the Facilities in place. The Permittee is responsible for
all obligations as owner of the Facilities, or other liabilities associated
therewith, until the conveyance to the City is completed.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.20 REVOCATION OF PERMITS AND STOP WORK ORDERS.
   (a)   Any Permit may be revoked or suspended by the Service Director, after

(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.21 APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   Any decision rendered by the Service Director pursuant to this chapter may
be appealed within thirty (30) days by the Applicant or Permittee to the

(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.22 SEVERABILITY.
   All sections, subsections, provisions and parts of this chapter shall be
severable, and if any section, subsection, provision, or portion of this
chapter is declared or ruled invalid or otherwise invalidated by any court or
agency of valid jurisdiction, such declaration or ruling shall not affect the
validity of any other section, subsection, provision or portion of this
chapter, and all other sections, subsections, provisions and portions of this
chapter shall remain in full force and effect.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.23 CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM.
   This chapter and the terms and conditions of any Certificate of Registration
or Permit shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive
Laws of the State of Ohio and the Laws of the United States of America,
specifically in that order. All Providers and Permittees as a condition for the
grant of any Permit or issuance of any Certificate of Registration agree that
all disputes shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction in Hamilton
County, Ohio.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.24 DISRUPTION COSTS.
   (a)   At the time of Permit application, the Service Director shall
determine the number of days necessary to complete the construction requested
in the Permit application. The determination shall be based upon the R.S. Means
Estimating Standards. There shall be no Permit fee attributable to disruption
costs for construction during the number of days determined by the Service
Director as necessary to complete the work, so long as no lanes of traffic are
obstructed during the rush hours set forth in this chapter. If the project is
not completed during the time period set forth in the Permit, and if the
Service Director has not granted an extension pursuant to this chapter, and/or
if at any time Permittee interferes with any lanes of traffic during rush hour
on collector or arterial streets, without having first received permission to
do so from the Service Director, the following daily fees shall be paid to
compensate for disruption costs:
 
 
Residential Street               
                  $100.00        
                                
                  NON RUSH HOUR RUSH HOUR
Collector Streets  $200.00       $400.00
Arterial Streets   $400.00       $800.00
 
   (b)   The fees for disruption costs shall apply for each 500 feet of Right-
of-Way obstructed. By way of example, if a Permit has been granted for work on
a collector street, and the Service Director has determined that the work will
be completed in four days, no disruption cost Permit fee shall be charged for
work during those four days, so long as no lanes of traffic are interfered with
during rush hours. If, without prior approval of the Service Director, a lane
of traffic on this street is interfered with during rush hours, and the
interference comprises 500 feet or less, an additional fee of $400.00 must be
paid. If the work is not completed within four days, and no extension is
granted, on the fifth day of work, any interference with one lane of traffic of
500 feet or less during a non rush hour time period, will require an additional
permit fee of $200.00. If the area of lane interference exceeds 500 feet, but
is less than 1,000 feet, in this scenario, the non rush hour fee on the fifth
day of work would be $400.00.
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
919.25 ADMINISTRATIVE/MANAGEMENT COSTS.
   The formula for determining that portion of the Permit fee relating to
Administrative/Management Costs is as follows:
(Labor + Indirect Costs) x Number of Inspector Visits to the Work Site = Permit
Fee for Administrative/Management Costs
In connection with this formula the following assumptions are made:
 
Labor = hourly rate + benefits
Inspectors are paid $30.00 per hour
Benefits = 45% of salary ($13.50 per hour)
Average inspections take 30 minutes
Indirect costs = 25% of salary ($7.50 per hour)
HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE INVOLVING PROJECT REQUIRING FIVE INSPECTIONS:
   ($21.75 + $3.75) x 5 = $127.50
(Ord. 14-2002. Passed 1-8-02.)
FEE SCHEDULE
The structure of the recommended permit fees divides the fees into four
separate areas, Review Fees, Degradation Costs, Disruption Costs, and
Administrative/Management Costs. Degradation is defined in Section
919.02(f) Initial Review costs mean those administrative and consultation costs
associated with the review of the Initial Application.. Disruption Costs refer
to the interruption of the normal use of the Public Right-of-Way.
Administrative/Management Costs relate to those costs associated with a Public
Right-of-Way project such as permitting, inspections, as well as inventory, map
updating, and general inquiries related to Public Right-of-Way intrusion. This
fee schedule is not applicable to Vested Users, who shall continue to operate
pursuant to the prior course of dealing with the City.
PROPOSED RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT FEES
I. INITIAL REVIEW FEES
A fee for the Initial Review of all applications shall be $500.00, unless the
applicant certifies that no excavation within the Rights-of-way is intended, in
which case, the Initial Review Fee shall be $250.00.
II. ANNUAL REVIEW FEE
Fee of $250 shall be paid annually by each Permittee to mitigate the costs of
the annual administrative review of status and plans of Permittee.
III. DEGRADATION COSTS
The formula for Degradation Costs is provided in Tables 1 through 3, for
streets with a 20, 30 and 40-year design standard. Table 4 illustrates a
hypothetical calculation.

Depreciation can occur at 1.0% per year after this time for up to 15 years or
street reconstruction, whichever occurs first. This reflects the consensus of
the Committee that streets retain some value beyond their design standard or
expected street life.

APPENDIX A
TRAFFIC CONTROL
   (a)   When it is necessary to obstruct traffic, a traffic control plan shall
be submitted to the City prior to starting construction. No Permit will be
issued until the plan is approved by the Service Director. No Permittee shall

APPENDIX B
GUIDELINES FOR CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
   (a)   Right-of-Way Meetings. Permittee will make reasonable efforts to
attend and participate in meetings of the City, of which the Permittee is made
aware, regarding Right-of-Way issues that may impact its facilities, including,
planning meetings to anticipate joint trenching and boring. Whenever it is
possible and reasonably practicable to joint trench or share bores or cuts,
Permittee shall work with other providers, licensees, Permittees, and
franchisees so as to reduce so far as possible the number of Right-of-Way cuts
within the City and the amount of pedestrian and vehicular traffic that is
obstructed or impeded.
   (b)   Minimal Interference. Work in the Right-of-Way, on other public
property, near public property, or on or near private property shall be done in
a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners and residents. Permittee's facilities shall be
constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with sewers,
water pipes, or any other property of the City, or with any other pipes, wires,
conduits, pedestals, structures, or other Facilities that are located or may
have been laid in the rights of way by, or under, the City’s authority. The
Permittee's Facilities shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to
endanger or interfere with the lives of Persons, or to interfere with new
improvements the City may deem proper to make or to unnecessarily hinder or
obstruct the free use of the rights of way or other public property, and shall
not interfere with the travel and use of public places by the public during the
construction, repair, operation or removal thereof, and shall not obstruct or
impede traffic.
   (c)   Underground Construction and Use of Poles. 
      (1)    When required by general ordinances, resolutions, regulations or
rules of the City or applicable State or federal law, Permittee's Facilities
shall be placed or relocated underground at no cost to the City. Placing
Facilities underground does not preclude the use of essential ground-mounted
appurtenances.
      (2)   Where all Facilities are installed underground at the time of
Permittee’s construction, or when all such Facilities are subsequently placed
underground, all Permittee Facilities shall also be placed underground at no
expense to the City unless funding is generally available for such relocation
to all users of the rights of way. Related equipment, such as pedestals, must
be placed in accordance with the City’s applicable code requirements and rules.
In areas where existing Facilities are aerial, the Permittee may install aerial
Facilities.
      (3)   For above ground Facilities, the Permittee shall utilize existing
poles and conduit wherever possible. No Permit shall be issued for the
construction of new poles or towers in the Rights-of-way without the
determination of the Service Director that existing facilities are not
available or suitable for the applicants needs and that the proposed new above
ground structures are compatible with the immediate area.
      (4)   Should the City desire to place its own Facilities in trenches or
bores opened by the Permittee, the Permittee shall cooperate with the City in
any construction by the Permittee that involves trenching or boring, provided
that the City has first notified the Permittee in some manner that it is
interested in sharing the trenches or bores in the area where the Permittee's
construction is occurring. The Permittee shall allow the City to place its
Facilities in the Permittee's trenches and bores, provided the City incurs any
incremental increase in cost of the trenching and boring. Should the City
desire to install Ducts or Conduit for the possible use of other entities, then
the Permittee shall allow the City to place these Facilities in the Permittee’s
trenches and bores, provided the City shares proportionally in the cost of
trenching and boring. The City shall be responsible for maintaining its
respective Facilities buried in the Permittee's trenches and bores under this
paragraph.
   (d)   Use of Conduits by the City. Unless otherwise restricted by tariff,
the City may install or affix and maintain its own Facilities for City purposes
in or upon any and all of Permittee’s ducts, conduits or equipment in the
rights of way and other public places, at a charge to be negotiated between the
parties (but in no event greater than the best price charged by Permittee to
any other user), to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably
available, and pursuant to all applicable ordinances and codes. For the
purposes of this subsection, "City purposes" includes, but is not limited to,
the use of the structures and installations for City fire, police, traffic,
water, telephone, and/or signal systems.
CONSTRUCTION AND RESTORATION STANDARDS
FOR NEWLY CONSTRUCTED OR OVERLAYED STREETS
No person shall cause an open trench excavation or potholing of utilities in
the pavement of any Public Right-of-Way for a period of three years from the
completion of construction or resurfacing of the street except in compliance
with the provisions of this Section.
   (a)   Application. Any application for a Permit to excavate in a Public
Right-of-Way subject to the requirements of this section shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   A detailed and dimensional engineering plan that identifies and
accurately represents the City rights of way or property that will be impacted
by the proposed excavation, as well as adjacent streets, and the method of
construction.
      (2)   The street width or alley width including curb and gutter over the
total length of each City block that will be impacted by the proposed
excavation.
      (3)   The location, width, length, and depth of the proposed excavation.
      (4)   The total area of existing street or alley pavement in each
individual City block that will be impacted by the proposed excavation.
      (5)   A written statement addressing the criteria for approval.
   (b)   Criteria for Approval. No Permit for excavation in the Right-of-Way of
new streets shall be approved unless the Service Director finds that all of the
following criteria have been met:
      (1)   Boring or jacking without disturbing the pavement is not practical
due to physical characteristics of the street or alley or other utility
conflicts.
      (2)   Alternative utility alignments that do not involve excavating the
street or alley are found to be impracticable.
      (3)   The proposed excavation cannot reasonably be delayed until after
the three- year deferment period has lapsed.
   (c)   Exemptions for Emergency Operations. Emergency maintenance operations
shall be limited to circumstances involving the preservation of life, property,
or the restoration of customer service. Persons with prior authorization from
the City to perform emergency maintenance operations within the public rights
of way, shall be exempted from this section. Any person commencing operations
under the laws of this section shall submit detailed engineering plans,
construction methods and remediation plans no later than three Working days
after initiating the emergency maintenance operation.
   (d)   Exemptions for Non-Emergency Operations. A Permittee may apply to the
Service Director for an exemption under this section when the construction is
necessary in the public interest or to provide a public service. By way of
example, but not by limitation, an exemption could be requested in order to
provide services to a part of the City where no service would be available
without construction. If a non-emergency exemption is granted to disturb a
public way within the three (3) year period, the Service Director may, in his
sole discretion, impose additional restoration requirements, including but not
necessarily limited to, repaving of a larger area, such as an entire block in
which the construction occurs.
   (e)   Construction and Restoration Standards for Newly Constructed or
Overlaid Streets and Alleys. The streets shall be restored and repaired in
accordance with design and construction standards adopted the City and
guaranteed in accordance with Section
919.09 .

provide the necessary sewerage to adequately serve the drainage area. The
notice may be served upon such person by personal delivery, by mail at his last

shall, before making such fill, apply to the Director of Public Service for a
permit authorizing the same to be made, stating in his application the location
of the tract and the nature and the dimensions of the fill proposed. If the
Director is satisfied that the proposed fill will not interfere with adequate
drainage for the area and will not obstruct, damage or interfere with lawfully
existing sewerage or drainage, public or private, or cause a stagnant pond of
water to form, he shall issue a permit authorizing the fill. The permit fee
shall be ten dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   In the event it becomes necessary to adjust, relocate or otherwise
modify the existing sewer systems including any appurtenances, as a result of

obtained a permit from the Director of Public Service for the diverting,
culverting or otherwise enclosing of the natural watercourse, provided always

such structure or diversion ditch. The permit fee shall be five dollars
($5.00).

which the appeal is being taken. Appeals shall be made in writing, within

appeal is filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the application a
stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by restraining order which may
be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record upon
application, on notice to the Chief Building Official or authorized staff
delegate from whom the appeal is taken, on due cause shown.
(Ord. 30-1985. Passed 6-25-85; Ord. 50-2022. Passed 11-8-22.)
1117.18 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owing to special conditions of the property, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code would result in an
unnecessary hardship. The Board’s actions on variance applications shall be
subject to the following limitations:
   (a)   No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in
the same district and no permitted or nonconforming uses of land, structures,
or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a
variance;
   (b)   The Board may not grant a variance which would permit the
establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in the district;
   (c)   No variance shall be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and
until the Board has recorded findings as detailed in Section
1117.20.
      (Ord. 24-2001. Passed 3-13-01.)
1117.19  APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USES AND VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not consider any conditional use or
variance unless and until a written application is submitted to the Building
Department. The application shall be signed by the owner or applicant attesting
to the truth and exactness of all information supplied. At a minimum, the
application shall contain the following information:
      (a)    Name, address, telephone number of applicant;
      (b)    Legal description of property;
      (c)    Description of the existing land-uses, current zoning, and nature
of the conditional use of variance;
      (d)    A statement addressing each of the findings points in Section
1117.20 (Variance) or Section
1117.28 (Conditional Use);
      (e)    A fee as established by Council.
      (f)    A plan of the proposed site showing the location of all buildings,
parking and loading areas, traffic access and traffic circulation, open spaces,
landscaping, refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards and other such
information as the Board may require to determine if the proposed conditional
use or variance meets the intent and requirements of this Zoning Code;
   (g)    For Conditional Uses, a statement evaluating the effect on adjoining
properties; the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes, vibration
on adjoining property and a discussion of the general compatibility with
adjacent and other properties in the district.
      (Ord. 50-2022. Passed 11-8-22.)
1117.20 FINDINGS FOR A VARIANCE.
   No variance to the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code shall be
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless the Board has determined that a
practical difficulty does exist or will result from the literal enforcement of
the Zoning Code. The factors to be considered and weighed by the Board in
determining whether a property owner, seeking an area variance, has proved
practical difficulty include:
   (a)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
   (b)   Whether the variance is substantial;
   (c)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining property would suffer a substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
   (d)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of government
services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage, police, fire, or other);
   (e)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
   (f)   Whether the variance requested arises from a condition which is unique
and which is not ordinarily found in the same zoning district;
   (g)   Whether the variance request arises from a condition which is created
by the Zoning Code and not by an action or actions of the property owner or
applicant;
   (h)   Whether the property owner’s predicament can be obviated by some
method other than a variance;
   (i)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be
observed and substantial justice done by the granting of the variance;
   (j)   Whether the granting of the variance will be contrary to the general
purpose, intent, and objective of the Zoning Code or other adopted Plans of the
City of Norwood.
(Ord. 24-2001. Passed 3-13-01.)
1117.21 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal, variance or conditional use the Board of Zoning
Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
this Zoning Code. Violation of such conditions and safeguards when made a part
of the terms under which the appeal, variance or conditional use is granted
shall be deemed a violation of this Code and punishable under Section
1119.99. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an
appeal or variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
Zoning Code in the district involved, or any use prohibited by the terms of
this Code in such district. (Ord. 50-2022. Passed 11-8-22.)
1117.22 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider conditional uses and variances at
open, public hearings on a regularly scheduled monthly basis. Requests received

supplementary conditions as specified in Section

explosion, flood, earthquake or other act of God to the extent of sixty percent
(60%) or more of its assessed valuation shall thereafter conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Code. Where more than forty percent (40%) of the

replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing provided that the
cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official, unless the strengthening or restoration involves an expenditure
equal to or greater than sixty percent (60%) of the building's assessed value,
in which case the building shall either be demolished or strengthened or
restored in such a way as to be brought into conformity with the use
requirements of this Zoning Code.

(Ord. 30-1985. Passed 6-25-85.)
1153.03  CHANGE IN USE.
   Whenever a building or structure existing prior to the effective date of
this section is changed in use, if the new use does not require more parking

appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals, who shall make their determination on
the same basis.
   (b)   Where there is an adequate public transit system or where for any
other reason parking demand is unusually low, then the parking space provisions
cited above may be reduced proportionately by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon
an appeal from the decision of the Chief Building Official or authorized staff
delegate.
   (c)   Where for any reason, loading demand is unusually low, then the
loading space provisions cited above may be reduced proportionately by the
Board of Zoning Appeals upon an appeal from the decision of the Chief Building
Official or authorized staff delegate.

1155.01 INTENT AND OBJECTIVES.
   It is the intent of this chapter to accommodate creative and imaginative
Planned Unit
Developments and to permit those innovations in land development which are in
the best interest of the City. In order to accomplish this intent, it is the
purpose of this chapter:
   (a)    To permit, in a Planned Unit Development, a variety of architectural
designs, structural techniques and types of structures in a maximum density
permitted within the district in which the Planned Unit Development is proposed
except as provided in Section
1155.05.
   (b)    To permit the flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order to
encourage separation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation, the conservation
of natural amenities of the landscape, the provision of readily accessible open
space, the creation of functional and interesting residential areas and the
provision of a necessary complement of community facilities;
   (c)    To permit, with the approval of the Planning Commission and Council,
commercial uses in residential Planned Unit Developments, even if the
underlying zone is residential only where such uses are intended to benefit
primarily the residents of the Planned Unit Development or where the Planned
Unit Development is larger than two acres in size; and
   (d)    To permit mixed uses (residential/commercial, commercial/industrial,
etc.) where the Planned Unit Development includes more than one underlying
zone.
      (Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   Planned Unit Developments may be established either by a determination of
the Planning Commission and Council that a particular piece of property shall
be developed under this chapter, or by approval of an application from a
property owner. Planned Unit Developments shall be defined as Major or Minor
according to the standards in this section. Section
1155.03 to
1155.16 and
1155.22 to
1155.27 regulate how Major Planned Unit Developments are to be reviewed;
Section
1155.17 to
1155.27 regulate how Minor Planned Unit Developments are to be reviewed.
   (a)   A Planned Unit Development shall be considered Major if it is more
than 2.5 acres in area or where the Planned Unit Development application
includes any of the following: new building(s) covering more than 15% of the
existing site area; demolition of a main structure; significant changes to
existing buildings, landscaping, or other site elements.
   (b)   A Planned Unit Development shall be considered Minor if it is 2.5
acres or less in area and if the Planned Unit Development application consists
only of a change of use of the existing building(s), and/or cosmetic or limited
changes to existing building(s), landscaping, or other site elements, and/or
new building covering less than 15% of the existing site area.
      (Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.03  MAJOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
1155.04 USE REGULATIONS.
   Council may permit the following uses in a Major Planned Unit Development:
   (a)   Any use permitted in the Zoning Code for the particular property which
is the subject of the Planned Unit Development application. A Planned Unit
Development which includes more than a single zoning district within its
boundaries may be approved as a mixed use Planned Unit Development where the
Planning Commission and Council determine that the mix is compatible with the
surrounding uses. Any use may be permitted by the Planning Commission and
Council except those uses first permitted in the M-1 and M-2 Districts,
provided however that in a Planned Unit Development where the underlying zoning
is M-1 or M-2, M-1 and M-2 uses are permitted.
   (b)    In residential Planned Unit Developments, accessory services or
associated uses such as private garages, storage spaces, community facilities
and schools to service the occupants of the Planned Unit Development may also
be permitted as appropriate and clearly incidental to the uses permitted on the
same premises, or such other uses as approved by the Planning Commission and
Council and designed to serve primarily the occupants of the Planned Unit
Development.
   (c)    Open space which may include land, water or a combination of both,
and along with the natural environmental features, swimming pools, tennis
courts, other recreational facilities and complementary structures and
improvements deemed permissible by the Planning Commission and Council. These
facilities are to be used mainly by the occupants of the development in which
the facilities are located and their guests. Streets, parking lots, structures
for habitation or storage and the like shall not be included as part of the
required open space and recreational facilities.
(Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.05  AREA, DENSITY AND LOT REGULATIONS.
   (a)    Area for Development. There shall be no minimum area for a Planned
Unit Development. All land within the development shall be contiguous in that
it shall not be divided into segments by any limited access highway or any
tract of land (other than streets or rights of way for pipelines or electric
transmission lines) not owned by the developer of the Planned Unit Development.
   (b)    Maximum Density. A Planned Unit Development shall not exceed the
densities prescribed for the district in which it is located except that in
residential Planned Unit Developments consisting of two or more acres the
density may be increased twenty percent (20%) above that permitted by the
zoning. Permitted density shall be determined by the average number of units
per acre, as determined by the minimum lot sizes in the respective districts.
   (c)    Minimum Requirements.
      (1)   Yard setback, height controls, type of dwelling unit, frontage, use
and parking restrictions contained in other chapters of this Zoning Code are
hereby waived for Planned Unit Developments, provided that the intent and
objectives of this chapter are implemented in the total development plan, as
determined by the Planning Commission and Council. Building separation shall be
maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Fire Code and other
safety codes of the City and the State.
      (2)   Every building shall have access to a public street, internal
walkway, internal street or other area dedicated to common use.
   (d)    Perimeter Requirements. If topographical or other barriers within the
development
do not provide reasonable privacy for the existing uses adjacent to the
development, the Planning
Commission and Council shall impose either of the following requirements, or
both:
      (1)    Structures located on the perimeter of the development shall be
set back in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code controlling the
area within which the development is situated; and
      (2)    Structures located on the perimeter shall be well screened in a
manner approved by the Planning Commission and Council.
         (Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.06 STREETS.
   (a)    Interior public streets shall be paved according to the City's street
design standards. Interior private streets shall be properly lighted and
maintained. The minimum paved roadway for private streets in a residential
Planned Unit Development shall be as follows: two-way road without parking,
twenty-four feet; two-way road with parking on one side where approved, thirty
feet; one-way road with parking on one side where approved, twenty feet; and
one-way road without parking, eighteen feet. Parking along access roads shall
be subject to the approval of Council and the Service Director. In business or
industrial Planned Unit Developments, the above minimum right of-way widths
shall be increased in accordance with the requirements of Council.
   (b)   Collector streets and major thoroughfares shall be designated as such
by the developer upon submission of the general plans as provided for
hereafter. Such designations shall be subject to modification by the Planning
Commission and Council so that an efficient circulation system is established
in relation to other existing or planned streets in the area.
   (c)    Off-street parking shall be provided outside the public or private
right of way sufficient to accommodate the normal uses of any structure
consistent with the requirements of Chapter
1153, and those persons who live or are employed on the premises as well as
their social or business invitees. Screening of parking or service areas may be
required through the use of such devices as are determined by the Planning
Commission and Council. All parking spaces and service drives shall be improved
with bituminous, concrete or equivalent pavement materials and so graded and
drained as to control the release of all surface water accumulation within the
area.
(Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.07 SIGNAGE.
   Signage for commercial uses within Major Planned Unit Developments shall be
considered according to subsections (a) to (c), inclusive. These sign area
limitations supercede and replace Chapter
1321 of the Norwood Zoning Code for Major Planned Unit Developments only.
   (a)    Total signage area for the Planned Unit Development shall be the sum
of allowable signage area calculated from the base rate of two square feet of
sign area per linear foot of building frontage.
   (b)    Surface signs are recommended. Other sign types are permitted as
follows, with reductions in sign area.
      (1)    The sign area for ground [monument] signs shall be reduced by one-
third of the standard allowable area.
      (2)    The sign area for pole signs with a total height of 15 feet or
less shall be reduced by one-half of the standard allowable area. Sign area for
pole signs with a total height over 15 feet shall be further reduced by one-
quarter for each additional 3 feet height.
      (3)    Sign area for all other non-surface signs shall be reduced by one-
half.
   (c)    Bonuses in signage area are calculated from the base size set by the
reductions taken in (b) and are permitted as follows, up to an overall maximum
of three square feet of sign area per linear foot of building frontage:
      (1)    Use of natural materials or sandblasted resin for the sign face
shall be permitted a bonus of one-quarter additional signage area.
      (2)    Use of uniform font face and size shall be permitted a bonus of
one-quarter additional signage area.
      (3)    Use of three or fewer colors (black and white included in the
three) shall be permitted a bonus of one-quarter additional signage area.
      (4)    Signs which are not lit shall be permitted a bonus of one-third
additional signage area.
      (5)    Ground or pole signs which are placed more than 5 feet off the
property line shall be permitted a bonus of one-eighth additional area for each
additional 4 feet of setback.
         (Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.08 COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)    Amount and Character. With respect to residential Planned Unit
Developments, at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total land of the
proposed development permitted by this section shall be dedicated to public or
private open space (or a combination of public and private open space) or
recreational facilities exclusive of dwellings, streets, parking areas and
single- family residential lots. With respect to nonresidential Planned Unit
Developments, the amount of open space that is required shall be determined by
the Planning Commission and Council and shall be a function of the nature of
the development and the avoidance of adverse impacts or blighting influences
upon neighboring uses. Such open space shall be clearly shown on the
Preliminary and Final Plans, and shall be physically situated so as to be
readily accessible, available to and useful to all occupants of the Planned
Unit Development.
   (b)    Conveyance and Maintenance of Common Open Space. All common open
space shown on the Prelininary and Final Plans and recorded with the County
Recorder shall be conveyed in accordance with one of the following methods:
      (1)    By dedication to the City as publicly owned and maintained open
space. All common open space for dedication to the City shall be acceptable to
the Planning Commission and Council with regard to size, shape, location and
improvement. In addition, the developer shall show that the dedication of such
areas will be for the benefit of the general public of the City.
      (2)    By leasing or conveying title (including beneficial ownership) to
a corporation, occupants' association, trust or other legal entity. In the
terms of such lease or other instrument of conveyance, provisions shall be
included which are suitable to the Planning Commission and Council for
guaranteeing: the continued use of such land for intended purposes; continuity
of property maintenance; when appropriate, the availability of funds required
for such maintenance; adequate insurance protection; and recovery for loss
sustained by casualty, condemnation or otherwise.
In any event, the developer shall file with the County Recorder at the time the
approved final development plan is filed, legal documents which shall produce
the aforesaid guarantees and, in particular, shall provide a method for
restricting use of common open space for designated purposes.
         (Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.09 PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION.
   The pedestrian circulation system and its related walkways shall be
insulated as completely and as reasonably as possible from the vehicular street
system in order to provide separation of pedestrian and vehicular movement.
(Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.10 UTILITIES.
   The Planning Commission and Council shall have the authority to require the
provision of underground installation of utilities (including electricity and
telephone) in both public and private ways. Utility installation and
maintenance of facilities shall be in accordance with City requirements and
regulations. A Planned Unit Development shall not be approved unless adequate
assurance is given that adequate public or central water and sanitary sewers
shall be avaiIable at the first occupancy.
(Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.11  PRIVACY IN RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   Each residential Planned Unit Development shall provide reasonable visual
and accoustical privacy so that the occupants of one unit shall not interfere
with the activities of occupants of another unit. Fences, insulation, walls,
barriers and landscaping shall be used as appropriate, for the protection and
aesthetic enhancement of property, the privacy of its occupants, screening of
objectionable views or uses and the reduction of noises.
(Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.12 WAIVER OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The Planning Commission and Council shall have the authority to waive the
requirements of this chapter upon request by a property owner of property in a
Planned Unit Development District if the property owner desires to use the
property under the underlying district regulations and if the Planning
Commission and Council determines that the use proposed by the property owner
meets the following standards:
   (a)    Shall be harmonious and in accordance with the general objectives of
the City's comprehensive plan and/or the Zoning Code;
   (b)    Shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use shall not change the
essential character of the same area;
   (c)    Shall not be hazardous or disturbing to neighboring uses;
   (d)    Shall be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage,
refuse disposal, water and sewers, schools or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to
adequately provide any such services;
   (e)    Shall not create additional requirements of public cost for public
facilities and public services and shall not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
   (f)    Shall not involve uses, activities, processes, material, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors. (Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)
1155.13 PRELIMINARY PLAN SUBMISSION.
   (a)   At the time of application for approval of a Planned Unit Development,
a Preliminary Plan for the development of the land shall be filed with the
Planning Commission by the owner or owners of the land involved. The
Preliminary Plan (which may be set forth on one or more maps or in one or more
instruments) shall have been signed by all of the owners of the property within
the project, shall have been drawn to scale, and shall have been prepared by an
architect, landscape architect, civil engineer or urban or regional planner.

of compliance with Section
1155.05.
      (5)    A detailed landscaping plan for all areas.

recommendation to Council. The Planning Commission shall have thirty days from
the date on which the Final Plan is filed to consider and report upon an
application for approval of a Final Plan. The time may be extended by mutual
consent of the developer and the Planning Commission. Council shall consider
the report from the Planning Commission and shall have sixty days from the date
on which it receives the report from the Planning Commission to consider and to
approve, deny or approve with modifications the Final Plan, provided that time
may be extended by mutual consent of the developer and the City. Council shall
approve the application if it finds that the following conditions are met:
      (1)    The Final Plan accurately sets forth the area to be developed, the
area to be set aside as open space with appropriate boundaries established by
courses and distances, the quantity of land within the area to be approved and
the quantity of land to be set aside as open space for the use of all occupants
of the area;
      (2)    The Final Plan is substantially in accordance with the Preliminary
Plan which has been previously filed with the Planning Commission and approved
by Council;
      (3)    The density of dwelling units in any area does not exceed that
shown on the Preliminary Plan;

proportionate development of the open space and recreational facilities in
conjunction with the total project. A performance bond may be allowed to
substitute for actual construction of recreational facilities. Any such
construction covered by a performance bond shall be completed within one year.
The amenities included in each phase shall be, in effect, completed prior to
the issuance of occupancy permits.
(Ord. 9-2003. Passed 2-25-03.)

common recreational facilities shown on the recorded Final Plan and the
construction of other nonresidential structures shall proceed substantially in
accordance with the phasing program referred to in Section
1155.13, Preliminary Plan submission, herein. After general construction
commences, the developer shall submit progress reports every six months to the
Planning Commission, which shall review all building permits issued and compare
them to the overall development phasing program. If it is determined that the
rate of construction of units substantially differs from the phasing program,
the Planning Commission shall notify the developer in writing. Thereafter, the

1157.01  PURPOSE.
   Bed and breakfast inns are unique semi-commercial operations that adapt a
residential environment into a lodging concept limited in scope and operation.
The regulations presented here provide a systematic set of requirements to
ensure that such operations, if appropriate for a residential or commercial
area, shall not adversely impact adjacent uses as a result of the commercial
aspects of the structure and property. Bed and breakfast inns shall be
subordinate to the principal use of a single family dwelling. The intent is not
to provide an opportunity for the establishment of an intensive commercial
lodging business which would be considered appropriate within an intensive
commercial or planned commercial zoning district.
(Ord. 29-1993. Passed 10-12-93.)
1157.02  DEFINITION; SUBORDINATE USE REQUIREMENT.
   For the purposes of this Zoning Code, a "bed and breakfast inn" means an

1157.04.
(Ord. 29-1993. Passed 10-12-93.)
1157.03  CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A bed and breakfast inn is classified as a conditional use in those zoning
districts where noted in this Zoning Code. The corresponding standards and
requirements of Chapter
1117 thereby apply. Such conditional use permit shall be voided upon the sale
or transfer of the property ownership. In submitting an application for
conditional use permit, the applicant shall provide to the Board of Zoning
Appeals a floor plan illustrating the proposed operation, a site plan
indicating all on-site improvements, and any additional information as may be
required by the Board.
(Ord. 29-1993. Passed 10-12-93.)
1157.04  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   The following development standards apply to bed and breakfast inns that are
conditional uses within the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts.
   (a)    Guest Rooms. There shall be a maximum of three guest rooms within a
single family dwelling that are utilized by bed and breakfast guests. A guest
room shall contain not less than 100 square feet of living space, not including
closets, for two guests and thirty square feet for each additional guest up to
a total of four guests per room.
   (b)    Parking. One off-street parking space shall be provided for each
guest room and one off-street parking space for the dwelling unit. Such off-
street parking spaces may be provided in an existing driveway.
   (c)    Signage. One on-premises sign shall be permitted for each bed and
breakfast inn not to exceed four square feet in area. The sign shall not be
internally illuminated. Such signs shall be limited to three colors. The
applicable standards of Chapter
1321 of the Codified Ordinances shall apply unless otherwise superseded by this
section.
   (d)    Employees. No individuals who are nonresidents of the dwelling may be
employed in the operation of a bed and breakfast inn. (Ord. 29-1993. Passed 10-
12-93.)
1157.05  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Single Family Detached Dwelling. Bed and breakfast inns shall only be
permitted with a conditional use permit in single family detached dwellings.
   (b)    Owner/Operator. The owner/operator of the bed and breakfast shall
live full-time on the inn's premises. Such owner/operator shall be the record
owner of not less than fifty percent (50%) interest of the property in
question.
   (c)    Design Review. All new construction and exterior alterations
associated with the bed and breakfast inn, including nonstructural
improvements, shall be reviewed by and require the approval of the Board of
Zoning Appeals prior to its consideration of the conditional use permit. All
such improvements shall be completed prior to issuance of an occupancy permit.
   (d)    Certificate of Fire and Health Officers. Certificates from Fire and
Health Departments shall be required for each conditional use permit requesting
approval for a bed and breakfast inn. Each guest room shall contain a separate
installed smoke detector alarm approved by the Bureau of Fire Safety. No
premises shall be utilized for a bed and breakfast inn unless there are at
least two separate exits to the outdoors.
   (e)   Meals. Only one meal shall be served to each guest of the bed and
breakfast inn and that meal shall be breakfast. The sale and consumption of
alcoholic beverages to paying guests is prohibited in a bed and breakfast inn.
   (f)   Consecutive Nights. Each paying guest may stay at a bed and breakfast
inn for not more than seven consecutive nights at any single visit nor more
than a total of fourteen nights in any given calendar year.
   (g)   Kitchen Facilities. Only one kitchen facility shall be permitted per
structure for which a conditional use permit is granted to operate a bed and
breakfast inn. No cooking facilities shall be permitted in individual guest
quarters.
   (h)    Bathrooms. A minimum of one full bathroom, including shower and/or
bath, toilet and sink, shall be required for every two guest rooms to be
available for the exclusive use of bed and breakfast paying guests. Bed and
breakfast inns shall be serviced by public sanitary sewer and water service.
   (i)    Guest Register. A guest register listing the name, address and phone
number of all paying guests shall be maintained by the owner/manager and shall
be made available for inspection by City officials.

adjacent to any such residential district, rental of a bed and breakfast inn
for special gatherings such as wedding receptions and parties shall be
permitted only with the prior approval of the Director of Public Safety. The
Director may refuse to approve such event if, in the Director's judgment, the
event is detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the community. Such
events shall not exceed three per year.

(Ord. 73-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1301.05 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of the Norwood Building Code (NBC) are as follows:
   (a)    General. To provide uniform standards and requirements for the
erection, construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings and
other structures including construction of industrialized units. Such standards
shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings
for their intended use and occupancy.

so far as is practicable, in terms of performance objectives, so as to make
adequate performance for the use intended the test of acceptability.
   (c)    Technological Development. To permit to the fullest extent feasible,
the use of materials and technical methods, devices and improvements, including
the use of industrialized units which tend to reduce the cost of construction
and erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units, and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction.
   (d)   Standardization of Construction. To encourage, so far as may be
practicable, the standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment,
material and techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized

      (Ord. 73-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1301.06  LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.
   The Norwood Building Code (NBC) and all proceedings thereunder shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purposes under Section
1301.05 and to avoid unnecessary hardship, provided the spirit and intent of
the NBC shall be observed and the public safety, health and welfare is assured.
(Ord. 73-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1301.07 CONFLICT BETWEEN SPECIAL AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.

for which the building or structure is to be used, its location, and the name
and address of the architect, engineer, or other person by whom the plans and
specifications were prepared.
      (2)    An index of drawings located on the first sheet.
      (3)    A plot plan for the construction of a new principal building and
in all other cases where the Building Commissioner may require, which plan
shall, if deemed necessary by the Building Commissioner, be a property survey
bearing the seal of an individual authorized by law to make such surveys, and
shall show the dimensions of such lot and the location of the surveyors stakes.
The plot plan shall show the street location of the proposed building and all
existing buildings on the site; including proposed front yard, side yard and
rear yard dimensions, the front yard of buildings on other lots as required by
the Zoning Code, and the dimensions of all projections of such buildings into
the front yards, such as covered porches, vestibules or bays, existing or
proposed easements with full detail and such other information that may be
necessary to determine compliance with NBC. The plot plan shall also show the
width of the streets and alleys abutting the lot, whether or not the same are
dedicated, and the distance to the nearest platted street intersection of
record, the location and sizes of all utility lines, the location, size and
type of existing and proposed sanitary, storm or combination sewers, including
the location of the existing or proposed tee branch and building sewer (house
lateral) which serves or will serve the premises and the elevation of the sewer
invert at the point of connection. The plat shall indicate the proposed
disposition of surface drainage which shall be the responsibility of the owner.
The plat shall also show the location and size of the existing or proposed
water main and the proposed location of the water connection which serves or
will serve the premises, the location and width of the existing sidewalk in the
street, the curbs or edges of traveled roadways and the width and type of
street pavement. The information on existing and proposed structures, as
described above, shall be fully indicated on the survey plat. The survey points

elevations shall be referenced to mean sea level. A convenient bench mark shall
be indicated on the plat and such bench mark shall be maintained for the
duration of construction.
              (4)    Floor plans, including plans of full or partial basements
or cellars and full or partial attics or penthouses. Floor plans shall show all
relevant information, such as door swings, stairs and ramps, windows, shafts,
etc.; and shall be sufficiently dimensioned to describe all relevant space
sizes. Wall materials shall be described by crosshatching with explanatory key,
by notation, or by other clearly understandable method. Spaces shall be
identified by code appellation, i.e. an "Auditorium" may not be identified as
"meeting room" if its size and function dictates that it is an auditorium.
      (5)    All elevations necessary to completely describe the exterior of
the building including floor to floor dimensions.
      (6)    Cross sections, wall sections and detail sections, to scale, as
may be required to describe the general building construction, and details
which may be necessary to describe typical connections, etc.
      (7)    Complete structural description of the building on the above
drawings or on separate drawings including size and location of all principal
structural elements and a table of live loads used in the design of the
building and computations, stress diagrams and other data sufficient to show
correctness of plans.
      (8)    Complete description of the mechanical and electrical systems of
the building on the above drawings or on separate drawings, including plumbing
schematics and principal plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning
duct and piping layouts and lighting and power equipment layouts. Plans for
buildings more than two stories in height shall indicate where penetrations
will be made for electrical, mechanical, plumbing and communications conduits,
pipes and systems and the materials and methods for maintaining the required
structural integrity, fire resistance rating and fire-stopping.
              (9)    Additional graphic or text information as may be
reasonably required by the Building Commissioner to allow him to review special
or extraordinary construction methods or equipment.
   (e)   Specification Requirements. Each set of drawings submitted for a
permit shall be accompanied by a set of specifications describing all the
materials to be used and the work contemplated to be done. The specifications
shall be written in ink or typewritten or printed. The various subjects therein
shall be grouped in the order of their construction, and all matters relating
to the same subject shall be incorporated in that part of the specifications
devoted to that subject.
      (1)   Exception. Where in the opinion of the Building Commissioner all
pertinent specification data necessary to determine compliance with NBC are
adequately shown on the drawings, he may waive the requirement for submission
of the specifications.
   (f)    Responsibility for Plans. Required plans, when submitted for
inspection, shall bear the identification of the person primarily responsible
for their preparation and for the provisions for safety and sanitation shown
therein. The Building Commissioner may require that the plans, structure,
equipment and/or service facilities or part thereof bear the seal of a
professional engineer or architect duly registered and authorized to practice
his profession in the State of Ohio. However, such requirement may be waived,
whenever, in his opinion, the protection of public health, safety and property
do not require that the design of any construction, repair, alteration,
enlargement and/or demolition of any building, structure, equipment and/or
service facilities or any part thereof be performed by an individual having
qualifications as a professional engineer or architect.
   (g)    Plans Review. The review of plans and specifications to determine
compliance with the provisions of NBC shall be by a Plans Examiner meeting the
requirements of Section
1301.16 (d)(3).
   (h)    Certification by an Architect or Engineer. Plans which have been
certified by the registered architect or professional engineer who prepared the
same as conforming to the requirements of NBC pertaining to design loads,
stresses, strength and stability, or other requirements involving technical
analysis, need be examined by the Building Commissioner only to the extent
necessary to determine conformity of such plans with other requirements of NBC.
   (i)    Certification for Automatic Sprinkler System. Plans and
specifications for automatic sprinkler systems shall:
      (1)    When submitted under the signature of an individual certified
under Ohio R.C. 3781.105, be processed in the same manner as plans and
specifications submitted under the signature of a professional engineer
registered under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733 or an architect registered under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 4703. Any statistical data reports, explanations, plan description
or information that would not also be required for a similar submission by a
professional engineer or registered architect need not be submitted by a
certified designer.
      (2)    If certified by a registered architect or professional engineer or
individual certified under Ohio R.C. 3781.105 as conforming to requirements of
NBC pertaining to design loads, stresses, strength, stability or other
requirements involving technical analysis, be examined by the Building
Department official only to the extent necessary to determine conformity of
such plans and specifications with other requirements adopted by the Ohio Board
of Building Standards under Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791.
   (j)    Order of Action. All plans shall be examined in order of their
receipt, and no plan shall be acted on out of its regular order unless the work
involved is of a complex character which requires prolonged examination or
unless otherwise consented to by the building owner affected by deferred
examination of his application. Applications which are resumed without action
because of being incomplete or because of violations of some of the provisions
of NBC shall be taken in order as the date of resubmission for approval.
   (k) Plans Approval. When the Building Commissioner finds that plans
submitted for approval conform to the applicable provisions of NBC, he shall
endorse or stamp such plans as approved. When the Building Commissioner does
not meet the requirements of Section
1301.16 (d)(2)A, the approved plans shall also be endorsed or stamped by the
Plans Examiner meeting the requirements of Section
1301.16 (d)(3) who reviewed same.
   (l)    Non-conforming Plans. When plans are submitted which do not conform
with the requirements of NBC such plans may be approved by the Building
Commissioner provided such nonconformance does not consist of a condition
considered to be a serious hazard and the owner or his representative
subsequently submits revised plans, addenda or other data to show evidence of
compliance with the applicable provisions of NBC. In the event such data is not
received within a reasonable length of time, not to exceed thirty days, the
Building Commissioner shall revoke the plan approval.
   (m)    Conditional Plans. When plans are submitted which cannot be approved
under the provisions of subsections (k) and (l) hereof, the Building
Commissioner may at the request of the owner or representative of the owner,
issue a conditional plan approval when an objection to any portion of the plans
or specifications results from conflicting interpretations of NBC. No
conditional approval shall be issued where the objection is to the application
of specific technical requirements of NBC or correction of the objection would
cause extensive changes in the building design or construction. A conditional
approval is a conditional license to obtain a conditional permit in accordance
with Section
1305.03 (c).
   (n)    Partial Plan Approval.  The Building Commissioner may issue a partial
plan approval for construction of a foundation or any other part of a building
or structure before complete plans and specifications for the entire building
or structure have been submitted, provided that such approvals are issued for
various stages in sequence of construction and that all information and data
required by NBC for that portion of the building or structure has been
submitted.
   (o)    License Allowing Adjudication Hearing. The approval of plans under
this rule is a license and the failure to approve such plans as submitted
within thirty days after filing or the disapproval of such plans is an
adjudication order denying the issuance of a license requiring the opportunity
for an adjudication hearing as provided by Ohio R.C. 119.07 to 119.13 and as
modified by Ohio R.C. 3781.031 and 3781.19. An adjudication order denying the
issuance of a license shall specify the reasons for such denial.
   (p)    Imperfect Application, Drawings, Specifications or Statement. If the
application for a permit or the drawings, specifications, details or statement
accompanying the same indicate to the Building Commissioner that the work to be
done is not clearly or specifically defined and or dimensioned or is imperfect,
or is not in all respects in accordance with the provisions of NBC, he shall
refuse to issue a permit until such application, drawings, specifications,
details and statement shall have been made to conform in every respect with the
requirements thereof. All drawings which are not completely dimensioned or
which are illegible shall be deemed incomplete.
   (q)    Disposition of Plans. One set of plans and specifications approved
under subsection (k) hereof shall be retained in the Building Department. One
set of plans and specifications shall be resumed to the owner. One identical
set of plans shall be kept at the site of the work and shall be available for
reference by the Building Commissioner at all times during working hours while
such work is in progress. The Building Commissioner shall stamp or endorse
additional sets of plans which have been approved by him, when so requested by
the owner or his agent.
   (r)    Conformity to Plans. The construction, erection and alteration of a
building or other structure, and any addition thereto, and the equipment and
maintenance thereof, shall conform to the required plans which have been
approved by the Building Commissioner, except for minor deviations which do not
involve a violation of NBC.
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.03 PERMIT ISSUANCE, SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (a)   Action on Application. The Building Commissioner shall examine or
cause to be examined all applications for permits and amendments thereto within
a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the plans do not conform
to the requirements of all pertinent laws, he shall reject such application in
writing, stating the reasons therefore. If he is satisfied that the proposed
work conforms to the requirements of Norwood Building Code (NBC), and all laws
and ordinances applicable thereto, he shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable.
   (b)   Prior Approval Required. No permit for the construction of any
building or addition shall be issued by the Building Commissioner until
applicable approval from other departments has been obtained.
      (1)    Sewers. No permit for construction shall be issued until the
applicant has obtained review and approval from the Metropolitan Sewer District
of Greater Cincinnati for the installation of an adequate building sanitary
sewer (sewer lateral) and approval from the City Engineer for the installation
of an adequate building and parking area storm sewer.
      (2)   Construction water. No permit for the construction of any new
building shall be issued until approval has been obtained from the Water
Department for the use of construction water.
      (3)   Food service operations. No permit for any construction of any
building which includes facilities for food handling or food service operations
shall be issued until approval has been obtained from the Norwood Health
Commissioner.
      (4)   Driveways. When the applicant applies for a building permit upon a
dedicated street where a driveway is to be constructed he shall obtain approval
from the City Engineer before a permit is issued to assure that no traffic
problem will be created and that construction of the driveway, curb, apron and
sidewalk on the street right of way meets the requirements of the Engineering
Department.
      (5)   Parking lots. No permit for the construction of any off-street
parking area greater than 1,500 square feet shall be issued until plans for
parking and drainage have been approved by the City Engineer.
      (6)   Water supply. No permit for the construction of any building shall
be issued except where adequate water supply and facilities for fire fighting
purposes are available, as determined by the Fire Chief. If the Building
Commissioner finds upon inspection of any building under construction that
adequate water supply or facilities for fire fighting purposes, as determined
by the Fire Chief, are not being furnished as required, then the Building
Commissioner may stop such construction and revoke the permit previously issued
therefor until such time as adequate water supply or facilities for fire
fighting purposes, as determined by the Fire Chief, are furnished.
      (7)   Fire safety. No permit for the construction of any building shall
be issued until plans for fire suppression systems, occupancy load, means of
egress and other fire safety items agreed on by the Building Commissioner and
Fire Chief, have been approved by the fire safety official.
      (8)   Demolition. Before a structure can be demolished or removed, the
owner or agent shall notify all utilities having service connections within the
structure such as water, electric, gas, sewer and other connections. A permit
to demolish or remove a structure shall not be issued until a release is
obtained from the utilities, stating that their respective service connections
and appurtenant equipment, such as meters and regulators, have been removed or
sealed and plugged in a safe manner. The Plumbing Inspector shall ascertain
that all sewer lines have been removed or sealed and that all water lines are
disconnected at the mains.
      (9)   Industrialized units. Industrialized units are required to be
authorized by the Ohio Board of Building Standards prior to the issuance of a
building permit. All industrialized units shall meet the requirements of rules
4101:2-1-56 through 4101:2-1-65 of the Ohio Administrative Code.
   (c)    Conditional Permit. A conditional permit may be issued when plans
have been approved under Sections
1305.02 (l) and (m). A conditional permit is a conditional license to proceed
with construction or materials up to the point where plans are corrected or
construction or materials objected to by the Building Commissioner are to be
incorporated into the building. No construction shall proceed beyond this point
until the objection is resolved.
 
   (d)    Partial Permit. A partial permit may be issued for that part of a
building where plans have been approved under Section
1305.02 (n). The owner of a partial permit may proceed only to the point for
which approval has been given, at his own risk and without assurance that
approval for the entire building or structure will be granted.
   (e)    Violation. Except as provided in subsection (f) hereof, any person,
firm or corporation who performs work for which a permit is required by NBC
without first having secured a permit therefor shall be deemed in violation of
NBC and subject to the penalties provided by NBC.
   (f)    Emergencies. In cases of emergency where there is actual and
immediate risk of failure or collapse of a building or structure or the
existence of defective equipment or service facilities or a particularly
hazardous use such as to endanger life or health or such other condition as to
require immediate action to make repairs or corrections necessary to prevent
the occurrence of such failure to collapse or the occurrence of such danger and
time available is not sufficient to allow the securing of a permit from the
Building Commissioner as required by NBC, the person, firm or corporation
required to perform such repairs may proceed to do so after having first
notified the Building Commissioner of such fact without obtaining a permit as
required by NBC. In case the Building Commissioner is unavailable, notice shall
be given to the nearest fire or police official.
   (g)    Failure to Obtain Permits Before Starting Work.  Any person who
commences any installation of work for which a permit is required by NBC,
without first having obtained a permit therefor shall, if legally authorized
and subsequently allowed to obtain a permit, pay the permit fees prescribed by
Section
1305.05(i), provided however, that this requirement shall not apply to
emergency work or installations as provided by subsection (f) hereof when it
shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Building Commissioner that such work
or installation was urgently necessary and that it would have been impractical
to have awaited the normal time consumed in application for and issuance of the
permit. Nevertheless, even in such emergencies the required permit shall be
obtained without unreasonable delay after installation starts, and in no case
more than three days in which City offices are open for business, or the extra
fee as herein provided shall be charged for the permit. Before issuing such
permit, the Building Commissioner shall take necessary steps to determine
whether work performed prior to the date of permit and inspection conform to
NBC. Such steps may include but shall not be limited to directing the tearing
out of sections of surface work for access to subsurface sections, digging for
access to foundations, piping and other subterranean work and the like. The
applicant for the permit shall perform all such work as may be directed at his
own expense.
   (h)    Suspension of Permit. Any permit issued shall become invalid if the
authorized work is not commenced within six months after issuance of the
permit, or if the authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of six
months after the time of commencing the work.
   (i)   Revocation of Permit. The Building Commissioner may revoke any permit
or approval issued under the provisions of NBC or may stop the work for any of
the following reasons:
      (1)   Whenever there is a violation of any provision of NBC, any
ordinance of the City or statute of the State relating to the same subject
matter;
      (2)   Whenever the continuance of any work becomes dangerous to life or
property;
      (3)   Whenever there is a violation of any condition on which the
issuance of the permit or approval was based;
      (4)   Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
upon the application, plans or specifications on which the issuance of the
permit or approval was based;
      (5)   When orders on a building have not been complied with or when the
building does not comply with the occupancy requirements;
      (6)    Whenever adequate water supply or facilities for fire fighting
purposes are not furnished as required in Section
1305.03(b)(6);
      (7)    Whenever in the opinion of the Building Commissioner the person
having charge of the work is incompetent.
   The revocation notice of the permit in every instance shall be in writing
and shall be served upon the holder of the permit, the owner, his agent, or the
person having charge of the work. Any revocation notice shall also be posted
upon the building or structure in question by the Building Commissioner. After
the notice is received or posted, no person shall proceed with any operation
for which such a permit was issued. No part of the fees for such permit shall
be resumed.
   Revocation of a permit shall be subject to appeal to the Board as provided
in Section
1305.17.
   (j)    Posting of Permit. The permit shall be posted in a conspicuous
location outside of the building and in the front part of the premises on which
is, or will be, located the building or equipment to which the approved plans
relate. The owner and the contractor shall, so far as possible, preserve and
keep such permit posted until the completion of the work to which the approved
plans relate.
   Upon application by the owner, the Building Commissioner shall issue a
duplicate permit to replace one destroyed by vandals or one which is
accidentally destroyed.
   (k)   Notice of Start. At least twenty-four hours notice of start of work
under a building permit shall be given to the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.04 PERMIT CONDITIONS.
   (a)    Payment of Fees. No permit shall be issued, and no amendment to a
plan application for permit, or other submission, shall be approved or
certified, until the fees prescribed in Section
1305.05 have been paid.
   (b)   Compliance with NBC. A permit shall be an authorization to proceed
with the work, but shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel or
set aside any of the provisions of Norwood Building Code (NBC), zoning laws or
other applicable laws except as specifically allowed by lawfully granted
modification or deviation.
   (c) Compliance with Permit. All work shall conform to the approved
application and plans for which the permit has been issued and any approved
amendments thereto.
   (d)    Compliance with Plot Plan. All new work shall be located strictly in
accordance with the approved plot and location plan.
   (e) Change in Plot. No lot or plot shall be changed, increased or diminished
in area from that shown in the application for permit without first amending
the application to that effect, except where the change is caused by reason of
an official street opening, street widening or other public improvement.
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.05 FEES.
   (a)    General. A permit to begin work for new construction, alteration,
removal, demolition or other building operation shall not be issued until the
fees prescribed in this section have been paid to the Building Department or
other authorized City agency, nor shall an amendment to a permit necessitating
an additional fee be approved until the additional fee has been paid.
   (b) Special Fees. The payment of the fee for the construction, alteration,
removal or demolition of all work done in connection with or concurrently with
the work contemplated by a building permit, shall not relieve the applicant or
holder of the permit from the payment of other fees that may be prescribed by
law or ordinance for water taps, sewer connections, electrical permits,
erection of signs and display structures, marquees or other appurtenant
structures, or fees for inspection, certificate of use and occupancy or other
privileges or requirements, both within and without the jurisdiction of the
Building Department.
   (c) Fees for Nonclassified Items.  Where fees are not specifically provided,
they shall be assigned to that classification by the Building Commissioner as
determined most reasonable and appropriate.
   (d) Fees Based on Valuation. The cost as applicable to permit fees for new
buildings, additions, equipment and alterations and repairs to existing
buildings and equipment shall be based on the valuation of the buildings,
additions, equipment and alterations and repairs. The Building Commissioner
shall have the right to verify and correct the estimated cost using generally
accepted methods of estimating such as those prescribed by the model code
organization, construction data services and similar agencies. Calculation of
the fees shall be in accordance with the fee schedules prescribed in Table
1305.05.
   (e) Plan Examination Fees.  When plans are required, no application for a
permit shall be accepted for filing unless the applicant at the time of filing
pays the plan examination fee prescribed in Table
1305.05(c). Plan examination fees shall be based on the estimated cost of the
work, as shown on the application; shall be in addition to the payment of the
regular permit fee and any other fee which may accrue thereafter; and no
portion of such plan examination fee shall be refunded.
   (f)    Plumbing Licensing. Each application for examination, registration or
a license for a plumber shall be accompanied by the required fees. No part of
any examination fee shall be refunded because of failure of the applicant to
undergo the examination or to qualify for a certificate. All registrations and
licenses shall expire on December 31 next succeeding the date of issue, and no
reduction shall be made for any part of the year elapsed.
   (g)    Blocking Streets and Sidewalks. The Safety-Service Director shall
determine whether permission can be granted for the temporary blocking or use
of streets, sidewalks, alleys or other public rights of way or for the purpose
of construction, depositing material or placing equipment thereon or for other
purposes.
   (h)    Work Performed on City Right of Way. The permit fee for inspection of
work performed on City right of way shall be for inspection only and apply for
either new installation or replacement. All material or labor shall be
furnished by the contractor.
   Where any combination of sidewalk, driveway across City property, curb cut
and apron are inspected at the same time, a charge will be made for only that
item having the maximum fee.    Before a permit is issued, the contractor shall
give bond to the City in the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) conditioned
to repair paving if improperly laid. A property owner may provide an approved
certificate allowing for a lien against the property in lieu of a bond.
   (i)    Commencing Work Prior to Permit Issuance. Where the work for which a
permit is required by NBC is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining such
permit, the permit fine hereinafter specified may, at the discretion of the
Building Commissioner or the Director of Safety, be imposed at three times the
amount of the permit fee, plus the cost of the permit fee. The total cost of
the permit shall be the permit fee and the permit penalty. A maximum one
thousand dollars ($1,000) penalty may apply. A second offense by the same
applicant within any twelve month period may constitute doubling all minimum
and maximum penalty fees. The payment of such penalty fees shall not relieve
any person from fully complying with the requirements of the NBC in the
execution of the work, nor from any other penalty prescribed herein.
   (j)    Revised and Addendum Plans. In the event substitute or revised plans
or an addendum to the original plan is submitted for a building or site on
which a permit has been requested, an additional permit shall be obtained for
each such change and/or addition. Minor addendum plans that do not alter space
or change structural requirements may be charged for the hourly time of review,
with a one-half hour minimum.
   (k)    Expiration and Renewal of Permits. Upon expiration of a permit, no
work shall be permitted until the permit is renewed, for which renewal a fee
shall be charged based on the cost of the unfinished work.
   (l) Cancellation and Refunds.  Upon written request, prior to commencement
of any work, permits may be canceled by the holder, and part of the permit fee
will be refunded in accordance with the fee schedule.
   (m)    Work Performed by Schools.
      (1)    "School" for the purpose of this section is defined as any
institution regulated by the State Board of Education or the State Department
of Education for grade levels K-12 pursuant to the authority granted by Ohio
Revised Code Sections 3301.07, 3301.53, and 3301.71.
      (2)    Schools shall be exempt from paying building or zoning permits
fees.
         (Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)

"handicapped accessible ramp" in the yard of a one-, two-, or three-family
house, pursuant to Section
1151.16.1, shall be exempt from building or zoning permit fees, but will be
subject to any "Plan Examination Fees" applicable under Section
1305.05(e).
(Ord. 31-2019. Passed 8-13-19.)
1305.06 INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   Preliminary Inspection. Before issuing a permit, the Building
Commissioner may examine or cause to be examined all buildings, structures and
sites for which an application has been filed for a permit to construct,
enlarge, alter, repair, remove, demolish or change the use thereof.
   (b)   Required Inspections. After issuing a building permit, the Building
Commissioner shall conduct such inspections from time to time during and upon
completion of the work for which a permit has been issued. A record of all such
examinations and inspections and of all violations of Norwood Building Code
(NBC), shall be maintained by the Building Commissioner.
   (c)    Lot Line Markers Required. Before any work is started in the
construction of a new principal building or major addition to a building and in
all other cases where the Building Commissioner may require, all boundary lines
shall be clearly marked at their intersections with permanent markers or with
markers which are offset at a distance which is of record with the owner.
   (d)    Notice. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to notify the
Building Commissioner when work is ready for the various inspections required
by the terms of the permit or the approved rules. Such notice shall be given
within a reasonable time from which such inspection is desired but in no event
shall be less than twenty-four hours. Notice given on a Friday or on a day
prior to a legal holiday shall not constitute notice for inspection on a
Saturday, Sunday or holiday unless arrangements have been made under approved
rules for inspection on such days. Before giving such notice the permittee
shall first test the work and satisfy himself that it conforms to the approved
plans and specifications and the requirements of NBC.
   (e) Action on Notice. Upon receipt of notice that work is ready for
inspection the Building Commissioner shall inspect or cause it to be inspected
as soon as is reasonably practicable, however, failure of the Building
Commissioner to make a prompt inspection shall not be deemed justification for
covering work without inspection when such work is required under the terms of
the permit to be inspected before being covered.
   (f)    Covering Work. It shall be a violation of NBC to cover prior to
inspection any work required to be inspected under the provisions of a permit,
the approved rules, or NBC irrespective of any penalties for such violation.
The Building Commissioner shall require the permittee to uncover any such work
for inspection and the cost of uncovering such work and of replacing the cover
after the work has been found satisfactory shall be borne by the permittee.
   (g)    Special Professional Services. Where applications for unusual design
or magnitude of construction are filed or where code reference standards in the
OBC require special architectural or engineering inspections, the Building
Commissioner may require full time project representations by an architect or
engineer. This project representative shall keep daily records and submit
reports as required by the Building Commissioner. The installation of an
automatic sprinkler system may be supervised by a person certified under Ohio
R.C. 3781.105 in lieu of supervision by a registered architect or professional
engineer.
   (h)    Approved Inspection Agencies. The Building Commissioner may accept
reports of approved inspection agencies which satisfy the requirements as to
qualifications and reliability.
   (i)   Plant Inspection. When required by the provisions of NBC or State law
or by the approved rules, materials or assemblies shall be inspected at the
point of manufacture of fabrication in accordance with subsection (o) hereof
and the OBC. The cost of all such inspections shall be borne by the applicant
therefor.
   (j)    Inspection Reports. All inspection reports shall be in writing and
shall be certified by the licensed authority, or responsible officer of the
agency, or the individual when expert inspection services are accepted. An
identifying label or stamp permanently affixed to the product indicating that
factory inspection has been made shall be accepted in lieu of the aforesaid
inspection report in writing if the intent or meaning of such identifying label
or stamp is properly substantiated.
   (k)   Final Inspection. Upon completion of the building or structure, and
before issuance of the certificate of use and occupancy required in Section
1305.08 , a final inspection shall be made. All violations of the approved
plans and permit shall be noted and the permittee shall be notified of the
discrepancies.
  
   (l)    Right of Entry. In the discharge of duties, the Building Commissioner
or an authorized representative shall have the authority to enter at any
reasonable hour any building, structure or premises in the jurisdiction to
enforce the provisions of NBC, except that no such employee shall enter a part
of a building which is "private" and occupied as such, as defined in Section
1301.02 until he has shown his credentials to the occupant thereof and secured
his permission to enter such private part of the building. Such requirement
does not apply where a state of emergency exists.
   (m)    Credentials. Before entering upon a premises or while on a premises
in the performance of his duties in the enforcement of NBC, an employee of the
Building Department shall show his credentials upon request by the owner of the
premises involved or by the contractor performing work on such premises.
   (n)   Jurisdictional Cooperation. The assistance and cooperation of the
Police, Fire and Health Departments and all other officials shall be available
as required in the performance of duties.
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.07 WORKMANSHIP.
   All work shall be conducted, installed and completed in a workmanlike and
acceptable manner so as to secure the results intended by Norwood Building Code
(NBC).
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.08 CERTIFICATES OF USE AND OCCUPANCY.
   (a)    New Buildings. A building or structure hereafter erected shall not be
used, occupied or rented in whole or in part until a certificate of use and
occupancy for each unit has been issued by the Building Commissioner.
   (b)   Buildings Hereafter Altered. A building or structure hereafter
enlarged, extended or altered, in whole or in part, shall not be used, occupied
or rented until a certificate of use and occupancy has been issued; except that
any use or occupancy for which a certificate had previously been issued, which
was not discontinued during the work of alteration shall require the issuance
of a certificate by the Building Commissioner within thirty days after
completion of the work of alteration.

of the building or structure a written notice describing the building or
structure deemed unsafe and specifying the required repairs or improvements to

   (d)   Restoration.  A building or structure condemned by the Building
Commissioner may be restored to safe condition provided change of use or
occupancy is not contemplated or compelled by reason of such reconstruction or

   (a)    Vacating Structures. When the Building Commissioner determines that
there is actual and immediate risk of failure or collapse of a building or
structure or any part thereof or the existence of defective equipment or
service facilities such as to endanger life or health, or when any structure or
part of a structure has fallen or failed and use or occupancy of the structure,
equipment, service facility and/or equipment or part thereof would, in his
opinion, endanger life or health or where there is a particularly hazardous use
of the building or structure such as to endanger life or health, the Building
Commissioner is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the
occupants and tenants to vacate the same forthwith, and/or to immediately
cease, and refrain from use or operation of the building, structure, equipment,
service facility or part thereof which is deemed dangerous or to cease such

or failure of a building or structure or any part thereof which would endanger
life, the Building Commissioner shall cause the necessary work to be done to

against the owner of the premises where the unsafe building, structure,
equipment or service facility is or was located for the recovery of such costs
in the manner provided by Section
1305.10(k).
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.14 VACATIONS.
   (a)    General.  The Building Commissioner shall be authorized to order any
building or portion of any building vacated, or if it is vacant to remain
vacated for any of the reasons specified as follows:
      (1)    Norwood Building Code (NBC) violation. When a building is
occupied, or any work, operation or construction is performed therein or
thereon in violation of any of the provisions of NBC.
      (2)    Unsafe or insanitary building. When the Building Commissioner
determines that the building is unsafe or insanitary.
      (3)    Noncompliance.  When the owner, agent or tenant fails or refuses
to comply with any lawful order issued by the Building Commissioner.
   (b) Notices to Vacate. Every order to vacate shall be in writing and shall
be served upon the owner, agent or tenant, stating the reason for the order to
vacate and directing that the building or portion of the building, if it is
occupied, be vacated by a specified time.
   (c)    Placarding of Structure. After the notice to vacate required under
the provisions of NBC has resulted in an order by virtue of failure to comply
within the time given, the Building Commissioner may post on the premises or
structure or parts thereof, or on defective equipment, a placard in accordance
with the provisions of Section
1305.11.
   (d)    Closing of Vacant Structure. If the structure or part thereof is
vacant and unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use and is not in danger of
structural collapse, the Building Commissioner may post a placard of
condemnation on the premises and may order the structure closed up so it will
not be an attractive nuisance to youngsters. Upon failure of the owner to close
up the premises within the time specified in the order, the Building
Commissioner shall cause it to be closed through any available public agency or
by contract or arrangement by private persons. Costs incurred by the Building
Commissioner shall be paid by the City Treasurer on his certification and the
costs recovered in the manner provided by Section
1305.10(k).
   (e)   Prohibited Use. When any person, being the owner, agent or having
control of a building, structure or dwelling unit fails to comply with an order
of vacation issued by the Building Commissioner and either occupies or allows
the building, structure or dwelling unit to be occupied by persons other than
himself, such person shall be in violation of Section
1305.14(a), unless he can show by preponderance of the evidence that the
property is being occupied without his knowledge or consent. Proper service of
an eviction notice or the good faith maintenance of forcible entry and detained
proceedings against occupants shall be prima-facie evidence of lack of
knowledge and consent. Any person who occupies a placarded premises or
structure or part thereof, or uses placarded equipment, and any owner or any
person responsible for the premises who lets anyone occupy a placarded premises
shall be liable for the penalties provided by Section
1305.99.
   (f)   Rescinding Order to Vacate. The Building Commissioner shall rescind
the order to vacate and remove the placard whenever the defect or defects upon
which the vacating and placarding action were based have been eliminated.
   (g)    Vacant Building Structure Declared a Public Nuisance. Buildings which
remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of time become an
attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an invitation to
derelicts, vagrants and criminals as a temporary abode, and an increased fire
hazard and the unkept grounds surrounding such property invite the dumping of
garbage and rubbish thereon. Such buildings are permitted to become dilapidated
since such buildings are often economically obsolete and the owners of such
buildings are unwilling to expend the necessary funds to repair or raze the
building; such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within the City,
depress market values of surrounding properties and require additional
governmental services. The use and maintenance of property in such condition
and manner endangers the public safety and health constitutes an unreasonable
use and condition to the annoyance, discomfort and repose of a considerable
number of the public, is detrimental to the public good and to the common
welfare, and renders a considerable number of the public insecure in the use
and enjoyment of their property, and thus may constitute a nuisance condition.
 
   (h)   Nuisance Condition Defined. A building within the City shall be deemed
a nuisance condition if:
      (1)    It is vacant and unoccupied for the purpose for which it was
erected and for which purpose a certificate of occupancy may have been issued;
and
      (2)    The building is unfit for occupancy as it fails to meet the
minimum standards set out by City ordinances before a certificate of occupancy
can be granted, or is unfit for human habitation because it fails to meet the
minimum standards set out in Norwood Property Maintenance Code (NPMC), or the
doors, windows and other openings into the building are boarded up or otherwise
secured by a means other than the conventional methods used in the original
construction and design of the building; and,
      (3)    The building has remained substantially in such condition for a
period of at least nine months. When it is determined by the Building
Commissioner and the Fire Chief that a building constitutes an immediate hazard
to the public health and safety, and after approval by Council the nine month
waiting period set out in this section may be waived and the other procedures,
as set out in this chapter, may be implemented immediately.
   (i)   Demolition of Nuisance Building. Vacant buildings or structures,
determined to be a public nuisance by the Building Commissioner may be
demolished in accordance with procedures of Section
1305.15.
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.15 DEMOLITION.
   (a)   The Building Commissioner may order the owner of premises upon which
is located any structure or part thereof to raze and remove such structure or
part thereof for any of the following reasons:
        (1)   When the Building Commissioner determines that the structure or
any part thereof is in an advanced state of disrepair and endangers the health
and safety of the public or is otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy
or use, so that it would be unreasonable to repair the same;
      (2)    It is a vacant building declared to be a public nuisance in
accordance with Section
1305.14(g);
      (3)    Construction was not in accordance with approved plans or without
a building permit or after issuance of a stop work order; or
      (4)    Where there has been a cessation of normal construction of any
structure for a period of more than nine months.
   (b)   Whenever the Building Commissioner determines that the cost of such
repairs would exceed sixty percent (60%) of the current value of such
structure, such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed
for the purpose of this section that such structure is a public nuisance which
may be ordered razed and removed.
   (c)   Initial orders shall be in accordance with Section
1305.10(b). Failure to comply with the orders within the specified time shall
allow the Building Commissioner to issue an order in accordance with Section
1305.10(f). The Building Commissioner may, upon good cause shown, allow the
owner such additional time as may be necessary to abate the unsafe nuisance
condition.
   (d) The Building Commissioner shall be authorized to take the following
steps:
      (1)    At least thirty days prior to the demolition of the building or
structure, the Building Commissioner shall notify all owners and lien holders
of record of the property by certified mail, return receipt requested, priority
mail with delivery confirmation, by publication at least once in a newspaper of
general circulation in Norwood, or by posting a notice in a conspicuous place

duly authorized officer under contract or arrangement may sell the salvage and
materials in the following manner:
      (1)    Notice of the sale shall be given by published advertisement in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City of Norwood once a week for three
consecutive weeks prior to the date of the sale.
      (2)    All such sales shall be public sales/auctions.
      (3)    The net proceeds of the sale, after deducting the expenses of
razing and removing such structure and advertising and sales expenses, shall be
remitted to the owners and lien holders of record in order of priority, subject
to any order of the court. A report of the sale, including the items of expense
and the amounts deducted shall be remitted with the net surplus. If such a
surplus does not remain, the report of the sale
   (f) The Law Director, at the request of the Building Commissioner, may
institute proceedings to recover the total cost in accordance with the
provisions of Section
1305.10(k).
(Ord. 15-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1305.16  REMOVAL OF UNLAWFUL SIGNS.
   Should any sign be installed, erected or maintained in violation of any of
the provisions of Norwood Building Code (NBC), the Building Commissioner shall
notify forthwith the owner, occupant or person in charge of property on which
the sign is situated, by certified mail, sent to the last known address of the
person to be notified or by personal service, to remove such sign within
seventy-two hours from the date of such notice. In the event of noncompliance
with such notice, the Building Commissioner shall cause the sign to be removed.
Costs incurred shall be paid by the City Treasurer and the Law Director shall
institute such action as may be appropriate to recover such costs from the
owner in accordance with the provisions of Section

   (a)   Jurisdiction. The Norwood Board of Building Appeals is hereby
established to conduct all adjudication hearings or other appeals for the
following buildings and structures:
      (1)    Single-family, two-family and three-family dwellings which are not
constructed of industrialized units, except where the context specifies
mandatory applicability of the Ohio Basic Building Code (OBBC).
      (2)    Existing buildings and structures where their location, parts,
equipment and other items do not constitute a serious hazard.
      (3)   Any other building or structure under the authority of Norwood
Building Code (NBC) which is not heard by the Ohio Board of Building Appeals.
   (b)   Membership. The Norwood Board of Zoning Appeals as created in Zoning
Code Section
1117.01 shall act as the Norwood Board of Building Appeals. The Building
Commissioner shall appoint one member of the Building Department to act as
secretary to the Board.
   (c)    Absence of Members. During temporary absence of a member, the Mayor
may appoint alternate members who may sit on the Board. Such alternates shall
meet the same qualifications as required for regular Board members and, while
sitting on the Board, shall have the full power and authority of the regular
member.
   (d) Financial Interest. A member of the Board shall not participate in any
hearings or vote on any appeal in which that member has a direct or indirect
financial interest or is engaged as a contractor, or is engaged in the
preparation of plans and specifications, or in which that member has any
personal interest.
   (e) Appeals Procedure.
      (1)    Petition. Any person who is directly affected by any notice which
has been issued in connection with the enforcement of any provision of NBC, or
of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Board; provided that such person
files, in the office of the Board, a written petition requesting such hearing
within thirty days of the date of receipt of a written decision from the
Building Commissioner. The appeal shall include proposed alternatives,
modifications or substitutions, complete plans of the structure, other
pertinent information and payment of fees.
      (2)    Grounds. The appeal shall be based on one or both of the following
grounds:
         A.   That the interpretation, ruling or order is erroneous or
constitutes an erroneous application of the particular provisions of NBC or
related laws and ordinances involved, or is otherwise contrary to law.
         B.   That a modified application or alternative arrangement is
available and feasible whereby the strict application of a particular provision
or provisions may be modified with alternatives without defeating the public
safety, health and general welfare, purpose and intent of the provisions of
NBC, as provided for in subsection (g) hereof.
      (3)   Meetings. The Board shall meet within thirty days after the filing
of any appeal or request for action with the Secretary of the Board, and also
periodically if the volume of its work so warrants. Three Board members shall
constitute a quorum. All hearings shall be public, and any person, either in
person or by attorney, whose interests may be directly affected by the matter
on appeal, shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The chairman, or, in his
absence, the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of
witnesses. Minutes shall be kept of all proceedings and official actions, which
minutes shall be filed in the office of the Board, and shall be a public
record.
      (4)   Fee for appeal or action. Each petition for an appeal to the Board
shall be accompanied by a fee prescribed in Section
1305.05(l), to partially compensate the City for the direct and indirect
expenditures, costs and extra work occasioned by the filing and prosecution of
the appeal. Such filing fee shall be in addition to the payment of the regular
building permit fee and any other fee which thereafter may accrue, and no
portion of such filing fee shall be refunded whatever the outcome of the
appeal.
   (f)    Decisions.
      (1)    In exercising its power, the Board shall affirm, modify or reverse
the decision of the Building Commissioner by a concurring vote of three
members. Failure to secure three concurring votes shall be deemed a
confirmation of the decision of the Building Commissioner. The decision of the
Board is final, but a rehearing shall be granted in accordance with the
requirements of subsection (f)(3) hereof. The Board shall provide the appellant
and the Building Commissioner with written notice of its determination within
fifteen days after the hearing.
      (2)    Records. The Secretary of the Board shall keep a record of each
meeting so that the record shows clearly the basis for each decision made by
the Board.
      (3)    Rehearing. The Board shall, upon application of either the
appellant or the Building Commissioner, grant rehearing before the Board in any
case where new evidence is presented which in the opinion of the chairman may
justify such rehearing. Such rehearing shall not serve to stop execution of the
previous decision of the Board pending the rehearing except by special action
of the Board so directing.
      (4)   Enforcement. The Building Commissioner shall take immediate action
in accordance with the decision of the Board.
      (5)   Judicial review.  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board
whether or not a previous party to the decision, or any official or official
board of the jurisdiction, may present to the court having jurisdiction over
the matter, within thirty days after the filing of the Board's decision in the
office of the Building Commissioner, a petition, duly verified, stating that
the decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the grounds for
illegality and asking relief therefrom.
   (g)    Alternate Methods, Materials and Fixtures. 
      (1)    General. The provisions of NBC are not intended to prevent the use
of any material, device, methods of assemblage or installation, fixture or
appurtenance not specifically authorized, provided such alternate has been
approved by the Board in accordance with this section.
      (2)   Research and investigations. The Board may make or cause to be made
investigations of new developments in the building industry; it shall accredit
tests meeting the functional requirements of NBC conducted by accredited
authoritative agencies when properly presented to the Board; it may accept duly
authenticated reports from recognized authoritative sources of all new
materials and methods of construction proposed for use which are not
specifically provided for in NBC. Whenever in the opinion of the Building
Commissioner it shall be necessary to make or cause to be made any test or
investigation before approving any application, he shall so notify the
applicant therein and the Board, and the latter shall proceed with regard
thereto only upon agreement by such applicant to pay the costs of any and all
such tests and investigations. The Board shall have power to act upon the
results of such research, investigations and tests, and upon such reports, by
approving new materials, types of construction, appliances, devices and
appurtenances proposed for use under NBC, and shall promulgate rules
establishing the conditions for use thereof consistent with the provisions of
NBC and with accepted engineering practice. In the absence of approved rules,
the regulations, specifications and standard listed in OBBC appendices shall be
the accepted engineering practice in respect to the material, equipment, system
or method of construction therein specified.
      (3)   Approval. Approval by the Board shall be based upon acceptable
evidence, assembled and submitted by the applicant that such material, device,
method of assembly or installation, fixture or appurtenance conforms to the
applicable requirements of NBC or where no specific requirements apply, to the
intent and purpose of NBC.

1321.01 INTENT.
   (a)   It is the purpose of this Sign Code to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of residents and visitors in the City through
reasonable, consistent, and non-discriminatory Sign standards. The Sign
regulations in this Chapter are not intended to censor speech or to regulate
viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the adverse secondary effects
of Signs. The Sign regulations are especially intended to reach the secondary
effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and safety, especially traffic
safety. In order to preserve and promote the City as a desirable community in
which to live and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is
of foremost importance. The regulation of Signs within the City contributes
significantly to this desired end. These Sign regulations have been prepared
with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the City and promoting
its continued well-being, and are intended to:
      (1)   Encourage the effective use of Signs as a means of communication in
the City;
      (2)   Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the City's
ability to attract sources of economic development and growth;
      (3)   Improve pedestrian and traffic safety;
      (4)   Curtail the size and number of Signs to minimize the possible
adverse effects of Sign clutter or Signs that conceal or obstruct adjacent land
uses or Signs on nearby public and private property;
      (5)   Foster the integration of signage with the building's architecture
and the landscape's design;
      (6)   Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the
proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height,
and excessive size (area) of Signs which compete for the attention of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic;
      (7)   Encourage and allow Signs that are appropriate to the zoning
district;
      (8)   Establish regulations for Sign size that relate to the scale of the
lot and building on which the Sign is to be placed or to which it pertains;
      (9)   Categorize and tailor the regulation of Signs based upon types and
content neutral characteristics;
      (10)   Preclude Signs from conflicting with the permitted use of the site
and adjoining sites;
      (11)   Regulate Signs in a manner so as to not distract, interfere with,
or obstruct the vision of motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians;
      (12)   Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law,
ensure that Signs are constructed, installed, and maintained in a safe and
satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe Signs;
      (13)   Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and
scenic beauty of all districts of the City;
      (14)   Allow for traffic control devices and signs consistent with
national or state standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and
efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and
highways, and that notify road users of regulations and provide warning and
guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements
of the traffic stream;
      (15)   Protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent
possible, Sign-types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other
properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or
movement;
      (16)   Protect property values by ensuring that Sign-types, as well as
the number of Signs, are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and
conforming Signs in the area;
      (17)   Regulate the appearance and design of Signs in a manner that
promotes and enhances the beautification of the City; and
      (18)   Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these Sign
regulations.

1325.01 VACATIONS.
   (a)    The Building Commissioner shall be authorized to order any building
or portion of any building vacated, or if it is vacant to remain vacated for
one or more of the reasons set out below.
      (1)    When a building is occupied, or any work, operation or
construction is performed therein or thereon in violation of any of the
provisions of the Norwood Building Code, Property Maintenance Code, Zoning
Code, or any other applicable provisions in the Codified Ordinances for the
City of Norwood.
      (2)    When one or more of the following has occurred:
         A.   The building is unfit for occupancy as it fails to meet the
minimum standards set out by City ordinances before a Certificate of Occupancy
can be granted,
         B.   The building is unfit for human habitation because it fails to
meet the minimum    standards set out in the Norwood Property Maintenance Code
(NPMC), or
         C.   The doors, windows, and other openings into the building are
boarded up or otherwise secured by means other than the conventional method
used in the original construction and design of the building.
      (3)    When the owner, agent, or tenant fails or refuses to comply with
any lawful order issued by the Building Commissioner.
      (4)    When the building is vacant and unoccupied for the purpose which
it was erected and for which purpose a certificate of occupancy may have been
issued.
      (5)    When it is determined by the Building Commissioner and the Fire
Chief that a building constitutes an immediate hazard to the public health and/
or safety.
   (b)    If, after service of any lawful order from the Building Commissioner,
the owner, agent, contractor or other person responsible for the work or
violation refuses to comply with such order or does not comply within the
period stated in the order of notice, such failure to comply shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the first degree punishable as provided for in Section
1305.99.
(Ord. 16-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1325.02  VACANT BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES DECLARED A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Buildings which remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of
time become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an
invitation to derelicts, vagrants, and criminals as a temporary abode, and an
increased fire hazard and the unkept grounds surrounding such property invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish thereon. The use and maintenance of property
in such condition and manner endangers the public health and safety and
constitutes an unreasonable use and condition to the annoyance, discomfort, and
repose of a considerable number of the public, is detrimental to the public
good and common welfare, and renders a considerable number of the public
insecure in the use and enjoyment of their property, and thus constitutes a
nuisance condition.
(Ord. 16-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1325.03 VACATION NOTICES.
   (a)    Every order of vacation shall be in writing stating the reason for
the order or vacation and directing that the building or portion of the
building, if it is occupied, be vacated by a specified time and shall be served
upon the owner, agent or tenant by personal serivice, priority mail with
delivery confirmation, or certified mail with return receipt requested. In
addition to providing service to the owner, agent or tenant, the Building
Commissioner shall post a notice of vacation in a conspicuous place on the
building. After the posting of such notice or order of vacation, it shall be
unlawful to occupy or permit the occupancy of the premises or any portion
thereof until the provisions of law and the orders issued by the Building
Commissioner are complied with.
   (b)    When it shall appear to the Building Commissioner that the reasons
for the order of vacation have ceased to exist and that the building or portion
of the building and the occupancy thereof are in substantial compliance with
law, he shall rescind the vacation order in writing.
(Ord. 16-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1325.04 VACATED BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, OR DWELLING UNITS NOT TO BE RENTED.
   When any person, being the owner, agent or having control of a building,
structure, or dwelling unit, fails to comply with an order of vacation issued
by the Building Commissioner and allows the building, structure, or dwelling
unit to be occupied by persons other than himself, such person shall be in
violation of Section
1325.03 unless he can show that the property is being occupied without his
knowledge or consent. Proper service of an eviction notice and the good faith
maintenance of forcible entry and detainer proceedings against occupants shall
be prima facie evidence of lack of knowledge and consent. The penalty for
violation shall be as provided in Section
1325.99.
(Ord. 16-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1325.05 SECURING OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)    If a vacant or vacated building or structure is open to access by
trespassers and/or the elements, the Building Commissioner may order any
openings secured to prevent trespassers and/or the elements from entering such
building. The securing of such doors, windows and other openings shall be
maintained as long as the building is vacant or until the windows, doors and
other openings are repaired in an approved manner.
   (b)    If, after service of an order to secure a building or structure, the
owner or agent fails to comply with that order of the Building Commissioner
within the time allowed by that order, or fails to maintain the building or
structure secure from entry, the Commissioner may at any time thereafter
proceed under Section
1325.06 to secure the building and restore the premises to a safe condition.
(Ord. 16-2010. Passed 4-13-10.)
1325.06 SECURING OF BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES BY THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
   (a)    The Building Commissioner may secure and barricade any building
whenever:
      (1)    The building or structure has been deemed dangerous and unsafe
pursuant to Section
1305.12, and the owner has failed to bring the building into compliance with
the NBC within the time provided, but the building has not been determined as
threatening to collapse or posing other immediate peril, pursuant to Section
1305.13; or
      (2)    The owner or person responsible has failed to comply with an order
of the Building Commissioner to secure the building or structure issued
pursuant to Section
1325.05.
   (b)    Whenever a building or structure is subject to being secured pursuant
to this section the Building Commissioner shall:
      (1)    Serve the building owner as determined from the official land
records of Hamilton County by personal delivery, by certified mail return
receipt requested, or by priority mail with delivery confirmation with a notice
of intent to secure.
      (2)    The Commissioner shall also post a copy of the notice of intent to
secure on the building.
      (3)    The notice of intent to secure shall set forth the street address
of the building and the date of intended entry on the premises in order to
secure the building.
   (c)    Upon service of notice of intent to secure the premises pursuant to
Section

time specified in the order, the Building Commissioner shall cause it to be
secured through any available public agency or contract or arrangement by
private persons.
   (d)    Any person who owns any interest in a building other than a lien
shall be jointly and severally liable for the costs incurred by the Building
Commissioner pursuant to
1325.06 and for service of notice.
   (e)    The owner or owners shall be billed directly by priority mail with
delivery confirmation certified mail, return receipt requested, or by posting a
copy of the bill upon the building if the Building Commissioner is unable to
contact the owner for the cost. The bill for the cost shall be paid within

      (1)    Establishing minimum maintenance standards for all structures and

for safe and sanitary maintenance of all structures and premises now in
existence;
      (2)    Fixing the responsibilities of owners, operators and occupants of
all structures; and
      (3)    Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.
   (b)    Intent. The NPMC shall be construed liberally and justly to insure
public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by maintenance
of structures and premises.
   (c)    Other Regulations. The provisions in the NPMC shall not be construed
to prevent the enforcement of other ordinances or regulations which prescribe
standards other than are provided herein.
   (d)    Application of Building Code. Any repairs or alterations to a
structure, or changes of use herein, which may be caused directly or indirectly
by the enforcement of the NPMC shall be done in accordance with the procedures
and provisions of the Norwood Building Code (NBC).
   (e)    Existing Remedies. The provisions in the NPMC shall not be deemed to
abolish or impair existing remedies of the City or its officers or agencies
relating to the removal or demolition of any buildings which are deemed to be
dangerous, unsafe and unsanitary.
(Ord. 72-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1331.03 VALIDITY.
   (a)    Validity. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or
phrase of the Norwood Property Maintenance Code (NPMC) shall be declared

end the provisions of the NPMC are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)    Saving Clause. The NPMC shall not affect violations of any other
ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date hereof, and

(Ord. 72-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1331.04  EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   As provided in this chapter, the Norwood Property Maintenance Code (NPMC)

for the construction, repair, alteration, or use of structures, equipment or
facilities.
(Ord. 72-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)

necessary in the interest of public safety, health and general welfare, to
adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to interpret and implement the
provisions of NPMC to secure the intent thereof and to designate requirements,

the Mayor a written statement of operations in the form and content as shall be

(Ord. 72-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1331.07  INSPECTIONS.
   (a)    Type of Inspections.
      (1)    Regularly scheduled inspections. All residential rental dwelling
units shall be inspected, where possible, every two years for compliance with
Norwood Property Maintenance Code (NPMC). These inspections shall be completed
before the certificate of use and occupancy required by Section
1331.08(d) can be issued.
      (2)    Owner requested inspections. Upon written request from the owner,
an existing building, structure or premises shall be inspected for compliance
with NPMC. This applies to owner-occupied dwelling units which are not required
to have regularly scheduled inspections and inspections required prior to the
transfer of ownership by Section
1331.08(e).
      (3)    Commercial inspections. Business and industrial establishments,
buildings, structures or premises shall be inspected on a regularly scheduled
basis by fire and health inspectors. Unscheduled inspections shall be made by a
building inspector to assure compliance with NPMC.
      (4)    Inspections for unlawful conditions. The Code Official shall make
or cause to be made an inspection of any existing building, structure, premises
or equipment that he has reason to believe is dangerous, unsanitary or unsafe.
(Ord. 72-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
   (b)    Right of Entry.
      (l)    Access by Code Official. In order to safeguard the safety, health
and welfare of the public, the Code Official is authorized to attempt at any
reasonable time to obtain consent to enter any structure or premises. At no
time shall the Code Official enter any dwelling unit without first obtaining
the written consent of the occupant of that dwelling unit, or a search warrant.
Such occupant shall be informed that entry by the Code Official is sought for
the purpose of making inspections and performing duties under NPMC. If the Code
Official, after a reasonable attempt to obtain consent, does not receive
consent to enter, the Code Official may seek in a court of competent
jurisdiction, a search warrant to allow entry. An owner, occupant or other
person in charge of a dwelling or structure subject to the provisions of NPMC,
who is presented with such search warrant, shall not refuse, impede, inhibit,
interfere with, restrict or obstruct entry and free access to any part of the
structure or premises where an inspection authorized by the search warrant is
sought to be made.
      (2)    Access by owner or operator. Every occupant of a structure or
premises shall give the owner or operator thereof, or agent or employee, access
to any part of such structure or its premises at reasonable times for the
purpose of performing maintenance, repairs or alterations as are necessary to
comply with the provisions of NPMC. For the purposes of this section,
reasonable times shall be defined as any time between the hours of 8:00 a.m.

representative shall disclose proper credentials of their respective office for
the purpose of inspecting any and all buildings and premises in the performance
of duties under NPMC.
      (4)    Coordinated inspections. Whenever in the enforcement of NPMC or
other codes or ordinances the responsibility of more than one City enforcement
official may be involved, it shall be their duty to coordinate their
inspections and administrative orders as fully as practicable so that the
owners and occupants of the structures shall not be subjected to visits by
numerous inspectors nor multiple or conflicting orders. Whenever an inspector
from any agency or department observes an apparent or actual violation of some
provision of some law, ordinance or code of the City, not within his authority
to enforce, he shall report his findings to the official having jurisdiction in
order that such official may institute the necessary corrective measures.
(Ord. 72-1983. Passed 11-22-83.)
1331.08 RESIDENTIAL RENTAL CERTIFICATES.
   (a)   No residential rental unit shall be leased, let, or rented without
obtaining a Residential Rental Certificate. Residential dwelling units occupied
by the owner shall not be required to have a Rental Certificate. A Rental
Certificate shall only be issued to an owner, or a business, or their
designated agent who has provided a current valid street mailing address to the
Department of the Building Commissioner for the receipt of legal notices from
the City. A post office box or similar location may not be used for legal
mailings.
   (b)   The Residential Rental Certificate shall be effective for two years
from the date issued and shall be renewed every two years thereafter.

of a Residential Rental Certificate, the owner or operator of a premises with a
residential rental unit shall have the interior and exterior of the premises,
its structures, and its rental units inspected to verify compliance with the
Property Maintenance Code, Building Code, Health Code, Fire Code, and Zoning
Code.
   (d)   The owner or agent in possession of the Rental Certificates for their
buildings may renew the Residential Rental Certificates by obtaining and
successfully completing re-inspections of the dwelling units and the building's
interior and exterior.
   (e)   If there are no outstanding orders against the owner or agent in
possession of the Residential Rental Certificates and there have been no
violations issued against the property during the effective period of the
Residential Rental Certificates, the owner or agent may request renewal of the
Certificates without reinspection. The request for renewal shall be accompanied

1761.02 LICENSE REQUIRED; APPLICATION.
   (a)    License Required. No person shall sell or offer to sell any licensed
product without first having obtained a license to do so from the Health
Commissioner or their authorized designee.
   (b)    Application. An application for a license to sell licensed products
must be made on a form provided by the Norwood City Health Department. The
application must contain the full name of the applicant, the applicant's
residential and business addresses and telephone numbers, the name of the
business for which the license is sought, and any additional information the
City deems necessary. If the Health Commissioner determines that an application
is incomplete, it will be returned to the applicant with notice of the
information necessary to make the application complete.
   (c)    Term. The license term is one calendar year, beginning on March 1. In
cases of applications for a new license submitted after March 1 of a given year
and more than sixty days before the following March 1, the Health Commissioner
may issue a license for the remainder of the standard term period, but such
license term will only extend to the following last day of February.
   (d)    Revocation or Suspension. Any license issued may be suspended or
revoked following the procedures set forth in this Chapter.
   (e)    Transfers. All licenses issued are valid only on the premises for

issued. The transfer of any license to another location or person is
prohibited.
   (f)    Display. All licenses must be posted and displayed at all times in
plain view of the general public in the retail establishment.
   (g)    Renewals. The renewal of a license issued under this ordinance will
be handled in the same manner as the original application. The request for a
renewal must be made at least thirty days, but no more than sixty days, before
the expiration of the current license on the last day of February.
   (h)    Issuance as Privilege and Not a Right. The issuance of a license is a
privilege and does not entitle the license holder to an automatic renewal of
the license.
   (i)    Instructional Program. Licensees must complete and ensure that all
employees complete a training program on the legal requirements related to the
sale of licensed products and the possible consequences of license violations.
Any training program must be pre-approved by the Norwood Health Commissioner.
Licensees must maintain documentation demonstrating their compliance and must
provide this documentation to the city at the time of renewal, or whenever
requested to do so during the license term.
   (j)    Samples Prohibited. No person shall distribute samples of any
licensed product free of charge or at a nominal cost. The distribution of
licensed products as a free donation is prohibited. (Ord. 51-2021. Passed 9-28-

1761.03 BASIS FOR DENIAL OF LICENSE. 
   (a)    Grounds for denying the issuance or renewal of a license include, but
are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    The applicant is under twenty-one years of age.
      (2)    The applicant has been convicted within the past five years of any
violation of a federal, state, or local law, ordinance provision, or other

      (5)    The applicant is prohibited by federal, state, or other local law,
ordinance, or other regulation from holding a license.

place of business. Only fixed-location retail establishments are eligible to be
licensed.
   (b)    If a license is mistakenly issued or renewed to a person, the Norwood
Health Commissioner may revoke the license upon the discovery that the person
was ineligible for the license under this chapter. The Norwood Health
Commissioner will provide the license holder with notice of the revocation,
along with information on the right to appeal.

issued photographic identification containing the bearer's date of birth that
the purchaser is at least twenty-one years of age. Verification is not required
for a person over the age of thirty. That the person appeared to be thirty
years of age or older does not constitute a defense to a violation of this
subsection.
      (2)    Signage. Notice of the legal sales age, age verification
requirement, and possible penalties for underage sales must be posted

that is clearly visible to anyone who is or is considering making a purchase.

manner or form prohibited by federal, state, or other local law, ordinance
provision, or other regulation.
