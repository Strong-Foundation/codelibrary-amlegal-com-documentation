Municipality of a permanent and general nature should be recodified, and
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.

   SECTION 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in

enacted prior to August 1, 1990, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

or resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section contains
new material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance.
   SECTION 5. That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance the
Mayor and Clerk-Treasurer shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Wellington, 1990.

necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, welfare and safety
for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and

law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
FOR THE MUNICIPALITY OF
WELLINGTON, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the People of the Village of Wellington, in the County of Lorain, and
State of Ohio, in order that we may have the benefits of Municipal Home Rule
and may exercise all powers of local self-government, do frame and adopt this
Charter for the government of the Village of Wellington.
ARTICLE I
NAME; BOUNDARIES; CORPORATE POWERS
1.01 Name and Boundary
The present Municipality, known as the Village of Wellington, Ohio, shall
continue to be a body politic and corporate, under the name of the Village of
Wellington, regardless of its population; the provisions of this Charter shall

until Council provides a different manner of exercising the powers.
1.04 Construction of Powers
The powers of the Village under this Charter shall be construed liberally in
favor of the Village, and the specific mention of particular powers in the
Charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers stated
in this Article or as may otherwise exist under the Constitution and laws of
Ohio.
ARTICLE II
COUNCIL
2.01 Powers of Council
All legislative power of the Village shall be vested in the Council except as
otherwise provided by this Charter or the Constitution of the State of Ohio.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the Council shall have and possess the
following powers:
   (A)   The power to levy taxes and assessments and incur debts subject to the
limitations imposed thereon by this Charter and the Constitution of Ohio.
   (B)   The power to adopt and to provide for the enforcement of local police,
sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with the general
laws.
   (C)   The power to provide for the exercise of all powers of local self-
government granted to the Village by the Constitution of the State of Ohio in a
manner not inconsistent with this Charter or the Constitution of the State of
Ohio.
   (D)   The power, by ordinance or resolution, to establish or authorize the
number of officers and employees in the various offices, departments,
divisions, bureaus, boards and commissions of the Village and to establish or
authorize the establishment of the rate of their compensation, hours of work,
and to provide such other fringe benefits and conditions of employment as
deemed proper by the Council.
   (E)   The power to approve the employment or appointment of officers or
employees of the Village where the same has otherwise been set forth in this
Charter.
   (F)   The power to require such bonds as in the opinion of the Council are
necessary for the faithful discharge of the duties of the officers and
employees of the Village. The premium for said bonds shall be paid by the
Village.
   (G)   Except as may be expressly provided by this Charter, the power to
create, combine, change and abolish other offices, departments, divisions,

   (K)   To exercise all other powers granted to the Council by this Charter
and by the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio.
2.02 Composition and Term
The Council shall be composed of six members all of whom shall be elected at
large. All terms shall be for four (4) years. The salary of any Council member
shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which the member was
elected or appointed; provided, however, that this does not prohibit the
payment of any increased costs of continuing to provide the identical benefits
provided to a member at the commencement of the member's term of office.
(Amended 11-8-16)
2.03 Qualifications for Council Members
   (A)   Each member of the Council shall have been for at least one year prior
to the member’s election or appointment, and during the member’s term of office
shall continue to be, a resident of this Municipality and a qualified elector
thereof. A member of Council shall not hold any other elected public office or
be employed by or hold any other office in this Municipality, except that a
member may serve in any position as an authorized or designated representative
of the Council or this Municipality on any board, commission, or other
governmental entity, and except that a member is not prevented from serving in
the State Militia or Reserve Corps of the United States, or as a Notary Public,
or as an official of a political party. A sitting member of Council shall not
serve on the Charter Review Commission. No member of Council shall be
interested in the profits or emoluments of any contract, job, work or service
for which monies of the Municipality are or will be expended. Any member of
Council who shall cease to possess any of the qualifications enumerated herein
shall forfeit the member’s office; but failure to maintain such qualifications
shall not render void or ineffective any action of Council in which such member
has participated.
   (B)   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualification of
its members. The Council, by two-thirds vote of all the members elected, may
expel any member who ceases to possess any of the qualifications stated in this
section or who, without valid excuse, is absent for four successive regular
meetings. No such expulsion shall take place until the delinquent member has
been notified of the charge against him and has had an opportunity to be heard.
2.04 Council Vacancies
   (A)   Whenever a vacancy in the position of Council member has been brought
to the attention of the Clerk, the Clerk shall publish a Notice in a newspaper
of general circulation within the Municipality, giving Notice that a vacancy
exists and that persons interested in filling the vacancy may submit written
application to the Clerk. The Notice shall be published once a week for two
consecutive weeks. The Notice shall indicate that the remaining members of
Council shall be eligible to fill the vacancy at any time which is at least
thirty days following the first publication of Notice (the “Council Appointment
Date”) and that interested persons must submit their written application at
least three business days prior to the Council Appointment Date to be
considered eligible for appointment.
   (B)   At any time thirty days after the Clerk has first published the Notice
described in paragraph (A), a vacancy in the Council shall be filled by a
majority vote of the remaining members of the Council. The Council may consider
any eligible candidate for the position and may consider such qualifications as
it deems proper.
   (C)   Council Vacancies. If the vacancy occurs more than forty days before
the next regular municipal election (held in an odd-numbered year), a successor
shall be elected at that election for the unexpired term unless the unexpired
term ends within one year immediately following the date of that election, in
which case an election to fill the unexpired term shall not be held and the
person appointed or elected under division (B) of this section shall hold the
office for the unexpired term. If an election is held under this division, the
person so elected shall take office on the first day of January following that
election, and the person temporarily appointed shall hold the office until that
time.
(Amended 11-8-16)
   (D)   If the Council shall fail to elect a person to fill a vacancy in the
Council under paragraph (B) of this Section within forty-five (45) days after
the Clerk has first published the Notice described in paragraph (A), its power
to do so shall lapse and the Mayor shall appoint a person to serve for the time
as provided in paragraph (C).
2.05 Clerk of Council
Effective from and after April 1, 2012, the Council may appoint, by a majority
vote of its current members, a person to serve as the Clerk of Council. The
Clerk of Council shall serve at the pleasure of the Council and may be removed
without cause by a majority vote of the current members of Council. The Clerk
of Council may hold another office or position of employment in the Village.
The Clerk of Council shall have those powers, duties and functions as are
provided in this Charter, by the Rules of Council or by ordinance or
resolution. Included in the duties of the Clerk of Council shall be the
maintenance of a record of proceedings of the Council and its committees and a
record of all ordinances and resolutions adopted by the Council; these and all
records of the Municipality shall, at a minimum, be made available to the
public in accordance with the requirements and limitations under State and
Federal law; and, in addition and to the extent permitted by funding made
available by Council, the Clerk shall make available to the public by
electronic means either the minutes of the Council and its committees or actual
recordings of their proceedings. The Clerk of Council shall give notice of
regular and special meetings of the Council to its members and to the public as
may be provided by this Charter, the Rules of Council or by ordinance or
resolution. The Clerk of Council shall be subject to the control of the
President of the Council. The Council, by ordinance or resolution, may require
the Clerk of Council to serve as the secretary of one or more boards and
commissions provided for under this Charter.
The Council may also elect to appoint one or more Assistant Clerks of Council
who shall serve at the pleasure of the Council and may be removed without cause
by a majority vote of the current members of Council. (Amended 11-18-16)
2.06 President Pro Tempore
   (a)   At its organizational meeting in each year the Council shall elect
from among its members a president pro tempore by a majority vote of its
current members. The President pro tempore of the Council shall exercise the
powers, duties and functions of the Mayor in the event of the temporary absence
or disability of the Mayor. The President pro tempore shall continue as a
member of Council and may vote on any matter before the Council while acting as
Mayor, but may not vote a second time on any matter in order to break a tie
vote.
   (b)   A permanent vacancy in the office of Mayor shall be filled by the
President pro tempore of the Council to serve for the unexpired term or until
the beginning of the term of the successor duly elected and qualified. Such
successor Mayor shall be elected to the office for the unexpired term, at the
first regular municipal election (held in an odd-numbered year), that occurs
more than forty days after the vacancy has occurred; except that when the
unexpired term ends within one year immediately following the date of such
election, an election to fill the unexpired term shall not be held and the
President pro tempore of the Council shall serve in the office for the balance
of the unexpired term. If an election is so held, the President pro tempore may
be a candidate to succeed himself as Mayor. If an election is so held, the
person elected shall take office on the first day of January following
election.
   (c)   In the event that the President pro tempore fills a permanent vacancy
in the office of Mayor, a majority of the remaining members of Council shall
select a new President pro tempore from among the remaining members of Council,
and shall proceed to fill the vacancy on the Council. (Amended 11-8-16.)
2.07 Council Meetings
   (A)   The Council shall determine, by a majority vote of its current
members, the frequency, dates and times of regular meetings in order to
properly conduct its business, but it shall hold at least two regular meetings
in each month in at least ten months of each year.
   (B)    Special meetings of the Council may be called, for any purpose, by
the Mayor or any three members of the Council upon at least twenty-four hours
notice to the Mayor and each member of the Council, which notice may be served
personally or left at the usual place of residence. In the event the Mayor or
any three members of the Council determine an emergency exists, the twenty-four
hour notice shall not apply. Members of the Council and the Mayor who attend
special meetings of the Council or who are present at another regular or
special meeting where a special meeting is announced by the presiding officer
need not receive notice of the special meeting. Members of the Council and the
Mayor may waive receipt of notice of a special meeting either prior or
subsequent to the meeting.
   (C)   Any regular or special meeting of the Council may be adjourned or
recessed to another time, date or place without giving the notice required in
Division (B) of this Section.
   (D)   All meetings of the Council, its Committees and other Boards and
Commissions of the Municipality shall be held in accordance with the general
laws of Ohio pertaining to requirements for open meetings of public bodies.
2.08 Council Organization and Rules
The Council shall be a continuing body, but shall meet in the Council Chamber
at its first meeting in January of each year for the purpose of organization.
Council shall adopt, by majority vote of its current members, its own Rules
which shall not conflict with this Charter and which shall remain in effect
until amended, changed or repealed by a majority vote of the current members of
Council. The Rules shall go into immediate effect unless a later date is
specified, and shall not be subject to initiative or referendum. The Rules of
Council shall provide for the number, composition and manner of appointment of
committees of Council, and such other matters, as Council shall determine to be
necessary for the proper functioning and government of Council.
2.09 Action by Council
   (A)   A quorum of Council, or of any of its committees, shall consist of a
majority of the current members of that body.
   (B)   Action of Council shall be by ordinance, resolution or motion. Motion
shall be used to conduct the business of Council, in procedural matters, for
elections conducted among and appointments made by Council members, to provide
directions to and to make requests of administrative officers and employees and
members of Boards and Commissions, and as otherwise provided in this Charter.
All other action shall be taken by ordinance or resolution. No action of
Council shall be invalidated merely because the form thereof fails to comply
with the provisions of this Section.
   (C)   Any member of Council or the Administration may introduce any
ordinance or resolution, at a regular or special meeting, which shall be in
written or printed form and shall contain a concise title. Zoning ordinances or
resolutions may be introduced in the manner as Council may prescribe by
ordinance or resolution.
2.10 Ordinances and Resolutions
   (A)    Form. The form and style of ordinances and resolutions shall be
determined by the Rules of Council. Each ordinance or resolution shall contain
only one subject, which shall be expressed in its title, provided that
appropriation ordinances may contain the various subjects, accounts and amounts
for which monies are appropriated, and that ordinances and resolutions which
are codified or recodified are not subject to the limitation of containing one
subject.
   (B)   Readings. Each ordinance and resolution shall be read by title only on
three separate days, unless this requirement is dispensed with by a vote of at
least three-fourths of the current members of the Council. Readings shall be by
title only, unless a majority of the Council shall request that any ordinance
or resolution be read in full. Copies of each ordinance and resolution shall be
available for public inspection at the meetings of the Council at which the
ordinance or resolution is considered. A pending ordinance or resolution may be
amended at any time prior to its passage by the Council by a majority vote of
the current members of the Council present and voting on the amendment, and
such amendment shall not require additional readings of the ordinance or
resolution.
   (C)   Voting. The vote on the question of passage of each ordinance,
resolution and motion shall be taken by a roll call of members to be entered on
the Journal, or other record of proceedings of the Council, and none shall be

affirmative vote, but receives the necessary majority for passage as
nonemergency legislation, it shall become effective as non- emergency
legislation. A member who is present at a meeting who does not register a
negative vote on a matter being voted upon shall be held to have acquiesced in
the action take by a majority of those who do vote.

preservation of the public peace, health, safety or welfare, and shall contain

   1.   Each ordinance and resolution shall be authenticated by the signature
of the Clerk of Council. The failure or refusal to sign shall not invalidate an
otherwise properly enacted ordinance or resolution.
   2.   The Clerk of Council shall promptly present each adopted ordinance or
resolution to the Mayor for the Mayor’s approval or disapproval. The Mayor may
approve or disapprove the whole or any part of any resolution or ordinance
appropriating money, but otherwise the Mayor’s approval or disapproval shall be
addressed to the entire resolution or ordinance. If the Mayor approves such
legislation, the Mayor shall sign it and file it with the Clerk of Council. If
the Mayor disapproves such legislation, or any item of such legislation
appropriating money, the Mayor shall file it, together with the Mayor’s
objections, in writing, with the Clerk of Council; the objections shall

effect notwithstanding the disapproval of the Mayor.

resolutions of the Village, may be amended by the passage of subsequent

enact new or supplemental sections or parts thereto; or repeal existing
sections or parts thereof. This paragraph does not prevent repeals by
implication.

Commission with respect to zoning within the Village and other land use
regulations and matters, including but not limited to: public hearings; notices

Revised Code will apply. A concurring vote of at least two-thirds of the
current membership of Council shall be necessary to pass any zoning ordinance

considered as having passed unless said amendment receives at least a majority
vote of the current members of Council.

reference. The ordinance or resolution adopting any such standard ordinance or
code shall make reference to the date and source of such standard ordinance or
code without reproducing the same at length in the ordinance or resolution. In
such cases, publication of the standard ordinance or code shall not be
required, but at least one copy of such code shall be kept at all times in the
office of the Clerk of Council and available for reference by interested
persons. If the standard ordinance or code is amended after its adoption by
reference by the Council, it shall be deemed to have been adopted.
   (K)   Codification. By a majority vote of the members of Council, the
Council may cause the ordinances and resolutions of the Village to be revised,
codified, recodified, rearranged, or published in book form.
   (L)   Publication. Publication of Ordinances and Resolutions shall be

authorize publication at a later date.

Commission shall be elected. The Charter Review Commission shall consist of
eleven electors of the Village, elected to serve for a term of one year,
beginning on January 1 of the year following their election ending on December
31, of the same year as the term commences. Notwithstanding any specification
or restriction otherwise set forth in this Charter for current elected or
appointed officers or employees, a candidate-elector, other than a current
member of Council, shall not be disqualified from election to the Charter
Review Commission because the candidate-elector is or will be serving as an

before or during the term of the Charter Review Commission.
   1.   Members of the Charter Review Commission shall be elected upon a ballot
bearing no party designation. The ballot shall have printed or written thereon
all electors who have been lawfully nominated and such directions as will aid
the elector, as “Vote for not more than eleven” and the like, and certification
of the election officers upon the back of the ballot as prescribed by law. The
eleven electors receiving the largest number of votes for members of the
Commission shall constitute the Charter Review Commission.
   2.   All nominations for members of the Commission shall be made by
nomination papers signed by not less than fifteen persons eligible to vote at
regular municipal elections, and the nomination papers shall be filed with the
Board of Elections of Lorain County at least ninety days before the election.
   3.   The ballots shall be printed so as to give each elector a clear
opportunity to designate his choice of candidates. Provisions shall be made on
the ballot to allow the voter to write in the name or names of any person or
persons not printed on the ballot for whom he desires to vote; provided,
however, that any write-in candidate must comply with the requirements of State
law pertaining to declaration of candidacy and the time requirements therefor,
in order to be eligible for election to the Commission.
   In the event of any vacancy on the Charter Review Commission, the Mayor may
appoint a Member to fill the vacancy for the balance of the term of the current
Charter Review Commission. (Amended 11-8-16)
   (B)    The Commission shall review the provisions of the Charter and shall
make written recommendations, if any, to the Council for revisions to the
Charter. The Council shall cause the recommendations to be submitted to a vote
of the electors by way of Charter amendment.
   (C)    The Council shall appropriate sufficient funds for the operation and
expenses of the Charter Review Commission.
ARTICLE VII
NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS
7.01 Nominations
Nominations for all elected offices of the Village shall be made by non-
partisan petition only and no primary election shall be held to nominate
officers of the Village. Nominating petitions shall be in the form determined
by the election authorities provided under the general laws of Ohio, provided
that the signatures of twenty-five (25) registered voters shall be required for
any nomination to any elected office. Members of Council shall be elected at
large. The fact that nomination is made by non-partisan petition shall not
prevent any candidate from announcing his party membership to the public,
subject to the provisions of any applicable state or federal laws.
7.02 Regular Municipal Elections
The regular municipal elections for all elected offices, and for issues to be
presented to the voters, shall be held on the dates and at the times fixed by
the election laws of Ohio for general statutory plan cities, except that all
such offices shall be elected to terms of office as provided in this Charter.
7.03 Special Elections
The Council may, at any time, order a special election by ordinance or
resolution which shall set forth the date and purpose of the election,
including but not limited to the referral of pending ordinances and resolutions
to the electors for their approval or rejection. Special elections may be held
on any date, including but not limited to the dates of general and primary
elections in odd or even numbered years.
7.04 Conduct of Elections
All regular and special elections shall be conducted by the election officials
as established under the laws of Ohio. Such elections shall be held in

INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL
8.01 Initiative and Referendum
Ordinances, resolutions, issues and other measures may be proposed by
initiative petition and adopted by election, and ordinances and resolutions
adopted by the Council shall be subject to referendum, as provided by the
Constitution and laws of Ohio, provided ordinances and resolutions calling

8.02 Recall
   (A)    The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall
election any elected official of the Village in the manner provided in this
Section.
   (B)    If the elected official shall have served six months of his or her
term, an elector or electors of the Village may serve written notice upon the
Clerk of Council of their intent to circulate petitions for the recall of a
named elected official or officials. No petitions for the recall of an elected
official may be circulated until such written notice of intent is served upon
the Clerk of Council. Not later than thirty days after service of such notice
of intent on the Clerk of Council such persons may file, with the Clerk of
Council, a petition demanding the removal of an elected official. Separate
petitions shall be filed for each elected official sought to be removed by
recall. The Clerk shall note thereon the name and address of the person filing
the petition and the date of such filing, and deliver to such person a receipt
therefore and attach a copy thereof to said petition. Such petition may be
circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and office of the
person whose removal is sought. Such petition shall be signed by at least that
number of electors which equals 25% in number of the electors voting at the
last preceding regular municipal election.
   (C)    Within ten days after the day on which such petition is filed, the
Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets the requirements
hereof. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, the Clerk
shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is insufficient,
deliver a copy of the certificate to the person who filed the petition and make
a record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of ten days
after the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition
sufficient. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, the
Clerk shall promptly so certify to Council and shall deliver a copy of such
certificate to the person whose removal is sought within five days and make a
record of such delivery.
   (D)    If the person whose removal is sought shall not resign within five
days after the day on which the Clerk's certificate shall have been delivered,
Council shall, by ordinance or resolution, fix a day for holding a recall
election, which date shall not be less than ninety days nor more than one
hundred twenty days after the date of the Clerk's certification of sufficiency
to the Council, and shall cause notice of such recall election to be published
on the same day of each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village. At such recall election, this question
shall be placed upon the ballot: “Shall (naming the person whose removal is
sought) be allowed to continue as (naming the office),” with the provision on
the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively. In the event of a majority
of the vote is negative, such person shall be removed, the office shall be
vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. If the
person is not removed at such recall election, no further recall petitions
shall be filed against him or her for a period of one year following such
election.
(Amended 11-8-16)

with the requirements of State law.
   (C)   In addition to any remedies available under the provisions of State
law, any person aggrieved by the failure to comply with the provisions of this
Section may submit a complaint to the Law Director. The Law Director is
empowered to investigate any such complaint and is authorized to institute
legal action against any officer or employee to compel compliance with this
Section.
9.02 Contracting Powers and Procedures
   (A)    The Manager shall be the contracting officer of this Municipality
and, unless otherwise required by federal or state law or ordinance, shall
award and execute all contracts within the purview of the position of Manager
on behalf of the Village, and shall report all expenditures to the Council.
   (B)    When any expenditure or contract is anticipated to be for a sum in
excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), such contract or expenditure
shall be authorized or directed by an ordinance or resolution passed by the
Council, shall be advertised once a week for at least two weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Village, and shall be entered into with the
lowest and best bidder. The Manager shall not divide any order or contract to
avoid the requirements of competitive bidding. When it becomes necessary to
make alterations or modifications in connection with any work or improvements
covered by such a contract, they shall be made only upon the order of the
Manager. No such order shall be effective until the price to be paid for the
work or material, or both, under the altered or modified contract, shall have
been agreed upon in writing and signed by the contractor and the Manager on
behalf of the Village. Modifications or alterations in contracts shall not
require advertising and competitive bidding. The requirements set forth in this
paragraph shall not be applicable to any contract or expenditure for which
advertising and competitive bidding would not be required under provisions of
either statute or common law of Ohio, as would pertain to an Ohio statutory
city. (Amended 11-8-16)
   (C)    No contract, agreement or other contractual obligation involving the
expenditure of money shall be entered into or authorized by the Manager unless
the Director of Finance or his or her duly authorized representative shall
first certify:
   1.   That the money required for such contract, agreement, obligation or
expenditure is in the Village's treasury or in the process of collection
thereto, and
   2.   That the money has been appropriated by Council for the purpose of the
contract, which may be included in a general description of purpose, and it
remains unencumbered.
Without the certification, contractual obligations shall be unenforceable
against the Village unless subsequently authorized by the Council by a majority
vote of its members.
9.03 Removal of Officials
   (A)    Elected officials and members of Boards and Commissions may be
removed for Good Cause as provided in this Section of the Charter.
   (B)    As used in this Section of the Charter, the “Charging Official” shall
mean: the “Mayor,” except, where the person accused of a ground for removal is
the person holding the office of Mayor, the “President Pro-Tempore of Council.”
   (C)    The Charging Official, if he or she has reason to believe there is
Good Cause (as defined in this Section of the Charter) for the removal of an
elected official or member of a Board or Commission, may determine to proceed
with the filing of formal charges against the official or member, in which case
the Charging Official shall give notice of the alleged cause for removal and
the time, date, and place of the commencement of hearing for removal, which
shall not be earlier than ten days after the service of the notice to the
accused person by personal service, certified mail, or by leaving a copy of
such notice at the person’s last known place of residence in the Village. At
such time, date, and place, the Council shall hear, provide an opportunity to
the accused person to be represented by legal counsel and to be heard and
present defenses, and shall determine whether the accused person shall be
removed from his or her office. Council may adjourn its meeting to one or more
subsequent dates and continue the hearings or its deliberations from day to
day. The Council shall have the authority and may remove an official for any of
the following Good Causes by a two-thirds vote of the members of the Council,
provided that if the accused person is a member of Council, such person shall
not be counted in determining required majorities:
   1.   Absences for reasons within the control of the officer or member from
any three consecutive regular meetings of the Council or the Board or
Commission on which such person serves or absence for any reason from any six
regular or special meetings thereof in any calendar year provided the accused
person received notice of special meetings.
   2.    Failure to possess or maintain the qualifications of the office.
   3.   A determination that the accused person is guilty of misfeasance,
malfeasance or nonfeasance in office.
   4.    Conviction of a crime that is a felony.
   (D)    Upon the removal of an official or member from office pursuant to
this Section, the office of the offending person shall be vacant, subject to
any appeal to and review by an appropriate court, and the vacancy shall be
filled as provided in this Charter.
   (E)    The removal of an official member or the occurrence of any of the
Good Causes permitting the removal shall not invalidate any action of the
official or any body, including the Council, in which the member participated.
The subsequent removal of a person who fills a vacancy created pursuant to this
Section by the reinstatement by a court of a person previously removed by the
Council, shall not invalidate any action of the person who filled the vacancy
or any body, including the Council, in which such person who filled the vacancy
participated.
   (F)    The Council shall be the judge of the qualifications of and of the
grounds for removal from office and shall conduct the proceedings relative to
removal. The Council shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, administer
oaths and require the production of evidence, either on its own motion or
through the process of any appropriate court or officer thereof. A person
charged with conduct constituting Good Cause for removal from office shall be
entitled to a public hearing. A record of the proceedings shall be made and
preserved. Decisions made by the Council under this Section shall be subject to
review by the Courts on matters of law and whether the Council acted
arbitrarily and without probative evidence to support the grounds for removal.

Law shall prosecute the removal proceedings before the Council and any review

liable by any court of competent jurisdiction. All contracts entered into by
the Village or for its benefit prior to the effective date of this Charter
shall continue in full force and effect.
9.06 Effect of Charter on Existing Laws and Rights

of the Village, nor any right, liability, pending suit or prosecution, either

granted by the Village nor pending proceedings for the authorization of public
improvements or the levy of assessments therefor. Except as a contrary intent

   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which

subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   (d)   With respect to these Codified Ordinances, any pay ordinance or
resolution, or any practice or procedure, adopted by Council, whether presently
existing or hereinafter enacted, it shall be deemed the intention of Council
and the policy of the Village employee, is intended to be only descriptive of
the rate of pay for a position, and not a limitation upon the actual total
amount of wages which may be earned by an individual in the course of a
calendar year, nor a limitation on the actual total amount of wages which may
be paid to an individual for performing services in a prior calendar year as an
employee of the Village.
(Ord. 1998-39. Passed 11-16-98.)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

following order:
      (1)   Roll Call;
      (2)   Reading and disposal of minutes of preceding meeting;
      (3)   Payment of bills and expenses;
      (4)   Reports and communications from the Mayor, directors of departments
and other Municipal officers;
      (5)   Communications, petitions;
      (6)   Reports of committees;
      (7)   Approval of bonds, contracts, plats;
      (8)   Ordinances and resolutions;
      (9)   Appointments and confirmations;
      (10)   Miscellaneous;
      (11)   Adjourn.
   (b)   The presiding officer may at any time permit a member of Council to
introduce an ordinance, motion or resolution out of the regular order for the

   Every member present shall vote on any question on the call of the yeas and
nays, unless excused by the unanimous consent of Council, and any member not

being taken, shall be deemed guilty of contempt of Council, and may for such
contempt be censured by a majority of Council.
Rule 9 - Legislation.
   (a)    When ordinances and resolutions are to be prepared by the Law
Director , a request shall be submitted to the Law Director by the person so
requesting. When they are prepared, they shall be given a first reading and
referred to the committee concerned with the subject matter of the ordinance or
resolution. The committee will then report the ordinance or resolution at the
next Council meeting. Committees may also report ordinances or resolutions for
first hearing. Each member of Council shall be furnished with a complete copy
of any ordinance or resolution introduced.
   (b)    Council may accept or reject any committee report, in whole or in
part. The Law Director has the responsibility of preparing legislation in the
manner prescribed by law. The committees to which legislation is referred shall
not concern themselves with the fulfillment of legal requirements. They will
only determine whether the subject matter has been fully covered. Example: The
Finance Committee may request certain salary adjustments be made. Council may
approve the request and vote to have the necessary legislation prepared by the
Law Director. The legislation at first hearing would be referred to the Finance
Committee to determine whether all of the adjustments are included. Members and
committees may prepare ordinances but they must be approved by the Law Director
as to form before the third reading or a vote for passage.
(Ord. 2010-45. Passed 12-20-10.)

the time of the second reading. In the event that the measure fails to receive
approval by a majority, the measure shall be considered to have been tabled.
   (d)    After three separate readings, the ordinance or resolution shall be
ready for passage. A member then moves for its passage and a final vote is
taken. If a majority approves the legislation, it shall be signed by the Clerk
and presiding officer and shall take effect as provided by law. The Clerk shall
record each vote by yeas and nays and enter the same upon the journal.
(Ord. 2012-06. Passed 4-2-12.) 
Rule 10 - Suspension of the Rules.
   If an ordinance or resolution is presented to Council requiring immediate
action, the presiding officer should entertain a motion to suspend the rules.
If three-fourths of the members approve the motion, the Clerk shall record such
vote by yeas and nays on the journal and further readings thereof shall be
dispensed with. The legislation shall then be ready for passage.
   After a member moves for passage a vote will be taken by yeas and nays and
recorded by the Clerk. If a majority of Council approves the passage of the

approval.

effect immediately upon passage.

shall take effect immediately upon passage.

reported upon within two weeks from the time of reference, such matter shall be
brought by the Clerk to the attention of Council, which shall take such further
action as it may deem best.
Rule 13 - Reference to Committees.
   Any report, resolution, ordinance or matter before Council for
consideration, except appropriation ordinances, before their final passage may
be referred either to the standing committee to which the subject matter is
most closely related, or to a committee specially appointed by the presiding
officer. Any such committee shall consider the matter thus referred to it and
report thereon to Council without unnecessary delay.
Rule 14 - Robert's Rules of Order.
   In the absence of any rule upon the matter of business, Council shall be
governed by "Robert's Rules of Order."
Rule 15 - Motions: Order of Preference.
   When a question or proposition is before Council, or under debate, no motion
shall be received except the following:

all of which shall be decided without debate.

(Ord. 2012-13. Passed 5-7-12.)
   (b)   The percentage of change in the Cost of Living Index shall only be
applied to the Base Rate of Pay as set forth in the table above and not to any
employee’s current rate of pay computed as the result of the application of
prior Cost of Living Adjustments so as to avoid compounding of increases or
decreases.
   (c)   Should the change in the Cost of Living Index exceed 5% in any 12
month period affecting these employees, only the first 5% change shall be
applied in full to the Base Rate of Pay with half (50%) of the next 5% of

Changes after completion of eight (8) years under this ordinance. Thereafter on
each tenth anniversary of this enactment similar adjustments in the Base Rates
of Compensation shall be made with the adjusted Base Rate reflecting in each
case the current rate of pay in each category as it existed two years prior to
such anniversary date.

any year, the Cost of Living Adjustment shall be adjusted or eliminated if the
Council, by majority vote, declares, prior to the first regular pay date in
April of that year, that any Cost of Living increase which would normally be
awarded for that year shall either be eliminated or reduced, as Council may
designate, for that year.
 
   (f)   Nothing in the foregoing provisions shall be construed to restrain or
restrict the authority of any future Council to alter, amend, or repeal the
structure of Cost of Living pay increases provided herein.
(Ord. 2004-09. Passed 4-5-04.)
 
159.08  REEMPLOYMENT OF RETIREES.
   Notwithstanding any other ordinance or any provision of the Village’s
Employee Handbook to the contrary:
   (a)   Any individual who retires from employment with the Village of
Wellington shall, to the extent otherwise permitted by State law, be eligible
for appointment to any position within the Village of Wellington along with any
other member of the public at large.
   (b)   An individual who retires from employment with the Village of
Wellington shall not, by that fact alone, be entitled to any preference by the
appointing authority in consideration of applicants for any position. If an
individual applies for appointment to the same position from which he retired,
that fact shall not prevent the appointing authority from accepting
applications from the public at large; however, the appointing authority may
consider that individual’s prior experience in determining the best qualified
candidate for a position.
   (c)   Except to the extent specifically required by State law, an individual
who retires from the Village of Wellington and is subsequently hired by the
Village shall be considered as a “new hire,” and shall be eligible for pay
rates and benefits that would accrue to any other new hire, without
consideration for prior years service.

regulations adopted by Council.
      (Ord. 2004-64. Passed 12-20-04.)
181.03 DETERMINATION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village of Wellington shall be considered as
having a taxable situs in the Village of Wellington for purposes of income
taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village of Wellington during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village of Wellington to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village of Wellington to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales,
and services, wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in this subsection, “Sales made in the Village of Wellington”
mean:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Wellington regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within such Village.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Wellington regard less of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside such Village if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the Village of Wellington and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of Wellington to purchasers outside such Village
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place were delivery is made.
   (c)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year,
beginning with the year 2005, apportioned to the Municipality may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years apportioned to the
Municipality, until exhausted, but in no event for more than the three (3)
taxable years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No
portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of
any prior year. The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be
apportioned to the Municipality in the same manner as provided here in for
apportioning net profits to the Municipality. The net operating loss of a
taxpayer that loses its legal identity, by any means such as a merger or
consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carryforward loss deduction to the
surviving or new taxpayer. The net operating loss sustained by a business or
profession is not deductible from employee earnings. However, if a taxpayer is
engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included in the same
return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity (except any
portion of a loss reportable for municipal income tax purposes to another
municipality) may be used to offset the profits of another for purposes of
arriving at overall net profits.

basis, to deduct from compensation paid to such employee subject to this
chapter at the time of such payment, the tax imposed in Section

compensation due by said employer to said employee.
   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, when, an
employer within the Village of Wellington employs a Village of Wellington
resident in another taxing municipality which requires the employer to deduct
the tax from such taxing municipality from the Wellington resident employed
there, such employer shall withhold and remit to the Village of Wellington the
difference, if any, between the tax imposed by such other taxing municipality
and the tax imposed by this chapter or shall withhold Wellington tax on one
hundred percent (100%) of the income subject to Wellington tax if the
Wellington resident/employee is employed in a location which does not impose
municipal tax. (Ord. 2004-64. Passed 12-20-04.)

   (e)   The officer or employee having control or supervision or charged with
the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment, shall be
personally liable for failure to file the return and making the payment, or pay
the taxes, penalty and interest due as required herein. The dissolution,

officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of suck business to file
a return or pay taxes and penalty and interest due.
(Ord. 2004-64. Passed 12-20-04.)
 
   (f)   On or before January 31 following any calendar year such employer
shall file with the Director of Finance an information return for each employee
along with an annual reconciliation form from whom the income tax has been or
should have been withheld, showing the name, address and social security number
of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during the year and the
amount of the municipal income tax withheld from such employee. The information
return shall include all of the information required to be reported to the
Internal Revenue Service by the employer on a W-2 Form. At the time of filing
this return, the employer shall pay over any amount deducted or which should
have been deducted or withheld during the preceding year but which was not
remitted.
   (g)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others who are
required under the Internal Revenue Code to furnish forms 1099 to IRS for

Finance or in lieu thereof, a listing containing the same information as
required by IRS on the 1099s on or before the due date for such forms 1099 as
established by IRS. Failure to provide the foregoing information will result in
any deduction for payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's tax return to
be disallowed. (Ord. 2012-13. Passed 5-7-12.)
      (1)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Village bears to the total number of
working days employed within and outside the Village.
      (2)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because of the peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or the unusual
basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts
and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (3)   The occasional entry into the Village of a nonresident employee who
performs the duties for which he is employed entirely outside the Village, but
enters the Village for the purpose of reporting, receiving instructions,
accounting, etc., incidental to his duties outside the Village, shall not be
deemed to take such employee out of the class of those rendering their service
entirely outside the Village.

made to an employee on account of commissions where such advances are in excess
of commissions earned.
 
   (i)   An employer, required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expense
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services, provided, that such expense must be of the kind and in the amount
recognized and allowed as deductible expense for Federal income tax purposes.
 
   (j)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.
 
   (k)   Commissions and fees paid to professional men, brokers, and others who
are independent contractors and not employees of the payor are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.02.
 
   (l)   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the
Village, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall not
relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with this
chapter respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes.
 
   (m)   The requirements of this section shall apply to any nonresident
employer, or to the agent of such a nonresident employer, or to any other
nonresident payer, who pays an individual any item included in the taxable
income of that individual employee or payee, if the total amount of tax
required to be deducted and withheld for the Village on account of all of the
employer's employees or payer's payees exceeds one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) for the calendar year. Once an employer or payee has begun
withholding taxes pursuant to this subsection, it shall continue to do so
unless, for a period of three consecutive calendar years, the total amount of
taxes withheld by the employer or payee for the benefit of the Village has not
exceeded one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) in each of those calendar years;
notwithstanding the foregoing, an employer or payee will again be required to
comply with this section is, in any subsequent year, the total amount of tax
required to be deducted and withheld again exceeds one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).

taxable income by this Chapter is allowed for any municipal income taxes on the
same taxable income paid by a resident of Wellington to another municipality.
(Ord. 2004-64. Passed 12-20-04.)
181.17 SAVING CLAUSE.
   This chapter shall be construed so as to maximize the amount of tax which is
applicable and payable, consistent with the provisions of Chapter 718 of the
Ohio Revised Code as it may, from time to time be amended. Nevertheless, this
chapter shall not apply to any person, firm, corporation, or to any property as
to whom or which, it is beyond the power of Council to impose the tax herein
provided for. Any sentence, clause, section or part of this Chapter, or any tax
against or exception granted any individual or any of the several groups of
persons, or forms of income specified herein is found to be unconstitutional or
illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity shall
affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this chapter and shall
not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses,
sections or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the
intention of Council of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence or part thereof,
not been included therein.
(Ord. 2004-64. Passed 12-20-04.)

   All delinquent tax accounts outsourced by the Village to a law firm or

equal to the fee charged by each law firm or collection agency as set forth in
the collection contract with the Village. The balance due prior to the
assessment of the collection fee shall be the principal balance due plus
interest, penalties, late fees, and/or other permissible fines, penalties and
charges. The collection fee shall be assessed against all payments made by the
taxpayer whether or not the balance due is paid in full with one payment, or
over time with more than one payment. The assessment of the collection fee
shall be made by the law firm or collection agency after the delinquent account
has been outsourced for collection. Additionally, court costs shall be added to
the balance due as they are incurred but shall not be assessed a collection
fee. (Ord. 2012-12. Passed 5-7-12.)

an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this

location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of

have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an

location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith

      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may

profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.

election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):

average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section

under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.03 of this Ordinance, of 1.00%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes

payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Wellington. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Wellington
as the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this Ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Wellington income tax with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
either the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued
or of such corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other

employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village of Wellington income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Wellington until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Wellington income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an

municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;

wages as provided in Section

            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Wellington only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Wellington than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village of Wellington exceeds the 20-day threshold,
the employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Wellington for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village of
Wellington.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
of Wellington under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold
tax for the Village of Wellington for the first 20 days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Village of Wellington.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village of Wellington and
the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the

year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.

182.041 COLLECTION AT SOURCE: WINNINGS FROM CASINO, SPORTS GAMING FACILITY, OR
VIDEO LOTTERY TERMINAL.
   (A)   Each casino facility or casino operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9)
of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Section 3772.01 of the Revised Code,
respectively, each lottery sales agent conducting video lottery terminals on
behalf of the state (including but not limited to video lottery terminals for
lottery sports gaming, as defined in Section 3770.23 of the Revised Code), and
each type b sports gaming proprietor offering sports gaming at a sports gaming
facility, as those terms are defined in Section 3775.01 of the Revised Code, is
hereby required to report, withhold, and remit municipal income tax to the
income tax clerk, with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages, as
provided in Section 718.031 of the Revised Code and subject to the procedures,
requirements, and penalties stated therein. Amounts deducted and withheld by a
casino operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports gaming proprietor are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
   (B)   A casino operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports gaming
proprietor that fails to file a required return and remit the amounts required
to be deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld
and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
   (C)   If a casino operator or sports gaming proprietor sells the casino
facility or sports gaming facility, or otherwise quits the casino or sports
gaming business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. If a video lottery sales
agent ceases to operate video lottery terminals, the amounts deducted and
withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and
payable. The successor of any such entity shall withhold an amount of the
purchase money that is sufficient to cover the amounts deducted and withheld
along with any penalties and interest thereon until the predecessor casino
operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports gaming proprietor produces
either of the following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (D)   The failure of a casino operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports
gaming proprietor to deduct and withhold the required amount from a person's
winnings does not relieve that person from liability for the municipal income
tax with respect to those winnings.
   (E)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator, or by a video lottery sales
agent, or by a Type B sports gaming proprietor under Section 718.031 of the
Revised Code are deemed to be paid to the municipal corporation for which the
taxes were withheld on the date the taxes are withheld from the taxpayer's
winnings. Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 718.08 of the Revised Code. This division applies only to the person
for whom the amount is deducted and withheld.

taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village of
Wellington's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to

municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village of Wellington income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village of Wellington. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Village of Wellington income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated Village of Wellington income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village of Wellington income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1)
to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village of Wellington
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Wellington. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Wellington. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Wellington;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Wellington income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
Ordinance on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Wellington income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village of Wellington income
tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Wellington in
accordance with this Ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Wellington before January 1, 2016, to
file a consolidated or combined tax return with the Village of Wellington may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter
182 may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid

that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,

dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of

182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.

hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Wellington under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of
Wellington but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the

request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18 (A)(4).

Village of Wellington as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation
on refunds.

withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village of Wellington's tax rate is less than the tax rate in
the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
the Village of Wellington's tax rate. However, if the Village of Wellington's
tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in
excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Wellington,
along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of
nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Wellington. The amended return shall be
filed on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be

facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

any additional Village of Wellington income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.

182.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest
(Ord. 2015-44. Passed 11-2-15.)
182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Wellington
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the Village of
Wellington official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-44. Passed 11-2-15.)
182.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Wellington that arises pursuant to the Village of
Wellington's income tax imposed in accordance with this Ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-44. Passed 11-2-15.)
182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. 
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Wellington as authorized by this Ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Ordinance and other related tax information to the internal revenue service,
the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Wellington from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-44. Passed 11-2-15.)
   (c)    If an employee, prospective employee, or contractor in the service of
the Village of Wellington or a regional council of governments servicing
Wellington has, or will have, access to or the use of federal tax information,
the Tax Administrator shall request that the Superintendent of the Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation conduct a criminal records check
based on the individual's fingerprints in accordance with Section 109.572 of
the Ohio Revised Code. The Tax Administrator shall request that criminal record
information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation be obtained as part of the
Criminal Records Check.
   The individual and the Tax Administrator shall also comply with any separate
request by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a national criminal
records check.
(Ord. 2020-19. Passed 6-1-20.)
182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village of Wellington
ordinance or state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly
procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report,
return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or

of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,

such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and

title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).

as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court
may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and

the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
 
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude
or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may
affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and
require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

545.08 (Unauthorized Use of Property), of the Codified Ordinances;
      (11)   Any weapons, explosives, firearms or handgun violation under
Chapter
549 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (12)   Any violation of Section
1173.012 (accumulation of junk) of the Codified Ordinances; and
      (13)   Any felony offense as defined by the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)    (1)   As used in this Section, "property" means and includes land,
together with appurtenant land, such as a parking area, loading area,
landscaping, buildings and structures, provided, however, that, if a property
consists of, or is subdivided into, more than one occupancy unit, such as
apartments, office suites, storefronts, or condominiums, "property" shall be
limited to that occupancy unit at which a nuisance activity has occurred or is
occurring, unless repetitive nuisance activities are caused by the same actor
(s) at multiple unit locations.
      (2)   Upon finding that three or more nuisance activities declared in
this section have occurred within or in connection with, the same property
within any twelve month period, the Village may cause a written notice and
order to abate nuisance to be served on the owner of the property by the Chief
of Police or his designee, declaring that such property is a nuisance property.
The notice and order shall set forth the nature of the nuisance, the estimated
costs to abate any future nuisance, and state that the owner may avoid being
charged the costs of such abatement by taking steps to prevent any further
nuisance activity as set forth in this section. The notice shall further state
that if a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in this section
occurs within twelve months of the date of the first nuisance activity, the
Village may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities using
administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement
shall be assessed on the nuisance property. Notice shall be served as set forth
in division (g) below.
   (c)   If within twelve months after the first of the three nuisances
referred to in division (b) of this section has occurred, a fourth nuisance
activity as declared in this section occurs, the Village may abate the nuisance
by responding to the activity using administrative and law enforcement actions,
and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property in
the same manner as in division (h) below, and the costs shall be calculated as
set forth in division (e) of this section. The Village shall cause the Chief of
Police or his designee to provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property
of the Village's intent to assess the costs of abatement against the owner's
property at least thirty days before such costs are certified to the County for
assessment against the property, and such notice shall contain a description of
the nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice of intent to assess the
property, and the cost to abate. Notice shall be served as set forth in
division (g) of this section.
   (d)    The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief
of Police or his designee pursuant to this section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
thirty days of the date of the notice. If the Chief of Police finds that the
facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief shall
rescind the notice. Otherwise the Chief shall deny the request and refer the
appeal for hearing before a Board consisting of the Mayor, Village Manager, and
Council President. Any such appeal shall not stay any actions by the Village.
On appeal before that Board, the Village must show by a preponderance of the
evidence that each violation stated in the notice being appealed has occurred,
and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance property or of the
intent of the Village to assess the property for abatement costs, whichever is
applicable, is justified. The Village shall be deemed to have failed to have
met this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence
that:
      (1)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
      (2)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly
and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 5321.17(c)
and 5321.04(a)(9); or
      (3)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C.
5321.17(c) and 5321.04(a)(9).
   (e)    Costs of abatement shall be assessed based upon the hourly wage of
the police officer, officers, or Village employee(s) involved in the abatement
of the nuisance activity, plus 75%, multiplied by the number of hours required
to abate the nuisance.
   (f)    The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the Village on a property, do not affect or limit
the Village's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the village's ordinances.
   (g)    Any notice described in this Section may be served by delivering it
personally to the owner or leaving it at the owner's usual place of business or
residence, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved,
or by mailing it to the owner, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of
general circulation within the Village if it cannot be served in any of the
other ways above mentioned.
   (h)    If the nuisance is not abated within the required time, the Police
Chief may cause its abatement and report the cost thereof to Finance Director,
who will cause the same to be assessed on the real estate on which the nuisance
existed or the cause or source thereof was located.
(Ord. 2021-20. Passed 7-19-21.)
   (i)   No enforcement action or abatement under this section will be ordered
against a real property owner who is either: (1) an individual who was a
complainant or a victim in whole or in part of the incidents that formed the
basis of the nuisance enforcement action; or (2) an individual who has a known
disability or has a relationship or association with an individual who has a
known disability pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, as is set
forth in 28 C.F.R. Ch. 1, Pt. 35, as may be hereinafter amended ("ADA"), in
whole or in part of the incidents that formed the basis of the nuisance
enforcement action. No abatement measure against an individual will be
predicated upon the fact that such individual called for police or emergency
services. Any decision or related order in a nuisance proceeding imposing
enforcement or abatement action shall make a finding whether that individual is
a victim, complainant, or qualifies for an exemption pursuant to the ADA. If
the individual is not found to be a victim or complainant, and also does not
qualify for an exemption pursuant to the ADA, then that individual may be the
subject of such enforcement or abatement action under this section.
(Ord. 2022-41. Passed 9-19-22.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of                      Maximum
Misdemeanor                  Fine
First degree                 $ 5000.00
Second degree             4000.00
Third degree                 3000.00
Fourth degree             2000.00
Minor                        1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically 2000.00
classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

505.01 DOGS AND OTHER ANIMALS RUNNING AT LARGE; DANGEROUS DOGS AND VICIOUS
DOGS.
   (a)   Definitions. As used in this section, the following words and phrases
shall have the meanings indicated:
      (1)   "Dangerous dog" means a dog that, without provocation, has chased
or approached in either a menacing fashion or an apparent attitude of attack,
or has attempted to bite or otherwise endanger any person, while that dog is
off the premises of its owner, keeper, or harborer and not under the reasonable
control of its owner, keeper, harborer, or some other responsible person, or
not physically restrained or confined in a locked pen which has a top, locked
fenced yard, or other locked enclosure which has a top. "Dangerous dog" does
not include a "police dog" that has chased or approached in either a menacing
fashion or an apparent attitude of attack, or has attempted to bite or
otherwise endanger any person while the "police dog" is being used to assist
one or more law enforcement officers in the performance of their official
duties.
      (2)   "Menacing fashion" means that a dog would cause any person being
chased or approached to reasonably believe that the dog will cause physical
injury to that person.
      (3)   "Police dog" means a dog that has been trained, and may be used, to
assist one or more law enforcement officers in the performance of their
official duties.
      (4)   "Vicious dog" means a dog that, without provocation, meets any of
the following:
         A.   Has killed or caused serious injury to any person; or
         B.   Has caused an injury to a person, or has killed or seriously
injured a companion animal.
   "Vicious dog" does not include either of the following:
         A.   A "police dog" that has killed or caused serious injury to any
person or that has caused injury, other than killing or serious injury, to any
person while the "police dog" is being used to assist one or more law
enforcement officers in the performance of their official duties; or
         B.   A dog that has killed or caused serious injury to any person
while a person was committing or attempting to commit a trespass or other
criminal offense on the property of the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog.
      (5)   "Without provocation" means that a dog was not teased, tormented,
or abused by a person, or that the dog was not coming to the aid or the defense
of a person who was not engaged in illegal or criminal activity and who was not
using the dog as a means of carrying out such activity.
   (b)   No person being the owner or having charge of cattle, horses, swine,
sheep, geese, ducks, goats, turkeys, chickens or other fowl or animals shall
permit them to run at large upon any public place, or upon any unenclosed lands
or upon the premises of another. Whoever violates this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (c)   No owner, keeper or harborer of any female dog shall permit it to go
beyond the premises of the owner, keeper or harborer at any time the dog is in
heat unless the dog is properly in leash. Whoever violates this subsection is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a first offense and a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree for each subsequent offense.
   (d)   Except when a dog is lawfully engaged in hunting and accompanied by
the owner, keeper, harborer or handler of the dog, no owner, keeper or harborer
of any dog shall fail at any time to do either of the following:
      (1)   Keep the dog physically confined or restrained upon the premises of
the owner, keeper or harborer by a leash, tether, adequate fence, supervision
or secure enclosure to prevent escape;
      (2)   Keep the dog on a leash and under the reasonable control of some
person;
   The running at large of a dog off the premises of the owner is prima facie
evidence that it is unconfined in violation of this subsection.
   Whoever violates this subsection is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a
first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for each subsequent
offense.
   (e)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in subsection (c) or (d),
above, if the offender is guilty of a violation of subsection (b) or (c)
hereof, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the dog that
he owns, keeps or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both.
   (f)   No owner, keeper or harborer of a "dangerous dog" or "vicious dog"
shall fail to do either of the following:
      (1)   While that dog is on the premises of the owner, keeper or harborer,
securely confine it at all times in a locked pen that has a top, locked fenced
yard, or other locked enclosure that has a top, except that a "dangerous dog"
may, in the alternative, be tied with a leash or tether so that the dog is
adequately restrained;
      (2)   While that dog is off the premises of the owner, keeper or
harborer, keep that dog on a chain-link leash or tether that is not more than
six feet in length and additionally do at least one of the following:
         A.   Keep that dog in a locked pen that has a top, locked fenced yard
or other locked enclosure that has a top;
         B.   Have the leash or tether controlled by a person who is of
suitable age and discretion or securely attach, tie or affix the leash or
tether to the ground or a stationary object or fixture so that the dog is
adequately restrained and station such a person in close enough proximity to
that dog so as to prevent it from causing injury to any person; or
         C.   Muzzle that dog.
   Whoever violates this subsection is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a
first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for each subsequent
offense; provided, however, that if a person being an owner, harborer, or
keeper of any animal is found to be in violation of this subsection and the
animal inflicts serious physical harm to any person, the violator shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. For purposes of this subsection,
"serious physical harm" means any of the following:
      (1)   Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally
require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;
      (2)   Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;
      (3)   Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether
partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity;
      (4)   Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or
that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;
      (5)   Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to
result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or
intractable pain. (Ord. 2017-44. Passed 12-4-17.)
505.02 IMPOUNDING AND DISPOSITION; RECORDS.
   (a)   A police officer or animal warden may impound every animal or dog
found in violation of Section

otherwise reasonably determined, notice shall be posted in the pound or animal
shelter both describing the dog and place where seized and advising the unknown
owner that unless the dog is redeemed within three days, it may thereafter be
sold or destroyed according to law. If the dog is wearing a valid registration
tag or the identity of the owner, keeper or harborer is otherwise reasonably
determined, notice shall be given by certified mail to such owner, keeper or
harborer that the dog has been impounded and unless redeemed within fourteen
days of the date of notice, it may thereafter be sold or destroyed according to
law. Any dog seized and impounded may be redeemed by its owner, keeper or
harborer at any time prior to the applicable redemption period upon payment of
all lawful costs assessed against the animal and upon providing the dog with a
valid registration tag if it has none.
 
   (b)   A record of all dogs impounded, the disposition of the same, the
owner's name and address where known, and a statement of any costs assessed
against the dog shall be kept by any poundkeeper.

   (a)   Except for guide dogs registered under Ohio R.C. 955.011 and dogs kept

R.C. 955.16, no person shall own, keep or harbor a dog more than three months
of age without annually registering such dog with the County Auditor. Failure
of any dog at any time to wear a valid registration tag shall be prima-facie
evidence of lack of registration and subject such dog to impounding and
disposition as provided by Ohio R.C. 955.16.
 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a
first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for each subsequent
offense.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
 
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08, 
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
 545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

proposals containing the following elements.

777.01 INTENT.
   The purpose of this chapter is to permit and encourage sidewalk use that is
compatible with other public uses of the public sidewalk and rights-of-way. The
Village recognizes and supports the vitality and activity that may be generated
by the operation of mobile food vendors within the Village, but also recognizes
that careful consideration must be exercised both to prevent the obstruction of
pedestrian, bicycle, and motor vehicle traffic, and to assure that reasonable
levels of safe and sanitary operations are carried out. The issuance of a
permit pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute nor shall it be construed
to constitute a vacation or abandonment by the Village of its interest in the
right-of-way or any easements contained therein.
(Ord. 2018-32. Passed 9-17-18.)
777.02 DEFINITIONS.

operates a mobile food establishment that is incorporated in or propelled by a
vehicle. A mobile food vendor does not include "meals on wheels," ice cream
trucks or the home delivery of food.
      (Ord. 2018-32. Passed 9-17-18.)
777.03 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, organization, or business entity shall operate within the Village
as a mobile food vendor without first having been issued a permit from the
Manager authorizing such operation. An organization which qualifies as a tax-
exempt charitable institution pursuant to subsection 501(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, which organization intends to directly operate a mobile food
establishment through its own volunteers or employees only shall not be
required to obtain a mobile food vendor permit, or to otherwise comply with the
provisions of this chapter pertaining to mobile food vendors. (Ord. 2018-32.
Passed 9-17-18.)
777.04 APPLICATION AND PERMIT FEES.
   (a)   An applicant to operate as a mobile food vendor may apply for a
single-event permit, for an event not to exceed three (3) consecutive days, for
a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per event, or a permit for more than a single
event, which will expire at the end of each calendar year, for a fee of one
hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (b)   Permit application fees are non-refundable once submitted, regardless
of whether a permit is issued or denied. (Ord. 2018-32. Passed 9-17-18.)
   
777.05  PERMIT APPLICATION.
   The application to operate as a mobile food vendor shall be made to the
Manager on a form provided. The request for permit shall contain:
   (a)   A completed application, showing the name, address and telephone
number of the person/entity who will own and/or operate a mobile food
establishment;
   (b)   A description of the food cart, food truck or other vending device
from which the applicant intends to vend, including the dimensions of the cart,
truck or device;

establishment, including a plan illustrating the proposed location(s) of the
operation of the mobile food establishment, proposed operating hours, and
identifying the location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, streets
and driveway approaches, open spaces, refuse and service areas, utilities,
signs, landscaping in the vicinity;
   (d)   A photograph of any mobile food vendor vehicle/unit to be used in

      (Ord. 2018-32. Passed 9-17-18.)
777.06 LOCATION RULES AND REVIEW CRITERIA FOR MOBILE FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS.
   The Manager shall review the application for its compliance with the
following criteria:
   (a)   (1)   The preferred location for a mobile food establishment is on
privately-owned, non-residential property. The applicant will identify such
location, its owner, and will provide written consent of the owner to the
application. The use of any such location must be consistent with the
applicable zoning for the property. The Manager will not approve an application
where operation of the mobile food vendor will significantly obstruct a public
way, impair the movement of pedestrians or vehicles, impair the clear view of
traffic, or pose any other hazard to public safety.
      (2)   An applicant may request permission to:
         A.   Temporarily operate a food cart which is not independently
capable of movement on a public sidewalk within the Downtown Business District.
Any proposed location where the presence of a food cart on the sidewalk must be
compatible with the public interest in use of sidewalk areas as public right-
of- way; and the Manager may consider the width of the sidewalk; the proximity
and location of existing street installations, including but not limited to
signposts, lamp posts, parking meters, bus shelters, benches, bike racks, and
newspaper vending devices; the presence of bus stops, truck loading zones, and
fire exits or fire escapes; pedestrian and vehicular traffic patterns; and
other factors he or she deems relevant. No permitted location shall be within
ten (10) feet of another permitted location. No permitted location shall be
designated where the clear, continuous, unobstructed sidewalk for the
passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less than six (6) feet.
         B.   Temporarily locate the mobile food establishment within right-of-
way areas within the Downtown Business District where vehicles may otherwise
lawfully park. However, all street parking by the vendor shall remain subject
to all applicable restrictions within the Codified Ordinances of Wellington,
including but not limited to the following:
351.03 (prohibited standing or parking places.);
351.04 (parking near curb; handicapped locations on public and private lots and

of Police, the Manager shall determine whether a proposed location is
compatible with the public interest in using the right-of-way, considering such
factors as the width of the right-of-way, available parking, traffic, pavement
durability, and the times of operation; and will not approve an application
where the operation of the mobile food vendor will significantly obstruct a
public way, impair the movement of pedestrians or vehicles, impair the clear
view of traffic, or pose any other hazard to public safety. Any such approval
for a location within the right-of-way shall be subject to change or revocation
when necessitated by public safety requirements.
   (b)   No mobile food vendor shall provide any dining area, tables, chairs,
booths, bar stools, benches, or standup counters, unless a proposal for such
seating/standup arrangements has submitted with the permit application and
approved by the Manager.
(Ord. 2018-32. Passed 9-17-18.)
777.07 CONDITIONS OF PERMIT.
   All mobile food establishment permit holders shall be subject to the
following:

transferable in any manner.
   (c)   The permit may be temporarily suspended by the Manager if the right-
of-way is being used and the public interest requires use of the right-of-way
for a public event, construction, repair, or any other public purpose. In the
event of such a suspension, the Manager shall have the discretion to grant a
proportional extension of the permit time or a proportional refund of the
permit fee, as appropriate.
   (d)   The permit is specifically limited to the area approved (or as

911.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, other than the Village Manager, the Engineer, or the authorized

sidewalk or public way of the Municipality unless a permit to make such opening

(Ord. 2012-13. Passed 5-7-12.)
911.02 APPLICATION; DEPOSIT AND FEE.

single project. Application shall be made to the Director of Finance on a form
prescribed by Council, giving the exact location of the proposed opening, the
kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated and such other facts as may
be provided for. The permit shall be issued only after a cash deposit or bond
of one hundred dollars ($100.00) has been posted with the Municipality,
conditioned upon prompt and satisfactory refilling of excavations and
restoration of all surfaces disturbed. A fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be
charged to cover the costs of supervision and inspection of any excavation,

for draining the floors and repair pits in such manner that no drainage
therefrom shall flow over any street, alley or paved approach. Garage drains
shall be so arranged as to intercept all oil, gasoline or other inflammable
fluids, as well as sand, silt and other solids for the purpose of excluding
them from the sewerage system. Such drains shall have the accumulated oils and
other inflammable fluids pumped or otherwise removed therefrom at regular
intervals, and shall be maintained so as to insure the exclusion of the same
from the sewerage system.
      Garage drains shall be kept free of sand, silt and other solids and shall
be subject to a periodical inspection. They shall be so constructed as to have
a sand receptor of not less than twelve inches in depth and diameter below the
bottom of the outlet, a seal depth and diameter of not less than twelve inches
in the drain with an outlet therefrom of not less than four inches; a
ventilating chamber of not less than twelve inches in depth and diameter with a
sealed inlet opening not less than four inches in diameter; and a ventilating
pipe leading from the ventilating chamber of not less than three inches in
diameter, and carried up above the highest part of the roof and subject to the
same conditions as for roof outlets of soil and waste pipes.
      Capacity for the sand receptor is based on a storage capacity of four
automobiles and a proportionate cubical capacity must be added for each
additional automobile storage capacity with corresponding diameter of the drain
carried to the floor line.
      Every existing building or one hereafter constructed or converted into a
place of business where oil, gasoline, benzine, naptha or other inflammable
oils or compounds used, shall be provided with a special drain the same as that
specified herein.
   (c)   Detrimental Wastes. Waste shall not be discharged into a storm water
sewer but may be discharged into a sanitary sewer if such waste is of such
character so as not to be detrimental to the sewerage system, or to the sewage
treatment works to be determined by the Plumbing Inspector.
   (d)   Surface Water. Surface water, rain water from roofs, subsoil drainage,
building foundation drainage, cistern overflow, clean water from condensors,
waste water from water motors and elevators, and any other clean and
unobjectionable waste water must be discharged into a storm or combined sewer
when available and in no case into a sanitary sewer.
   (e)   Kitchen Wastes. Kitchen or other greasy wastes from hotels,
restaurants, club houses, public institutions or other establishments in which
much cooking is done or greasy wastes collected, shall be intercepted by a
catch basin or a grease trap, and then conducted to the house sewer.

   (a)   Tests. All piping of a drainage or roughed in plumbing sanitary system
shall be given two tests by the plumber in charge. The material and labor for
the tests shall be furnished by the plumber and tests made in the presence of
the Plumbing Inspector. The tests shall be made in the following order: first,
the house drains; second, the soil and waste vents and all vertical piping on
the whole system. The first and second tests may be combined but the second
shall not be made until after the first. Soil, waste and vent and all work
known as "rough" work inside conductor pipe stacks and between the house drain
connections to points above the finished and beyond the finished face of walls
and partitions, shall be tested when the whole stack is completed and topped
out above the roof, with water. The water test shall be applied by closing the
opening at the outlet end of the house drain and all openings in the piping
with proper testing plugs to the highest opening above the roof, and completely
filling the system with water. The water columns shall be left standing at
least fifteen minutes. If the water level remains constant such time, the
system shall be acceptably tested. The house drainage shall be acceptably
tested when subjected to a ten foot water head for fifteen minute constant
level. All alterations, repairs or extensions which include more than ten feet
shall be inspected and tested.

building(s) situated within the Village is required at his expense to
disconnect all existing roof drains from sanitary and combined sewers in
accordance with the provisions of this section within 180 days after the date
of official notice to do so. Discharge units connecting to a Village Sanitary
Sewer or Combination Sewer shall be free of all storm water.
   It is prohibited that any new construction of discharge units shall have any
storm water connections of roof drains, footer and foundation tiles or any
other connection to a sanitary sewer. The Village retains the right to prohibit
new taps to the system if said tap would cause the capacity of the system to be
exceeded.
(Res. 1991-1. Passed 7-16-91.)
 
922.03 PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a
private sewage disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public
sewer in compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools, and
similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with
suitable material.
(Res. 1991-1. Passed 7-16-91.)
922.04 BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or
opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the Utilities Director.
   (b)   There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits:
      (1)    For residential and commercial service, and
      (2)    For service to establishments producing industrial wastes.
   In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special
form furnished by the Village. The permit application shall be supplemented by
any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the
judgment of the Utilities Director. All permit and inspection fees for a
building sewer permit shall be paid to the Village Treasurer at the time the
application is filed.
   (c)   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall by borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
Village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned
by the installation of the building sewer.
   (d)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway; in this
case, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear
building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
   (e)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Utilities Director, to meet
all requirements of this resolution.
   (f)   The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ANSI specifications
(A21.6) or equal; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specification (C-700) or
equal; PVC sewer pipe, ASTM specification (D3034 or 3033) or equal; or other
suitable material approved by the Utilities Director. Joints shall be tight and
waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten (10) feet
of a water service pipe or fifty (50) feet of a well shall be constructed of
cast iron soil pipe with leaded joints or PVC waterline equivalent. Cast iron
pipe with leaded joints may be required by the Utilities Director where the
building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or
unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except
that non-metallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed
or cradle as approved by the Utilities Director.
   (g)   The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Utilities Director.
   (h)    The building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation
four (4) feet above the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three (3) feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby
be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar
as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe
and fittings. All building sewers shall be a maximum of four and one-half (4½)
feet below finished floor elevation. Any wastes discharged below this
elevation, including water closets, showers, floor drains and washers shall be
pumped to this elevation. Bilevel construction shall be three and one-half (3½)
feet below average finished grade of lot.
   (i)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer
with appropriate check valve so that all discharges are less than three and
one-half (3½) feet below grade.
   (j)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Utilities Director.
Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM
specification except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been
inspected.
   (k)   All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
   (l)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If
the public sewer is twelve (12) inches in diameter or less, and no properly
located "Y" branch is available, the owner shall at his expense install a "Y"
branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the Utilities Director.
When the public sewer is greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter, and no
properly located "Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the
public sewer to receive the building sewer with entry in the downstream
direction at an angle of about forty-five (45) degrees. A forty-five (45)
degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as
not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the
building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher
elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be
made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete.
Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the
Utilities Director.
   (m)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Utilities
Director when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Utilities Director or his/her representative.
   (n)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory in the Village.
(Res. 1991-1. Passed 7-16-91.)
 
   (o)    Building Sewer Maintenance and Repairs.
      (1)    Building sewers shall be routinely maintained by, and at the
expense of, the owner(s) of the property being served by such building sewers,
from the point of intersection with the main village sewer line to the
structure being served by such lateral. Routine maintenance by a property owner
shall include the removal of any tree roots, foreign objects, accumulated
grease or other obstructions.
      (2)    In cases where there is determined to be "damage" to that portion
of a building sewer that lies within roadway property, the village may, at the
discretion of the village manager, assume all or part of the costs of roadway
property building sewer repair work if the village manager determines that the
damage is not the result of (a) the property owner's failure to maintain the
building sewer, (b) is not the result of abusive or over-aggressive attempts by
the property owner, or someone engaged by the property owner, to remove
blockages, and (c) is not the result of an illegal cross-connection within the
property owner's real property. In such cases, the burden shall be on the
property owner to establish that he satisfies the foregoing standards. The
property owner may provide an in-line video recording of the building line to
demonstrate that it has been properly maintained.
      (3)    A property owner shall be responsbible for repairing all damage to
any building sewer that lies outside roadway property, at the owner's expense.
      (4)    Nothing in this section shall be construed or enlarged upon as
evidence that the village is in any manner liable for damage to private
property, the structures thereon, or the contents thereof, resulting from a
back-up of water, sewage, or materials attributable, in whole or in part, to
damage to or blockage of any portion of building sewer.

923.05 STORM WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY.
   (a)    It is hereby declared to be in the best interest of the Village to
form a structure and procedures designed to better manage storm water and
provide for storm drainage improvements thus reducing combined sewer overflows,
recognizing that all real property within the Village will benefit from the
installation of an adequate storm drainage system, and that the cost of such a
system should therefore be assessed against such property.
   (b)    There is hereby established in the Village a storm water drainage
utility, the Village hereby declaring its intention to acquire, own, construct,
equip, operate and maintain open drainage ways, underground storm drains,
equipment and appurtenances necessary, useful or convenient for a complete
storm water drainage system, including the maintenance, extension and
improvement of the present storm drainage system.
   (c)    The Village Manager shall manage, conduct and control the storm water
drainage utility, and is authorized to develop and adopt plans, policies and
regulations necessary or desirable for the regulation and operation of said
utility.
   (d)    There is hereby levied and imposed upon all premises which have been
improved within the Village just and equitable charges for storm drainage
service or subsequent service, maintenance, operation and extension, and to
establish a Storm Drainage Fund for the foregoing purposes.
   (e)    The charges shall be collected with the monthly water bill of water
users, billed with sanitary sewer for those connected to sewer alone, or billed
alone as a storm drainage charge for those users not connected to and/or not
charged for Village water and/or sanitary sewer.
   (f)    The charges shall be paid monthly by those liable therefor, and
placed in a Storm Drainage Fund to be used only for the purposes stated herein.
   (g)    It is hereby determined that property is furnished service in
proportion to the amount of the property's impervious surface. The basic unit
of service is 2,900 s.f. of impervious surface applicable to all conventionally
developed residential properties. All other properties shall be furnished
service equivalent to multiples of basic service units of 2,900 s.f. of
impervious surface as calculated for individual properties by the Village
Manager .
   (h)    Rates shall be set by action of Council. In no year shall the
operating fund of the utility show a loss.
   (i)    The rate for residential properties, which is based on a unit of
service of 2,900 s.f. shall be $6.00 per month. All other properties shall be
billed at multiples of basic service units of 2,900 s.f. per month.
   (j)    The established rates may be reduced for a property, other than a
conventionally developed one or two family property, where approved runoff
control measures have been implemented. Review and analysis of these measures
shall be handled on an individual case basis by the Village  Manager . The
maximum rate of reduction shall be 50% of the established rate. Any person
aggrieved by a decision of the Village  Manager  under this section may appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County, Ohio pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506.
   (k)    The owner of any property subject to a charge provided herein shall
pay the same, when due, to the Village of Wellington. If any charges due
hereunder are not paid when due, the Law Director shall collect them by actions
at law in the name of the Village.
(Ord. 2017-39. Passed 2-4-17.)
923.99 PENALTY.

   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of these rules and regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water system.
 
   (b)   Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water system of the Municipality of Wellington in
Lorain County, Ohio.
 
   (c)   Policy. The Superintendent of Water shall be responsible for
protection of the public potable water system from contamination due to

      (Ord. 2008-46. Passed 12-1-08.)
929.05 RED FLAG IDENTIFICATION.
   (a)   Covered Accounts. A covered account includes any account that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions. Every new and
existing customer account that meets the following criteria is covered by this
program:
      (1)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft; or
      (2)   Business, personal and household accounts for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the safety or soundness of the Village from
identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or
litigation risks.
   (b)   Red Flags. The following red flags are potential indicators of fraud.
Any time a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent,
it should be investigated for verification.
      (1)   Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting agency;
      (2)   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report;
      (3)   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report; or
      (4)   A notice of address discrepancy from a consumer reporting agency as
defined in §334.82(b) of the Fairness and Accuracy in Credit Transactions Act.
      (5)   Red flags also include consumer reports that indicate a pattern of
activity inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an
applicant or customer, such as:
         A.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
         B.   An unusual number of recently established credit relationships;
         C.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with respect
to recently established credit relationships; or
         D.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of
account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (c)   Suspicious Documents. The following may also be potential indicators
of fraud:
      (1)   Documents provided for identification that appear to have been
altered or forged;
      (2)   The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification;
      (3)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification;
      (4)   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the Village, such as a
signature card or a recent check; or
      (5)   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (d)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information. The following may also be
potential indicators of fraud:
      (1)   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Village. For example:
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
         B.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File; or
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
      (3)   Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
Village. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application
      (4)   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Village. For example:
         A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a
prison; or
         B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         C.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
         D.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large
number of other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (5)   The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (6)   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Village.
      (7)   When using security questions (mother's maiden name, pet's name,
etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from
a wallet or consumer report.
   (e)   Unusual Use of, or Suspicious Activity Related to, the Covered
Account. The following may also be potential indicators of fraud:
      (1)   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the Village receives a request for new, additional, or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
      (2)   A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)   A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; A material
change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the

CHAPTER 931
Charges for Services in the General Fund
931.01   Assessment of charges.
931.02   Procedure for implementing charges.
931.03   Restriction on charges.
931.04   Village access to utility services.
931.01 ASSESSMENT OF CHARGES
   (a)   There is hereby established as "Charges for Services in the General
Fund" ("GSGF") an annual administrative charge based upon a percentage of the
gross revenues collected by the Village's municipal electric, water, sanitary
sewer, storm sewer, and garbage collection departments/operations/ services,
which charges are determined by the Council to be a fair allocation of the
costs to the Village of providing legislative, legal, general administrative,
and public safety services to each of said departments. These charges shall be
made against the Water Fund, the Sewer Fund, the Electric Fund, the Garbage
Fund, and the Storm Sewer Capital Fund and shall be credited to the General
Fund.
   (b)   The Base Standard Rate for the GSGF shall be 5.50% of gross revenues,
subject to modification as otherwise set forth in this Chapter. If, for any
period, the base rate has not otherwise been revised as set forth in this
Chapter, the rate shall default to the Base Standard Rate.
(Ord. 2016-54. Passed 1-3-17.)
931.02 PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTING CHARGES.
   (a)   Beginning on or about December 1 of each year, the Director of Finance
shall determine the gross revenue which has actually been collected during the
previous 12 months in each of the 5 Funds described in Section
931.01, shall calculate the GSGF, using the Base Standard Rate multiplied by
the revenues in each individual fund from the prior twelve months, shall divide
each of those charges by 4, and shall report to Council the Anticipated
Quarterly GSGF charge for each Fund. The Council will, thereafter, retain the
option to, by Motion, waive or reduce any or all of those charges against any
one or more of the Village's departments as Council determines appropriate.
Thereafter, in the subsequent January, the Director of Finance shall make the
GSGF charge, based on either the Base Standard Rate, or the modifications
thereof as directed by the Council.
   
   (b)   The Director of Finance shall proceed in the same fashion in each
March, June, and September thereafter; the Council shall retain the same option
to modify the anticipated GSGF charge for each successive quarter, and the
Director of Finance shall then, in each subsequent quarter, make GSGF charges
in subsequent quarters, based on either the Base Standard Rate, or the
modifications thereof as directed by the Council.
   (c)   Regardless of the foregoing process, the Director of Finance shall
report to Council at any time it appears that proceeding with implementation of
the GSGF charge will jeopardize the fiscal integrity of, or be contrary to
prudent financial planning, with respect to any one or more of the affected
Funds; and the Council retains the authority to, by Motion, waive or reduce any
or all of those charges against any one or more of the Village's departments as
Council determines appropriate. (Ord. 2016-54. Passed 1-3-17.)
931.03 RESTRICTION ON CHARGES.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall authorize the Director of Finance to proceed
with implementing any GSGF charge against any Fund in the event that, or to the
extent that, such a charge would cause the Village to be in breach of contract
or to violate the terms of any bond covenant, or to violate any state or
federal law.
(Ord. 2016-54. Passed 1-3-17.)
931.04 VILLAGE ACCESS TO UTILITY SERVICES.
   The interdepartmental use of utilities by all Village departments will be
without charge to the receiving department.
(Ord. 2016-54. Passed 1-3-17.)

warrant a change in the account holder's name; and
      (4)   Picture identification of the applicant.
   (d)   A security deposit in the amount of $250.00 to cover each new account
(a single deposit to cover electric and/or water account(s)), to be held by the
Village, without interest, until termination of service. Such deposit may be
applied by the Village to any final water or electric bill; and any remaining
balance shall be returned to the depositor, without interest thereon.
      (Ord. 2015-42. Passed 11-2-15.)
933.02 PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS.
   (a)   Payments of utility accounts are due on or before the 15th of each
month. If the 15th falls on a weekend or holiday, the due date is moved to the
following business days.
   (b)   For purposes of this Chapter, a payment will be deemed "on time" under
any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Drop box payments received by 8:00 a.m. on the 16th of the month;
      (2)   Online payments made at any time on the 15th of the month;
      (3)   Payments postmarked on or before the 15th of the month;
      (4)   Utility Counter payments made in person or by phone prior to 8:00
a.m. on the 16th of the month.
   (c)   For purposes of this Chapter, a payment will be deemed "late," and
subject to a 10% late charge, under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   Drop box payments received after 8:00 a.m. on the 16th of the
month;
      (2)   Online payments made at any time after the 15th of the month;
      (3)   Payments postmarked after the 15th of the month;
      (4)   Utility Counter payments made in person or by phone after 8:00 a.m.
on the 16th of the month
      (5)   Payments received after the 15th of the month but bearing no
postmark.
   For extraordinary good cause, the Finance Director or Village Manager shall
have the discretion to waive a late fee charge once.
   (d)   With respect to all accounts subject to a repayment plan on the
effective date of this Ordinance, all arrearages must be paid in full no later
than March 31, 2016; accounts not paid in full by that date will thereafter be
subject to the collection/disconnection procedure specified in Section
933.03.
(Ord. 2015-42. Passed 11-2-15.)
933.03 COLLECTION AND DISCONNECTION OF ACCOUNTS.
   The collection process for Utility Accounts shall normally be conducted as
follows:
   (a)   Notice of a Deficiency in the Account (the "Deficiency Letter") shall
normally be issued on or about the 24th of each month to accounts with an
unpaid balance of $200 or more;
   (b)   The Deficiency Letter shall specify that the Final Due Date for
payment is the first Monday of the following calendar month (provided that this
shall be deferred to Tuesday if Monday is a Village holiday);
   (c)   The Deficiency Letter shall specify that utility service will be
disconnected on a specific date (the "Disconnect Date"), which will be the
Wednesday (Thursday, if a holiday delays the Final Due Date) following the
Final Due Date;
   (d)   The Deficiency Letter shall state a date and time prior to the
Disconnect Date for a pretermination hearing before the Village Manager (or his
designee) at which time the account holder may appear and dispute the
deficiency asserted by the Village. The sole issue at the time of this hearing
shall be afford the account holder to demonstrate that the account is not in
arrears, and shall not be to provide additional time or delay in making payment
in full of the account. Unless the account holder demonstrates to the Village
Manager that the account is not in arrears, the disconnect process shall
continue.
   (e)   An account holder may avoid disconnection of service by taking one of
the following actions, in person, by 8:00 a.m. on the day before the Disconnect
Date:
      (1)   Pay the entire outstanding account balance in full by credit card,
cash, or certified check; or
      (2)   Provide medical certification from a licensed health care provider,
certifying that a resident of the premises has a specific health condition
which would be placed at risk by proceeding with the disconnection. Such
certification shall be deemed valid for a period of thirty (30) days only; and
no more than three such certifications shall be honored in a 12-month period.
   (f)   An account holder may avoid disconnection of service by taking the
following action, in person or by telephone, by 8:00 a.m. on the Disconnect
Date: payment in full of the entire outstanding balance on the account by
credit card, cash, or certified check. (An online payment is not adequate to
avoid disconnection unless the account holder has also contacted the Village in
person or by telephone.)
   (g)   Disconnection shall proceed as scheduled on the Disconnect Date unless
cancelled as a result of the procedures in sections (d), (e), or (f) above; and
a disconnect service charge of $75.00 shall be assessed against the account.
Personnel physically performing the disconnect shall not accept funds from the
account holder. The Finance Director shall attempt to notify the property's
owner when she has notice that the account holder is a tenant.
   (h)   If, at 8:00 a.m. on the Disconnect Date (or the continued Disconnect
Date), the National Weather Service predicts for the Wellington area that a
temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit or lower will occur at any time during the
next 24 hours, the Disconnect Date shall be continued to the next business day.
   (i)   Service will not be reconnected for an account unless and until
payment in full by credit card, cash, or certified check has been made for: the
outstanding balance, any interest or penalties on that balance, the disconnect
charge, a reconnect charge of $75.00, and the security deposit on file is fully
funded.
      (Ord. 2015-42. Passed 11-2-15.)
933.04 BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
   In the event there has been an error pertaining to utility billing for
electricity, water, and/or sewer service, billing adjustments shall be made as
follows:
   (a)    If a customer has been overcharged for service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, overcharges will be
refunded to the customer for the entire period of inaccurate billing, if that
period is discernible by the municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing
is not discernable, overcharges will be calculated based on a time period that
is the shortest of:
      (1)   The time elapsed since the customer's service began,
      (2)   The date of installation of the faulty meter or the date of
implementation of the error resulting in the overcharge (if applicable), or
      (3)   365 days.
   (b)   If a customer has been undercharged for service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, undercharges will be
billed to the customer, and the customer shall pay the charges for the entire
period of inaccurate billing, if that period is discernible by the
municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing is not discernable,
undercharges will be calculated based on a time period that is the shortest of:
      (1)   The time elapsed since the customer's service began,
      (2)   The date of installation of the faulty meter or the date of
implementation of the error resulting in the undercharge (if applicable), or
      (3)   365 days.
Undercharges billed to residential customers shall in no event exceed a period
of 365 days.
Customers shall have the option to pay the amount undercharged in equal
payments spread over the same number of months as the charges were accumulated.
   (c)   This section does not serve as a limitation to billing for
undercharges which are the result of tampering with utility equipment or theft
of utility service, or where a physical act of a customer or its agent causes
inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or inaccurate or no
measurement of the electricity, water, or sewage, as applicable, rendered.

Through the performance of its duties, the Board may not act as a legislative

conditions, alter the basic intent of the Zoning Ordinance to be generally and
equally applicable to all persons covered by a zoning district.
1121.04 JURISDICTION AND POWERS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall operate so as to carry into effect the

in accordance with the intent and purpose of each district.
   (d)   To hear and decide whether or not a non-conforming use should be
granted extensions, additions, or reconstruction (in case of a fifty percent

1121.05 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance.
1121.06 APPEALS; FEES; STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   (a)   Appeals. Appeals to the Zoning Board of Appeals concerning
interpretation or administration of this Zoning Ordinance may be taken by any
person aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of the legislative authority of
the Municipality affected by any decision of the Responsible Authority. Such
appeal shall be taken within twenty (20) days after the decision by filing with
the Responsible Authority and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds upon which the appeal is being taken. The Responsible Authority shall
transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
 
   (b)   Fees. See Section
1117.011 .
 
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Responsible Authority from whom the appeal
is taken certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal is filed with him or
her, that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his or
her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, with a written
notice to the Responsible Authority from whom the appeal is taken.
1121.07 APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals unless and until a written application for a
variance is submitted to the Responsible Authority and the Board, containing:
   (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicants.
   (b)   Legal description of property.
   (c)   Description of nature of variance requested.
   (d)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
      (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this Ordinance.
      (3)   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance, to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
1121.08 REQUIREMENTS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variances may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals where the
strict application of any provision of this Zoning Ordinance would result in
peculiar and exceptional difficulties or undue hardship to the property owner.
A request for a variance may be made to the Board through the Zoning
Administrator by an aggrieved property owner.
 
   (b)   A variance from the provisions or requirements of this Code shall not
be authorized by the Board unless it finds that all the following facts and
conditions exist:
      (1)   That unnecessary hardships would result from the literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Alleged hardships, such
as theoretical loss or limited possibilities of economic advantage, shall not
be considered real hardships. A hardship based on conditions created by the
owner shall not be considered a sufficient hardship for the granting of a
variance. It must be demonstrated that peculiar and special hardships exist
which apply only to the property in question and are separate and distinct from
the general conditions pertaining throughout the district.
      (2)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions applying
to the property in question such as irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of
lot size or shape, exceptional topographical or other physical conditions.
      (3)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and that authorization of a variance is
therefore, necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (4)   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and in the same vicinity and that the granting of such variance will
not be injurious to persons working or residing in the neighborhood.
      (5)   That the granting of such variance will not be contrary to the
public interest (health, safety) or the intent and purpose of this Code and
other adopted plans.
      (6)   That such variance will not permit the establishment within a
district of any use other than those permitted by right within that district,
or any use for which a conditional permit is required.
      (7)   That such variance may not be construed to mean a change of use but
shall mean only a variation or modification from the strict provisions of this
Code.
      (8)   That such variance, if granted, is the minimum modification that
will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.
      (9)   That in no instance shall a variance be considered for the
following reasons:
         A.   Presence of non-conformities in the zoning district.
         B.   Previous variances granted in the zoning district.
         C.   Uses in adjoining zoning districts.
         D.   The applicant's belief that the intended use would be permitted
upon his/her purchase of the land.
         E.   The character standing of the applicant.
         F.   Hardship being demonstrated beyond the context of zoning; for
example, economics.
   (c)   Variations to non-conforming uses and buildings: The Board shall have
no powers to authorize, as a variance, the establishment of a non-conforming
use or extensions of or changes in non-conforming uses. Regulation of existing
non-conforming uses are provided for in Chapter
1127 of this Ordinance.
 
1121.09 CONDITIONS IMPOSED.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to impose additional
conditions and safeguards other than those stated in the Zoning Ordinance when
granting variances. Such additional conditions shall be reasonable and
necessary to promote and preserve the public safety, general welfare, and
economic viability of the neighborhood and community and shall be imposed
solely for the purpose of minimizing the effect of the variance on surrounding
property and the community as a whole. Violations of such conditions and
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted,
shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Section
1117.013.
1121.010 LAPSES OF VARIANCES.
   A variance, once granted, shall not be withdrawn or changed unless there is
a change of circumstances, or if, after the expiration of nine (9) months, no
construction has taken place in accordance with the terms and conditions for
which such variance was granted. Thereafter, the variance shall be deemed null
and void without notification to the applicant or variance holder and all
regulations governing the premises in question shall revert to those in effect
before the variance was granted.
1121.011 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing within twenty (20)
days after the receipt of an application for an appeal or variance from the
Responsible Authority or an applicant.
1121.012 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING IN NEWSPAPER.

conditions shall be transmitted to the Responsible Authority and shall be

      (1)   It has considered and evaluated all available information and
evidence.
      (2)   It has heard all parties in question.
      (3)   Any personal knowledge the Board may have of the subject under
question has been taken into account.
1121.015 DUTIES OF OFFICIALS ON MATTERS OF APPEAL.
   It is the intent of this Code that all questions of interpretation and
enforcement shall first be presented to the Responsible Authority and that such
questions shall be presented to the Zoning Board of Appeals only on appeal from
the decision of the Responsible Authority, and that recourse from the decision
of the Board shall be to the courts as provided by Section
1121.016 and ORC Chapter 713. It is further the intent of this Code that the
duties of Council in connection with this chapter shall not include hearing and
deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise; these
being the powers of the Board. Under this Ordinance, Council shall have only
the duties of considering, adopting, or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of all or part of this Zoning Ordinance, as provided by law and of
establishing a schedule of fees and charges. If, in the course of carrying out
the intent of this chapter and after review of all appeal cases brought before
it, the Board finds a series of similar irregularities or inequities, it shall
be incumbent upon the Board to inform Council and the Planning Commission of
these inadequacies in order that the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Map may be
appropriately amended. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a member of
Council from appealing the decision of the Zoning Board in a court of law.
1121.016 APPEAL TO COURTS.
   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County, Ohio.

Site Plan Review Procedures
1123.01   Conditions for review.
1123.02   Procedure for site plan review.
1123.03   Access control requirements.
1123.04   Traffic Impact Study.
1123.041   Fire safety requirements.
1123.05   Enforcement.
 
1123.01 CONDITIONS FOR REVIEW.
   Site plan review shall be required in any district where the construction,
alteration, or expansion of any principal or accessory building or use is
proposed.
   
1123.02 PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   Formal submission and approval of a site plan is required before any zoning
permit may be issued. Submission and approval of a site plan includes following
the review procedures and submission requirements defined herein.
   An applicant seeking site plan approval shall follow the preliminary and
final review process for site plan review as defined in this Chapter. For
developments also requiring Conditional use approval, the procedure established
in Chapter
1125 shall be followed. The Planning Commission may concurrently address the
issue of site plan approval and consider a recommendation on a Conditional use
approval, and in such case, the approval of the site plan shall be contingent
upon Conditional use approval. If a variance is required, the applicant shall
be required to seek a variance in accordance with Chapter
1121 before submitting plans for formal site plan approval in accordance with
this Chapter.
   (a)   Optional Concept Review: At any time prior to the formal submission
and review of a site plan, an applicant may engage the Planning Commission in
an optional concept review process. In order to receive this review, the
applicant shall submit a sketch site plan to the Planning Commission. The
applicant shall be required to submit the sketch plan at least twenty-one (21)
days before the next scheduled monthly meeting in order to be placed on the
agenda for review. The purpose of such a sketch site plan is to provide an
opportunity to conceptually discuss a proposed development and to provide
general guidance to assist in the preparation of a formal site plan. There are
no applied standards to the site sketch plan, however, the applicant is
encouraged to provide enough detail in order to be able to accurately represent
the concept. All comments and suggestions shall be considered informal by the
applicant and shall not be a binding agreement with the Planning Commission for
approval. This concept review is a service provided to benefit the applicant,
and formal site plan approval is dependent upon the outcome of the Preliminary
Plan Review and Final Site Plan Review described herein.
   (b)   Preliminary Plan Review.
The applicant shall be required to submit a plan for preliminary site plan
review. In order for the application to be deemed complete, the application
form, permit fees, and twelve (12) copies of the plan shall be submitted to the
Responsible Authority at least twenty-one (21) days before the next regularly
scheduled monthly meeting in order to be considered for placement on the agenda
for review. If the applicant fails to provide a complete application as
described herein, the Responsible Authority shall notify the applicant promptly
of the missing items. An additional fee may be required to defray the expenses
associated with the municipal review of the plans, including the need to retain
a registered professional engineer, architect, or landscape architect, or other
professional consultant to advise the Municipality on any or all aspects of the
site plan.
      (1)   A site plan shall be prepared at a scale of one inch equals twenty
feet (1 in. = 20 ft.)(developments more than five (5) acres may be drawn at a
scale of one inch equals fifty feet [1 in. = 50 ft.]), on standard twenty-four
inch by thirty-six inch (24 in. x 36 in.) sheets, with narrative on eight and
one- half inch by eleven inch (8-1/2 in. x 11in.) sheets as necessary. All site
plans shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, architect, or
landscape architect. Minimum information to be provided in the site plan
drawing includes:
         A.   The location of the proposed development in relation to existing
community facilities, thoroughfares, and other transportation modes, shopping
centers, manufacturing establishments, residential development; and existing
natural features such as vegetation, general soil conditions, and topography in
the neighboring area.
         B.   Applicable zoning district/proposed zoning district.
         C.   Width and names of public rights-of-way that are adjacent to the
site and/or will be used for access.
         D.   The layout and acreage of the site and proposed location of all
uses, along with parking areas, and planned access and traffic circulation on
the site, and planned changes that will take place in any existing public
right-of-way.
         E.   The location of all existing and proposed buildings structures on
and adjacent to the site.
         F.   The location of utilities, if available, and the location and
size and capacity of the sewer and water lines that are proposed to serve the
development.
         G.   The scale, title, a north arrow, and date of submission.
         H.   Name, address, phone number, and fax number of all applicants and
their representatives.
         I.   Adjoining land uses and zoning.
      (2)   Responsible Authority Review:
The Responsible Authority shall review the application for compliance to all
applicable Sections of this ordinance within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
the application, based on the information provided in the application. If the
Responsible Authority finds that plan will not comply with this Zoning
Ordinance, the Responsible Authority shall notify the applicant of the
discrepancies of the site plan. If the applicant disagrees with the Responsible
Authority’s decision or chooses to seek a variance, he or she can appeal to the
Zoning Board of Appeals for such relief, as described in Chapter
1121 as a separate process. Submission of the preliminary site plan to the
Planning Commission shall not be permitted unless the Responsible Authority
determines that the plans are in compliance with this ordinance or an appeal or
variance has been granted from the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Planning Commission Review:
The Responsible Authority shall forward the preliminary application to the
Planning Commission for review and discussion, after determining that the
application is complete and the applicant complies with this ordinance, based
on the information required and provided at this stage of review. Within (60)
days of receipt of the preliminary application and plan from the Responsible

and checked for compliance with the imposed conditions.
1123.03 ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   General standards for parking areas, circulation, and access shall be
incorporated as part of the site plan. These standards are found in Chapter
1177 of this Ordinance. As part of the site plan review process, access shall
be reviewed relative to the distance from other drive approaches and from
roadway intersections. The preferred method of providing access to parcels is
to minimize or eliminate driveways by using service roads, rear access roads,
or shared driveways. The Planning Commission may, as part of the site plan
review process, require that driveways be moved, combined, re-aligned, or
eliminated to reduce the potential for accidents.
    (a)   Conditional Approval of Driveways.
As part of the site plan review process, the Planning Commission may approve a
site plan with a specific driveway location, with the condition that an
agreement be first entered into between the property owner and the Municipality
of Wellington requiring that if a service road is constructed in the future, or
if the opportunity for a shared driveway should present itself with development
of adjacent property, one (1) or more approved driveways shall be closed and
measurements taken to utilize such service road or shared drive. Approval of
driveways may also include restrictions on turning movements, locations, or
other requirements to ensure safe and efficient traffic movement.
   (b)   Construction and Use of Service Roads.
When a service road is required, such improvement shall be constructed by the
developer of the involved property before any zoning occupancy or zoning use
permit is granted. When a service road is provided, all access to an adjacent
property shall use that service road and no direct access to the main
thoroughfare shall be provided.
(Ord. 1999-37. Passed 11-15-99.)
   (c)   Route 58 Access Control. In addition to the foregoing limitations, for
any property located north of Maple Street which is also abutting State Route
58 or south of Kent Street which is also abutting State Route 58, no new
driveway/curb cut shall be allowed directly onto State Route 58 if an alternate
public road or a service road or shared driveway is available to serve the
property; if such alternate access is not currently available, a conditional
approval for direct assess to State Route 58 may be granted by the Planning
Commission, provided however, that such access shall be abandoned whenever in
the future the Planning Commission determines that a reasonable access
alternative to State Route 58 is available to the property.
(Ord. 2007-51. Passed 11-5-07.)
1123.04 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   A traffic impact study shall be a requirement for site plan review if the
expected trip generation of the use is one hundred (100) or more cars per hour
as identified in the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Manual. A traffic
impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional engineer at the
developer's expense. The traffic impact study shall investigate the feasibility
and benefits of improvements such as signals, turn lanes, driveway movement
limitations, and other relevant information to the site to protect the safety
of the traveling public. The traffic impact study shall include the following
elements:
   (a)   A description of the site and study area.
   (b)   Anticipated development of adjacent parcels.
   (c)   Trip generation and distribution, including a description of all
assumptions used to generate findings of trip distribution.
   (d)   Modal split (if applicable).
   (e)   Traffic assignment resulting from the development.
   (f)   Projected future traffic volumes.
   (g)   An assessment of the impact that would result from driveway
alternatives.
   (h)   Recommendations for site access and transportation improvements needed
to maintain traffic flow within and past the site at an acceptable and safe
level of service.
   (i)   An evaluation of the effects the proposed development will have on the
level of service and roadway capacity.
1123.041 FIRE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The applicant shall be required to submit a copy of the conceptual,
preliminary and final site plan to the Fire Chief of the Wellington Community
Fire District for review and comment.
   (b)   All site plans shall identify locations of all utility shut-offs,
sprinkler stand pipes locations, Fire Department connections, fire
extinguishers, lock box locations, location of material safety data sheets,
service and overhead doors, location of the fire alarm control panel (FACP) and
the location of all fire lanes. Upon approval of the final site plan an 8 ½ x
11 drawing shall be submitted to the Fire District identifying the location of
the above items.
(Ord. 2000-62. Passed 1-8-01.)
1123.05 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Municipality of Wellington may require the posting of a bond or other
similar performance guarantee to ensure compliance with the plan and stated
conditions of approval. It may suspend any zoning permit when work is not
performed as required. Site plan approval issued under this Section shall lapse
within one (1) year if a substantial use thereof has not commenced, except for
good cause.

1125.01 PURPOSE.
   It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of uses are
appearing daily and that many of these and some other more conventional uses
possess characteristics of such unique and special nature relative to location,
design, size, method of operation, circulation, and public facilities that each
specific use must be considered individually. These specific uses are
classified as “conditional uses” in each zoning district, and because of their
special nature, may be permitted according to procedures outlined in this
chapter.
1125.02 APPLICATION FOR A CONDITIONAL USE.
   An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the Planning
Commission by at least one (1) owner or lessee of property for which such
conditional use is proposed. At a minimum, the application shall contain the
following information:
   (a)   Name, address, phone number, and fax number of applicants.
   (b)   Legal description of property.
   (c)   Description of existing use.
   (d)   Present zoning district.
   (e)   Description of proposed conditional use.
   (f)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading area, traffic access and traffic
circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service areas, utilities,
signs, yards and such other information as the Planning Commission may require
to determine if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirement
of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (g)   A narrative statement evaluating the economic effects on adjoining
property; the effect of such elements as noise, glare, flashing lights, odor,
fumes, and vibration on adjoining property; a discussion of the general
compatibility with adjacent and other properties in the district; and the
relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan.
   (h)   Such other information as may be required.
   (i)   Names and addresses of all owners of record of abutting parcels. (Ord.
2012-10. Passed 4-2-12.)
1125.03 STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CONDITIONAL USES.
   In addition to the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses,
the Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of
each proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
   (a)   Must be, in fact, a conditionally permitted use in the zoning district
where the permit is sought.
   (b)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives,
or with any specific objective of the Municipality's Comprehensive Plan and/or
the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area.
   (d)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses.
   (e)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewers and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
   (f)   Will not create additional requirements at public cost for public
facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of
the community.
   (g)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare, or odors.
   (h)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be designed
so as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public streets
or roads.
   (i)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
1125.04 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any conditional use, the Planning Commission may prescribe
appropriate other conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning
Ordinance. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Ordinance and punishable, as allowed in Section
1117.013.
1125.05 PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE.
   (a)   Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing
within thirty-five (35) days from the receipt of the properly completed
application for a conditional use.
 
   (b)   Notice. Before holding the public hearing, notice of such hearing
shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation of the
Municipality at least ten (10) days before the date of such hearing. The notice
shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the
proposed conditional use.
1125.06 NOTICE TO PARTIES OF INTEREST.
   Before holding the public hearing, written notice of such hearing shall be
mailed by the Responsible Authority, by first class mail, at least ten (10)
days before the day of the hearing to all parties of interest. The notice shall
contain the same information as required of notices published in newspapers as
specified in this chapter.
1125.07 EXPIRATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular
conditional use and such permit shall automatically expire without notice if,
for any reason, the conditional use shall cease for more than six (6) months.

1127.01 GENERAL.
   The lawful use of a building or parcel of land existing at the time of the
adoption of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued, although such use of a
building or parcel of land does not conform to the provisions hereof, provided
no structural alterations are made other than those ordered by an authorized
public officer to assure the safety of the building or structure and provided
further, that such extension does not displace any residence use in a residence
district. A non-conforming use may be extended, changed, or enlarged in
accordance with the provisions found in this chapter.
1127.02 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any R-Residential District, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Ordinance, a single family dwelling may be erected on any
single lot of record not less than sixty-six feet (66 ft.) In width, existing
at the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, provided
that yard requirements of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located. A variance shall not be required for a
permit unless yard requirements are to be altered.
1127.03 STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CHANGE OF NON-CONFORMING USES AND BUILDINGS.
   Any change in the use of a building or lot from a non-conforming use to
another non- conforming use shall require approval by the Planning Commission,
who shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each change in a
non-conforming use application in terms of the following standards.
   (a)   Adequate evidence shall be required which shows that the following
statements are true when considering changes to a non-conforming use:
      (1)   If the change is a non-conforming use, then the proposed non-

center lines or street lines of streets, or of the center lines or right-of-way
lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as parallel
thereto and at such distance therefore as indicated on the Official Zoning Map.
If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the

of water, said boundary line shall be deemed to be at the limit of the
jurisdiction of the Municipality of Wellington, unless otherwise indicated.
   (f)   In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the Map
accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance shall be determined by
dimension notes on the Map or by the use of the scale appearing on the Map.

their annexation shall be classified as being in whichever district established
by this Ordinance most closely resembles the zoning district that existed in
the annexation.

ninety (90) days, conduct a public hearing on the matter of a Municipal zoning
classification.
1129.09 ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS.

1115.02(106)
 
1165.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to achieve, to
the greatest possible degree, land development that is responsive to the
natural and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site. The PUD
provides an alternative zoning category that is intended to encourage
imaginative design of development. The PUD should be a well-integrated
development in terms of major design elements such as roads, drainage systems,
utilities, and open space. The PUD allows greater design flexibility so that
natural features may be protected and development concentrated in an innovative
and efficient manner.
1165.02 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PUD DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
   Subsequent to the approval of the Municipal Council, the designation of PUD
may be applied to any existing zoning district, with the limitations described
herein. There are two (2) types of PUDs:
   (a)   A PUD may be a predominantly residential development and, in which
case, is referred to as a PUD-RS. A PUD-RS may only be applied to an existing
residential district. The tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD-RS
must be owned, leased, or controlled by one (1) person or single entity and
must be at least five (5) contiguous acres in size.
   (b)   A PUD may also be a mixed use development, referred to as a PUD-MX. A
PUD- MX may be applied to any existing non-residential zoning district. The
tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD-MX must be owned, leased, or
controlled by one (1) person or single entity and must be at least five (5)
contiguous acres in size.
   (c)   A PUD must conform to the existing comprehensive and thoroughfare
plans.
   Upon the approval of the final development plan according to this chapter,
the Official Municipal Zoning Map shall be amended to designate the property
“PUD-RS” or “PUD-MX.”
1165.03 PERMITTED USES.
   The permitted uses in both the PUD-RS and PUD-MX district are as set forth
below:
   (a)   Permitted Uses - PUD-RS.
An applicant may propose to include any mixture of permitted or conditional
uses in any existing residential district. Additionally, an applicant may
propose land uses which are allowed as a permitted use in the GB district,
provided that not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the net acres in the
development is devoted to non-residential uses.
   (b)   Permitted Uses - PUD-MX.
An applicant may propose to include any mixture of non-residential land uses in
a proposed PUD-MX development, provided that at least sixty percent (60%) of
the net acres in the development are devoted to uses permitted in the district
(s) applying to the property at the time of application. If the subject
property is being annexed into the municipality and no existing zoning district
is applicable, any combination of non-residential land uses may be proposed.
1165.04 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following standards represent broad parameters under which all PUD
developments must be designed:
   (a)   Central Water and Sewer Facilities.
All structures in developments approved as a PUD must be served by central
public water and sewer facilities. (No package waste water treatment plants or
separate water supply systems, private or public.)
   (b)   Development Layout and Design.
The design and layout of all PUDs shall display excellence in design by
properly considering significant site features, such as topography, natural
drainage patterns, roadway access and circulation, surrounding land uses, and
general public welfare to result in desirable land development. Attractive
landscaped buffers shall be provided between incompatible land uses and
activities.
   (c)   Front, Side, and Rear Setback Standards for Perimeter Lots.
All lots that are located along the perimeter of the PUD shall have minimum
front, side and rear setbacks equal to those that would normally be specified
in the zoning district prevailing at the time of application for PUD approval
or twenty-five feet (25 ft.), whichever is greater.
   (d)   Off-Street Parking and Loading Facilities.
For all land uses located within the PUD, the parking and loading standards
contained in Chapter
1143 shall be applied.
1165.05 RESIDENTIAL (PUD-RS) DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
In addition to the general development standards described in Section
1165.04 above, residential PUDs shall meet the following development standards:
   (a)   Clustering Residential Development and Required Open Space.
Clustering residential density is encouraged to provide required common open
space. A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the land developed for residential
purposes in a PUD-RS project shall be reserved for common open space. This
required amount of common space shall be established as common open space,
under one ownership, and provision shall be established for maintenance and
care. The legal articles relating to any organization of property owners in the
development charged with such open space maintenance shall be submitted to the
Municipality and publicly recorded with Lorain County Recording Office. The
Municipal Council may require as a condition of final approval, any evidence
deemed necessary to document that the required common space will remain in its
stated condition as long as the development exists (including such as legal
documents, deed restrictions, conservation easements, etc.).
   (b)   Clustering Residential Density.
To achieve a clustering of residential density and to provide for the required
common open space, the lot area requirements for residential land uses may be
reduced from the densities required under the district(s) applying to the
property at the time of application by up to twenty percent (20%). The lot
width and yard requirements for residential lots may also be reduced as needed
to accommodate a variety of structural patterns, clustering designs, and
housing types.
   (c)   Residential Dwelling Types.
Along with clustering residential density, a PUD-RS may include a mixture of
dwelling types, including single-family detached dwellings, two-family units,
zero lot-line units, and multiple-family units provided the maximum density
requirements of Section
1165.05 (b) are not exceeded.
1165.06 GENERAL PUD APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   The applicant for a PUD is encouraged to informally present conceptual plans
to both the Planning Commission and Municipal Council for review prior to
extensive engineering. Plans may include the proposal to phase construction of
the PUD development. Property proposed to be developed as a PUD must be rezoned
to PUD; and the decision to approve a final development plan and to rezone a
property to PUD are done concurrently. The PUD review process must satisfy all
of the applicable requirements of Section
1123.02
1165.07 FINAL PLAN.
   The applicant for a PUD shall submit twelve (12) copies of the proposed
Final Plan to the Responsible Authority along with the required application
fee.
   (a)   The final plan shall include the following:
      (1)   The specific description of permitted, conditionally permitted, and
accessory uses to be allowed in each area of the development.
      (2)   A copy of proposed deed restrictions.
      (3)   The final plan shall be drawn to illustrate:
         A.   A survey and legal description of the proposed development site,
showing dimensions and bearings of the property lines; area in acres,
topography (at two foot [2 ft.], contour intervals); and existing features of
the development site, including major wooded areas, streets, easements, utility
lines, existing land uses.
         B.   The location and dimensions of all lots, setbacks, and building
envelopes.
         C.   Conceptual drawings of sewer and water facilities, as well as
street and drainage systems.
         D.   A table indicating acreage devoted to various development types.
      (4)   Landscaping plan for all buffers and other common areas.
      (5)   Architectural guidelines to apply throughout the development.
      (6)   The proposed names of all interior streets proposed for the
development.
      (7)   Layout and dimensions of all parking and loading areas along with
an indication of what they are to be built to serve.
      (8)   A description of the expected timing of the development with
phasing.
      (9)   Development name.
In addition to the above, the Municipal Council may require additional
information, including environmental impact studies and archaeological surveys
prepared by appropriate professionals to document the impacts of the
development and to address potential mitigation measures. The applicant shall
be responsible for reasonable expenses incurred by the Municipality in
reviewing final development plans. Such expenses are beyond application fees
established by the Municipality and may include professional service fees such
as legal expenses or fees from other professionals, such as engineers,
landscape architects, planners, or environmental scientists incurred in
connection with reviewing the plans submitted.
   (b)   Final Plan and Rezoning Approval Procedure Process.
The decision to rezone land to PUD and to approve the final plan are
accomplished concurrently. All PUD final plan submissions are deemed to be an
application for amendment to the Zoning Code according to Chapter
1119. All procedures (Planning Commission Review, public hearings and action by
the Council), therein shall be followed in considering an application for a
rezoning of the land in question to PUD. Upon approval of such plan and
rezoning, the Municipal Zoning map shall be amended to designate the project
area as “PUD-RS” or “PUD-MX.” Thereafter, with the concurrent approval of the
rezoning and final plan pursuant to the criteria stated in Section I, all
development restrictions and conditions described in the final plan shall
become official requirements of the PUD.
   (c)   Criteria of Approval - Final Plan.
The Planning Commission and Municipal Council shall review the proposed Final
Plan according to the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed document is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the master plan.
      (2)   That the proposed development advances the general health, safety,
and morals of the Municipality.
      (3)   That the interior road system, proposed parking, and any off-site
improvements are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic generated
by and within the proposed development.
      (4)   That any exception from standard district requirements can be
warranted by design and other amenities incorporated in the final development
plan according to these PUD requirements.
      (5)   That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned
in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
      (6)   That the existing and proposed utilities, including water and sewer
service, and drainage plan will be adequate for the population densities and
non- residential uses proposed in the PUD.
1165.08 AMENDMENT (CHANGES).
   After the final development plan has been approved by the Municipal Council,
adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, parking areas, entrances, heights,
or yards may be requested by the proponents. Minor changes, as defined herein,
are allowed, provided such requests conform to the standards established by the
final development plan and this Ordinance. A minor change shall require
approval by the Planning Commission and shall include the following:
   (a)   Adjustments to the size and location of buildings, swimming pools, and
other on- site structures provided:
      (1)   They do not result in an increase in the number of housing units
approved in the final plan.
      (2)   They do not encroach into the established setback areas.
      (3)   They do not create a larger building mass either through an
increase in their height or length that would magnify their effect on the
adjoining areas.
   (b)   Alterations to the proposed drives and/or parking areas if they do not
encroach into building areas or specified recreation areas.
   (c)   Adjustments in the size and location of development identification
signs.
   A major change is any change that does not meet the criteria above and, in
addition, is one which would constitute a significant alteration in the basic
plan design or result in a use different from those originally intended. A
major change shall require submittal of a final plan as defined in Section
1165.07 of that portion of the development proposed to undergo a major change.

line shall be the uniform setback line observed on the same side of the street
as the lot in question between two intersecting streets or for a distance of
100 feet on each side of the lot. In the event of variance of the abutting
property, the setback that is nearest to thirty-five feet from the right-of-way
line shall prevail as the minimum setback.
      (2)   All buildings, including accessory buildings, shall not cover more
than the indicated percent of the lot.
1167.02 SETBACK LINES IN GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICTS.
   Notwithstanding the front setback requirements set forth in Section
1167.01 of the Codified Ordinances,
   (a)   With respect to property which is located within a GB-1 General
Business District and which also directly abuts either State Route 58 or State
Route 18, the setback from that State Route shall be at least one hundred feet
(100'), regardless of whether it is denominated a front, side, or rear yard in
the way it is developed or configured.
   (b)   With respect to property which does not directly abut, front, or
provide traffic access onto either State Route 58 or State Route 18 and which
is located within a GB-1 General Business District, the Planning Commission
shall have the authority to allow a front setback of less than one hundred feet
(100'), but under no circumstances less than fifty feet (50'), provided that:
      (1)   There are no specific conditions concerning the property which
would reasonably necessitate the full one hundred foot (100') setback (for
example, traffic flow, fire department access, utility lines, etc.); and
      (2)   The setback allowed is generally consistent with the setback line
observed on the same side of the street between two intersecting streets or for
a distance of one hundred feet (100') on each side of the lot; and
      (3)   The property is otherwise developed in compliance with the yard and
lot coverage requirements of this Code; and
      (4)   If the property is located in general proximity to either State
Route 58 or State Route 18, then regardless of the way the property is
developed or configured, and regardless of whether the yard is a front yard,
rear yard, or side yard, there shall be a minimum of one hundred feet (100')
between any building and State Route 58 or State Route 18, as applicable.

   1171.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Wellington, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Wellington has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Wellington as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Wellington.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Lorain County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective August 19, 2008.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Wellington as required by Section
1171.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Planning Commission 115 Willard Memorial Square
Wellington, Ohio 44090.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Wellington, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2008-
15. Passed 6-2-08.)
   1171.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register; and/or
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; and/or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; and/or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Wellington’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Wellington
Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 4, 1980, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2008-15. Passerd 6-2-08.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village of Wellington's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
 1171.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1171.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Village of
Wellington, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Wellington have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Wellington's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Wellington boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Wellington suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Wellington has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1171.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.

Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Wellington specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section 3.10(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in
the relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

   1171.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village of Wellington Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby
appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
Village Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed at the
Planning Commission 115 Willard Memorial Square Wellington, Ohio 44090.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 10 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
Wellington.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Lorain Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2008-15. Passed 6-2-08.)

1173.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of general district regulations is to establish additional
requirements for various uses, classifications of uses, or areas in order to
promote the harmonious exercise of property rights without conflict. The
general district regulations as set forth herein shall apply to all districts,
unless otherwise noted herein. Where the requirements of a general district
regulation and a district regulation differ, the more specific/restrictive
requirement shall prevail.
1173.02 CONVERSION OF DWELLING TO MORE UNITS.
   A residence shall not be converted to accommodate an increased number of
dwelling units unless:
   (a)   The yard dimensions continue to meet the yard dimensions required by
the Zoning Ordinance for new structures in that district.
   (b)   The lot area per dwelling equals the lot area requirements for new
structures in that district.
   (c)   The floor area per dwelling unit is not reduced to less than that
which is required for new construction in that district.
   (d)   The conversion is otherwise in compliance with this Ordinance (e.g.,
property is zoned for double- or multiple-family use) and all other relevant
codes and Ordinances.
1173.03 GENERAL LOT AREA REGULATIONS.
   No parcel of land shall hereafter be reduced or divided so as to provide
less than the minimum lot size required in the district in which such land is
situated.
   (a)   Minimum Lot Area. The minimum lot area without central water and sewer
services shall be one (1) acre per family for single-family dwellings unless a
larger lot size is required by the Lorain County Health Board due to soil
conditions.
   (b)   Non-Conforming Existing Lot of Record. Any lot or parcel of land under
one ownership and of record at the time of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or
any amendment hereto, may be used as a building site even when of less area or
width than that required by the regulations for the district in which located.
All applicable setbacks and other development standards shall apply to non-
conforming existing lots.
   (c)   Setback Regulations for Corner Lots. On a corner lot, the principal
building and its accessory structures shall be required to have the same
setback distance from all street right-of-way lines as required for the front
yard in the district in which the structures are located.
   (d)   Reduction of Area or Space. No lot, yard, parking area, or other space
shall be reduced in area or dimension if such reduction has the effect of
making the lot, yard, parking area, or other space less than the minimum
required by this Ordinance. Furthermore, any lot, yard, parking area, or other
space which is already less than the required minimum shall not be reduced
further. However, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to limit the
power of the Board of Zoning Appeals in properly granting variances under this
Ordinance.
1173.04 GENERAL YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to all yard requirements specified in Chapter
1167 and in other sections of this Ordinance, the provisions of Section
1173.04, inclusive, shall be used for interpretation and clarification. Except
as herein provided, every required yard shall be a required open space other
than a court unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or portion of a
structure from three (3) feet above the general ground level of the graded lot
upward, provided, accessories, ornaments, and furniture may be permitted in any
yard, subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of
visibility.
   (a)   Yard Requirements for Single Buildings.  No required yard or other
open space around a building shall be considered as a yard to open space for
any other building. No required yard or other required open space on an
adjoining lot shall be considered as providing the yard or open space on the
lot whereon a building is to be erected or established.
   (b)   Yard Requirements for Multiple-Family Dwellings.  Multiple-family
dwellings shall be considered as one (1) building for the purpose of
determining front, side, and rear yard requirements. The entire group as a unit
shall require one (1) front, one (1) rear, and two (2) side yards as specified
for dwellings in the appropriate district. Each individual building shall meet

1179.01 LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   Consistent with the objectives established in this chapter, landscaping
shall be provided according to the following standards for the following
districts, with the new construction, enlargement, addition, or alteration of
any principal building:
 
MR-1 Multiple-Family Residential District
NB-1 Neighborhood Business District
GB-1 General Business District
CB-1 Central Business District
LI-1 Light Industrial District
HI-1 Heavy Industrial District
IP-1 Industrial Park
ID-1 Institutional Development District
PUD Planned Unit Development
1179.02 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   The Municipality of Wellington shall recognize that, in some cases, the
landscaping requirements may be difficult or impractical to meet due to
specific site characteristics. In these cases, an alternate landscaping plan
may be approved by the Planning Commission as part of the site plan review
process.
1179.03 SCREENING OF SERVICE COURTS, STORAGE AREAS, AND LOADING DOCKS.
   For all uses that include areas used for service, loading, and unloading
activities, such areas shall be screened along the entire rear lot line and
side lot lines from the rear lot line to the rear building line to the
following minimum standards:
   (a)   The width of the screening area shall be a minimum of five feet (5
ft.). Screening shall consist of walls, hedges, fences, vegetation, or an
acceptable combination of these elements, provided that screening must be at
least seven feet (7 ft.) in height.
   (b)   Vegetation used for screening shall have a minimum capacity of
seventy-five percent (75%) at all times within two (2) years of planting.
1179.04 SCREENING OF TRASH CONTAINER RECEPTACLES.
   Trash containers shall be screened according to the following minimum
standards:
   (a)   Trash containers designed to service more than one (1) residential
unit or to service a non-residential structure shall be screened on three (3)
sides by walls, fences, or natural vegetation or an acceptable combination of
these elements.
   (b)   The height of such screening shall be at least six feet (6 ft.). The
maximum height of walls and fences shall not exceed ten feet (10 ft.).
Vegetation shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventy-five percent (75%) at all
times within two (2) years of planting. The use of evergreen vegetation is
encouraged. Vegetation shall be a variety and size that will attain six feet (6
ft.) in height within two (2) years of planting.
1179.05 INTERIOR PARKING AREA LANDSCAPING.
   Landscaping within parking areas, whether ground cover or upright plant
material, is necessary not only to reduce the generation of heat and water
runoff, but to break up visually the expanse of paved areas. The use of parking
islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking lot is
required to landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in these
landscape areas is encouraged. Any open parking area containing more than six
thousand square feet (6,000 sq. ft.) of area or fifteen (15) or more parking
spaces shall provide the following interior landscaping in addition to the
required perimeter screening:
   (a)   An area equal to five percent (5%) of the total area devoted to
parking space and parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.
   (b)   Whenever possible, large parking areas of thirty thousand square feet
(30,000 sq. ft.) or larger shall be designed so as to break up their visual
expanse and create the appearance of smaller parking lots. This distinction or
separation can be achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in
strategic areas and by taking advantage of natural features such as slope,
existing woodland or vegetation, drainage courses, and retention/detention
areas that contain water throughout the year.
   (c)   Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in
peninsulas or islands. The minimum island or peninsula size shall be one
hundred eighty square feet (180 sq. ft.) with a two-foot (2 ft.) minimum
distance between all trees or shrubs and the edge of pavement where vehicles
overhang and should have a minimum width of ten feet (10 ft.). Islands shall
typically be located every ten (10) to twelve (12) parking spaces and may be
curbed.
   (d)   The required plant materials for the interior of parking areas shall
be one (1) deciduous tree for every three thousand square feet (3,000 sq. ft.).
Where site distance or maneuvering conflicts exist, trees shall have a clear
trunk of at least five feet (5 ft.) above the ground, and the remaining
required landscape areas shall be planted with shrubs or ground cover not to
exceed two feet (2 ft.) in height.
   (e)   Areas located between any parking area and public right-of-way shall
be landscaped with elements such as mounding, trees, ground cover, and shrubs.
1179.06 PLANT MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following Sections include specifications for plant materials.
Alternatives to these materials that can be shown to meet both the intent and
requirements of this Ordinance may be approved as part of a site plan:
   (a)   Shrubs: Shrubs shall be at least twenty-four inches (24 in.) average
height and spread at the time of planting and, where required for screening,
shall form a continuous, year-round, solid visual screen within five (5) years
after planting.
   (b)   Ground Cover and Grass: Ground cover shall be planted a minimum of
eight inches (8 in.) on center and shall be planted in such a manner to present
a finished appearance and seventy-five percent (75%) coverage after one (1)
complete growing season. If approved as part of a Site Plan, ground cover may
also consist of rocks, pebbles, wood chips, and other material. Grass shall be
planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns.
   (c)   Prohibited Tree Species: Within any required landscaping, the
following tree species may not be used:
 
Box Elder      Tree of Heaven   Catalpa
Black Walnut      Poplar         Willow
Mountain Ash      Siberian Elm      Black Locust
Hickory      Mulberry
In addition to the species listed above, trees which produce nuts, seeds, or
fruit that can create a hazard to pedestrians or vehicles, shall not be planted
in such a manner that the natural dripline of an average adult tree of the
species planted will be any closer than three feet (3 ft.) of a pedestrian
walkway or parking lot.
1179.07 SCREENING OF EXTERIOR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.
   Exterior components of plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and
ventilating systems (including, but not limited to piping, tanks, stacks,
collectors, heating, cooling, and ventilating- equipment fans, blowers,
ductwork, vents, louvers, meters, compressors, motors, incinerators, ovens,
etc.) shall not be directly visible at ground level. Any landscaping or
structural means employed to screen exterior components of plumbing,
processing, heating, cooling, and ventilating systems from direct view shall
appear as integrated parts of the buildings; shall be constructed of
complementary and durable materials; and finished in a texture and color scheme
complementary to the overall architectural design. Any exterior components of
plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and ventilating systems, and their
screening devices which will be visible from upper floors of adjacent buildings
shall be kept to a visible minimum; shall be installed in a neat and compact
fashion; and shall be painted such a color as to allow their blending with
their visual backgrounds.
1179.08 MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner shall be responsible for maintaining all landscaping in good
condition to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. This should be
accomplished by the following standards:
   (a)   All plant growth in landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning,
trimming, or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere
with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise
constitute a hazard.
   (b)   All planted areas shall be maintained in a weed-free condition, clear
of undesirable undergrowth; and free from refuse and debris.
   (c)   Replacement plants shall conform to the standards that govern original
installation. Dead or unhealthy plants shall be replaced within the next
planting season.
   (d)   Representatives of the Municipality of Wellington shall have the
authority to inspect landscaping and check it against the approved plan on
file.

1182.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF A DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   A Design Review Board is hereby established which shall have the
authority to issue Design Approval Certificates to those persons who have made
application to carry on activities in the Design Review District for which
Design Approval Certificates are required.
   (b)   Whenever an application is submitted to the Building Inspector or
Zoning Inspector for any permit relative to any new construction,
reconstruction, remodeling, or deconstruction, which would have an impact on
the outside appearance of a structure, said Inspector shall first ascertain
whether the premises is located within the Design Review District; and, if it
is so located, the Inspector shall designate on any permit which he issues that
the same is also subject to obtaining a design approval certificate from the
Design Review Board before work on the premises may commence. Any permit issued
by the Building Inspector or Zoning Inspector for work that is subject to a
design approval certificate shall be deemed contingent upon the issuance of a
design approval certificate.
(Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.04 COMPOSITION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   The Design Review Board shall be composed of five (5) members, all
residents of the Village, appointed by the Mayor with the consent of Village
Council. At least two (2) of the members shall be persons owning property in
the Design Review District or having a leasehold on such property lasting at
least one year from the time of their appointment. Three (3) members shall
constitute a quorum. A majority vote of the entire Board (3) shall be necessary
to pass any motion, unless one or more members of the Board are required to
abstain from voting, in which case a majority of the remaining voting members
shall suffice.
   (b)   The Board shall meet at least once during each January and at the call
of the Chairman as needed. Meetings shall be open to the public. The Secretary
of the Board shall keep minutes of the Proceedings of the Board; and they shall
be certified as correct and filed with the Clerk of Council's office as public
records.
(Ord. 2012-13. Passed 5-7-12.)
   (c)   Members' terms shall be for five (5) years with one term expiring each
year. Initial appointments shall be for terms of one, two, three, four, and
five years, with subsequent appointments for five years. The chairman shall be
appointed annually by the Mayor from among the five Board members. No member of
the Board shall participate in the review of any application if such member has
any direct financial interest or is a tenant in the property under discussion.
(Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.05 DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   The Design Review Board shall review all applications for a Design Approval
Certificate and approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications each
application. In reviewing applications, the Board shall use the following
standards:
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
   (b)   Contemporary design shall not be discouraged when it is compatible
with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property,
neighborhood, or environment.
   (c)    When demolition of a structure is proposed, the Board shall review
such proposed action and identify any feasible alternatives. The Design Review
Board shall assist the property owner in exploring options to preserve the
structure. A Design Approval Certificate shall be issued when it is found
either that the structure contains no significant architectural or historical
features, or that the structure no longer has any reasonable economic use
because deterioration has progressed to the point that rehabilitation is no
longer a prudent alternative to demolition.
   (d)    Where demolition of structures having common walls with adjoining
structures is proposed, the Board must ascertain that the structural stability
of such common walls will be preserved. If common walls are to be permanently
exposed as a result of demolition, the newly exposed areas must be finished to
present the appearance of acceptable exterior walls.
   (e)    The design of new structures, including new site improvements, shall
take into account the architectural style, general design, arrangement,
texture, material, and color of other structures and premises within the Design
Review District.
   (f)    All new structures and all reconstruction of existing structures
shall use natural traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry
and wood, where possible.
   (g)   The responsible authority and the Design Review Board shall, at a
minimum, enforce the Secretary of the Interior's "standards" for the treatment
of historic property as set forth in 36 CFR, Part 68; and the same are hereby
adopted by this Council. The responsible authority and the Design Review Board
shall consider the Department of the Interior's "Guidelines for Preserving,
Rehabilitating, Restoring and Reconstructing Historic Buildings," as they
pertain to exterior work, in connection with the enforcement of the standards.
A copy of the standards and guidelines shall be maintained by the responsible
authority for public review.
      (Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.06 ADDITIONAL DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS.   
   In addition to the above standards, the Design Review Board may develop more
specific design review standards that address and illustrate acceptable
building designs. The Design Review Board shall also develop forms and
submission requirements related to the issuance of a Design Approval
Certificate; this shall include a requirement that the applicant provide the
name and address of the owners of record of all real property which is either
adjacent to or within a 100 foot radius of the subject property. Village
Council shall approve any such standards and submission requirements before use
by the Design Review Board.
(Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.07 DESIGN APPROVAL CERTIFICATE REQUIRED.
   (a)   A Design Approval Certificate is required prior to beginning:
      (1)   Any new construction of a building or structure;
      (2)   The demolition of any structure unless a qualified Responsible
Authority has declared that a structure is unsafe and in danger of causing
damage to adjoining property or the public at large;
      (3)   Any remodeling which involves the alteration of any exterior design
feature, including a foundation, alteration of a roofline, the construction or
enclosure of any porch, deck or breeze way, the replacement of windows, or
siding;
      (4)   The placement, replacement or reconstruction of any sign;
      (5)   The addition or replacement of doors, awnings, canopies, or other
exterior design features or materials;
      (6)   Exterior painting when colors are changed.
   (b)   A Design Approval Certificate is required regardless of whether a
building permit or zoning permit is required. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any property.
   (c)   The responsible authority shall have the authority to issue a "stop
work" order to any individual performing work either without having obtained a
certificate required under this chapter or in a manner contrary to the
requirements of the certificate.
(Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.08 PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Applications for a Design Approval Certificate shall be filed with the
Responsible Authority. An applicant shall complete such an application fully.
The failure to fully disclose the nature of the proposed project shall be
considered as if no application has been submitted. Any substantial deviation
from the project as disclosed to the Board shall require that a new application
be submitted. The Design Review Board shall meet within ten (10) business days
following the submission of a complete application. The responsible authority
shall cause notice to be given to the nearby property owners identified in the
application; however, the failure of any such individual to actually receive
notice shall not prevent the Design Review Board from proceeding with an
application. The Board must act on an application within seven (7) calendar
days of its first meeting on the application, unless an extension is agreed to
by the applicant.
   (b)   In the case of a proposed project which is described in Section
1182.07(a)(1) or (2) (i.e., new construction or demolition), the Design Review
Board shall review and approve, disapprove, or modify applications, and upon
such approval or approval with modifications, shall issue a design approval
certificate reflecting any mandatory terms or conditions.
   (c)   In the case of a proposed project which is otherwise described in
Section
1182.07 (e.g., remodeling, etc.), if the applicant has complied with the
applicable filing requirements, the Design Review Board shall, within seven
days of its meeting as specified in subsection (a), above, make recommendations
to the applicant relative to the proposed project.
      (1)   If the applicant agrees with the recommendations, the agreed plan
shall be committed to writing, executed by the applicant and a representative
of the Design Review Board; and such plan shall be deemed to constitute
mandatory terms of the Design Approval Certificate then issued by the Design
Review Board.
      (2)   If the applicant disagrees with the recommendations, the applicant
may appeal the recommendations pursuant to Section
1182.09.
      (3)   A.   If the applicant does not accept the recommendations, the
Board may, nevertheless, endeavor, for a period of no more than 45 days from
the issuance of its recommendations, to obtain the applicant's adoption of an
agreed plan for proceeding with the project (such an agreed plan, if reached,
will be memorialized and become binding, as specified in subsection (1),
above). However, at any time, the Board may formally elect to discontinue such
efforts and proceed under subsection B., below.
         B.   In the event that the Design Review Board determines that all
reasonable means of reaching an agreed plan have been exhausted, or that the 45
days have elapsed without an agreement having been reached, whichever occurs
first, the Design Review Board shall issue a Design Approval Certificate,
indicating that the applicant has been advised of any recommendations for the
proposed project and is nevertheless eligible to proceed with work (subject to
any other lawful requirements).
   (d)    If the work described in any Design Approval Certificate has not
begun within one (1) year from the date of issuance thereof, the certificate
shall be revoked by the responsible authority and written notice thereof shall
be given to the persons affected. If the work described in any Design Approval
Certificate has not been substantially completed within two years of the date
of issuance thereof, it shall be revoked by the responsible authority, and
written notice thereof shall be given to the persons affected, together with
notice that further work as described in the expired certificate shall not
proceed unless and until a new certificate has been obtained or an extension of
not more than six (6) months is granted by the responsible authority. If a
permit is revoked, all work on the project shall cease.
(Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.09 APPEALS.
    An applicant who has been denied a Design Approval Certificate by the
Design Review Board may appeal the decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any
such appeal shall be made within ten (10) days after the Board's decision. Upon
hearing such an appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals may reverse, affirm or
modify the order or determination, and issue a Design Approval Certificate. The
Board of Zoning Appeals shall base its decision on the appeal criteria.
(Ord. 2008-58. Passed 2-2-09.)
1182.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever constructs, reconstructs, alters or demolishes any property subject
to this chapter in violation of this chapter shall be deemed in violation of
this Zoning Code and such violations shall be punishable under Section
1117.013 of the Zoning Code.
