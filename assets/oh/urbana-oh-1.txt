EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Urbana Codified Ordinances was either
ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Urbana Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   SECTION 2.10. READING REQUIREMENTS.
   All legislation shall be deemed to have a reading if furnished to every
Council member and posted publicly by the Clerk at least 24 hours prior to any
Council meeting. The Clerk may give a general description of the legislation at
the meeting without reciting the title verbatim. Resolutions, being of a less
permanent nature, which do not involve the expenditure of funds by the City may
be adopted by a majority vote of the members of Council following a single
reading. Resolutions or Ordinances which involve the expenditure of money shall
require readings at two City Council meetings not less than none week apart
unless any Council member requests the Clerk to read the Ordinance or
Resolution in its entirety. Council may reserve a third reading for any
legislation upon substantive changes to a draft Ordinance or draft Resolution
after a first reading or second reading without treating such legislation as a
first reading.
   Any Ordinance to amend the Codified Ordinances of the City, or to take other
actions not permitted as emergencies, being of a permanent nature, shall
require three readings before passage. Emergency legislation need only be read
once before passage, with no requirement for rule suspension. Otherwise,
Council may suspend the reading rules upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of
the members present at the meeting.
(Amended 11-8-2016)
 
   SECTION 2.11. EMERGENCY ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.

the specific facts necessitating the emergency. Such emergency ordinances or
resolutions shall require no public hearings and shall take effect at the time
indicated therein. Emergency ordinances and resolutions shall be published as
other ordinances and resolutions after passage.
   Each emergency ordinance or resolution shall require the affirmative vote of
at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members elected to Council for its enactment.
If such emergency ordinance or resolution fails to receive the requisite two-
thirds (2/3) affirmative vote, but receives the necessary majority for passage
as a non-emergency ordinance or resolution, it shall take effect as a non-
emergency ordinance or resolution.
(Amended 11-6-90)
 
   SECTION 2.12. ACTIONS NOT PERMITTED AS EMERGENCIES.
   No action of Council authorizing the surrender or joint exercise of its
powers, or in granting a franchise, or in establishing new positions, both
classified and unclassified, or in the enactment, amendment or repeal of any
zoning or building resolution or ordinance, or in the changing of any ward
boundaries, or in authorizing any change in the boundaries of the City, shall
be enacted as an emergency ordinance or resolution.
 
   SECTION 2.13. AMENDING ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   No ordinance or resolution, or section or subsection thereof, shall be
revised or amended unless the ordinance or resolution superseding it contains
the entire ordinance or resolution, or section or subsection thereof, as
revised or amended, and having been revised or amended, the original ordinance
or resolution, or section or subsection thereof, shall be repealed.
 
   SECTION 2.14. AUTHENTICATION OF ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Each ordinance or resolution should be authenticated by the signature of the
Council president, or other presiding officer, and the Clerk of Council. The
failure or refusal of such officers to sign such ordinances or resolutions
shall not invalidate an ordinance or resolution.
 
   SECTION 2.15. EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   Emergency legislation and any legislation adopted on first reading shall
take effect immediately upon approval by the Mayor. Each ordinance or
resolution providing for the appropriation of money, or for the annual tax
levy, or for improvements petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the
adjacent property to be benefitted and especially assessed therefor shall take
effect, unless a later date be specified therein, upon its approval by the
Mayor, or upon the expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the
Mayor, or upon its passage after veto by the Mayor. No other legislation shall
become effective until 14 days after:
   a)   Its approval by the Mayor, or
   b)   The expiration of the time within which it may be vetoed by the Mayor,
or
   c)   Its passage after veto by the Mayor.
(Amended 11-8-2016)
 
   SECTION 2.16. PUBLIC NOTICE BEFORE FINAL ENACTMENT.
   No action of Council authorizing the surrender or joint exercise of any of
its powers, or in the granting of any franchise, or in the enactment, amendment
or repeal of any zoning or building ordinance or resolution, or in the changing
of any ward boundaries, or in the authorizing of any change in the boundaries
of the City shall be enacted unless the title and summary of the ordinance or
resolution has been published in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City at least 7 days before enactment by Council. Those actions of Council
which require public hearings under the general laws of Ohio shall require
public hearings under this Charter unless it is inconsistent with the
provisions of this Charter to require the public hearings.
 
   SECTION 2.17. PUBLICATION OF ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS.
   At least once every 90 days, the Clerk of Council shall submit a list of
legislation adopted by Council to a newspaper of general circulation and/or
digitally within the City and post that list conspicuously in the City building
and online. The list shall fairly describe and summarize the legislation
enacted and announce that the full text of Ordinances and Resolutions are
available for inspection at the office of the Clerk of Council, or the full
text may be provided by a digital or hard copy upon request to the Clerk.
Failure of publication, or any error or omission in publication, shall not
invalidate an Ordinance or Resolution.
   The City shall not be required to advertise through paid publication except
to comply with Ohio Revised Code Section 705.16(B), which requires legal
advertising in a newspaper of general circulation only once upon adoption for a
legislation of a permanent general nature, or providing for public
improvements, or assessing property in the municipal corporation.
(Amended 6-8-1982; 11-8-2016; 11-3-2020)

model ordinance or code prepared and promulgated by a public or private
organization including but not limited to codes and regulations pertaining to
fire, fire hazards, fire prevention, plumbing code, electrical code, building
code, refrigeration machinery code, piping code, boiler code, heating code, air
conditioning code, housing code, and other matters as Council may deem
appropriate by incorporation by reference. The ordinance or resolution adopting
any such code or ordinance shall make reference to the date and source of such
code without reproducing the same at length in the ordinance or resolution. In
such cases, publication of the standard ordinance or code shall not be
required, but at least one copy of such code shall be kept at all times in the
office of the Clerk of Council and available for reference by interested
persons. If the ordinance or code, after its adoption by reference by the
Council, is amended, the Council may adopt the amendment or change by
incorporation by reference in an ordinance or resolution under the same
procedure as is established herein for the adoption of the original code
without the necessity of setting forth in full in the ordinance or resolution
the provisions either of the amendment or change to the original ordinance or
code.
 
   SECTION 2.19. CODIFICATION.
   The Council may revise, codify, recodify, rearrange and publish the

the conduct of any office or department or any affairs of the City.

   Effective with the Council elections of 2010 for terms beginning January 1,
2011, or after, no person shall serve more than three consecutive four year

This limitation shall apply regardless of whether the three consecutive terms

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

         Open meeting law - see Ohio R.C. 121.22
 
 
107.01 MEETINGS OF GOVERNMENTAL BODIES.
   (a)   This section shall be liberally construed to require public officials
to take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business
only in open meetings, unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by
law.
 
   (b)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Public body" means Council or any board, commission, committee,
agency or similar decision-making body of the City, but excluding the Board of
Control.
      (2)   "Meeting" means any prearranged discussion of the public business
of the public body by a majority of its members.
 
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) hereof, all meetings of
any public body are declared to be public meetings open to the public at all
times. A member of a public body shall be present in person at a meeting open
to the public to be considered present or to vote at the meeting and for
purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting.
The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any such public body shall be
promptly recorded and open to public inspection. The minutes need only reflect
the general subject matter of discussions in executive sessions authorized
under subsection (e) hereof.
 
   (d)   Every public body shall, by rule, establish a reasonable method
whereby any person may determine the time and place, and purpose of all special
meetings. A public body shall not hold a special meeting unless it gives at
least twenty-four hours advance notice to the new media that have requested
notification, except in the event of an emergency requiring immediate official
action. In the event of an emergency, the member or members calling the meeting
shall notify the new media that have requested notification immediately of the
time, place and purpose of the meeting.
   The rule shall provide that any person may, upon request and payment of a
reasonable fee, obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at which
any specific type of public business is to be discussed. Provisions for advance
notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the agenda of
meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in self-
addressed, stamped envelopes provided by the person.
 
   (e)   The members of a public body may hold an executive session only after
a majority of a quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call vote, to
hold such a session and only at a regular or special meeting for the sole
purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official or
licensee, unless the public employee, official or licensee requests a public
hearing. Except as otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an
executive session for the discipline of an elected official for conduct related
to the performance of his official duties or for his removal from office. If a
public body holds an executive session pursuant to this subsection, the motion
and vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved purposes listed in this subsection are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting;
      (2)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a public body shall use this subsection as a subterfuge
for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase
or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public
property has received covert information from a member of a public body that
has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers. If the minutes of
the public body show that all meetings and deliberations of the public body
have been conducted in compliance with this section, any instrument executed by
the public body purporting to convey, lease or otherwise dispose of any right,
title or interest in any public property shall be conclusively presumed to have
been executed in compliance with this section insofar as title or other
interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or transferees of the property is
concerned;
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning
disputes involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action;
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or rules or
state statutes;
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law; and
      (7)   To discuss the recruitment, establishment, retention or expansion
of any private business.
   If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the matters
listed in subsection (e)(2) to (7) hereof, the motion and vote to hold that
executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters listed
in those divisions are to be considered at the executive session.
 
   (f)   A resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid unless
adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule or formal
action adopted in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting
not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose
specifically authorized in subsection (e) hereof and conducted at an executive
session held in compliance with this section.
 
   (g)   (1)   Any person may bring an action to enforce the provisions of this
section. Upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this section in
an action brought by any person, the Court of Common Pleas shall issue an
injunction to compel the members of the public body to comply with its
provisions.
      (2)   If the Court of Common Pleas issues an injunction pursuant to this
section, the Court may award to the party that sought the injunction all court
costs and reasonable attorney's fees and also shall order the public body that
it enjoins to pay a civil forfeiture of one hundred dollars ($100.00). If the
Court of Common Pleas does not issue an injunction pursuant to this section and
the Court determines at that time that the bringing of the action was frivolous
conduct as defined in Ohio R.C. 2323.51(A), the Court may award to the public
body all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
      (3)   Irreparable harm and prejudice to the party that sought the
injunction shall be conclusively and irrebuttably presumed upon proof of a
violation or threatened violation of this section.
      (4)   A member of a public body who knowingly violates an injunction
issued pursuant to this subsection may be removed from office by an action
brought in the Court of Common Pleas for that purpose by the Director of Law.

111.02 RULES.
   These rules are promulgated pursuant to Urbana Citv Charter Section
2.08 .
Preamble
These rules of procedure have been designed to address common questions of
Council Members as well as the general public. City Council, as the legislative
body, has powers as set forth in the Urbana City Charter exclusive to
legislation and appropriation.
Section 1 - Meetings
1.1 Organizational Meetings
   
   The Council shall meet annually in compliance with Urbana City Charter
Section
2.05 . At the annual meeting, each Council member may be assigned to one or
more committees by the President.
1.2 Regular Meetings/Quorum/Open Meetings
   The Council shall meet regularly in compliance with Urbana City Charter
Section
2.07 , with a quorum of at least four members to vote. As of 2015, the Council
shall meet the first and third Tuesday of each month at the Urbana Municipal
Building at 7:00 p.m. unless the schedule is adjusted by majority vote to avoid
conflicts with holidays, etc. All meetings of Council shall be held in
accordance with the general laws of Ohio pertaining to requirements for open
meetings of public bodies, Ohio R.C. 121.22.
1.3 Special Meetings/Work Sessions
   The Council may also hold special meetings in compliance with Urbana City
Charter Section
2.07 . These meetings are often termed "work sessions" for discussion or
information-gathering purposes, but on occasion a special meeting to take
action may be held due to deadlines for required action by Council on
legislation.
   Special meetings of Council may be called upon the written request of the
Mayor, or as scheduled during a regular meeting by the Council President or
consensus of any four members of Council. The Clerk may give notice of a work
session via e-mail, and work sessions are also open meetings.
1.4 Meeting Agendas
   The Clerk of Council will deliver the agenda for every meeting at least
three days prior to each regular meeting and at least one day prior to each
special meeting. Anyone desiring to introduce legislation for Council's
consideration shall deliver it to the Clerk by 4:00 p.m. on the Tuesday prior
to a regular meeting. Proposed legislation delivered after that deadline may be
placed on the agenda for the next subsequent Council meeting unless it is of an
emergency nature as determined by the Director of Law.
   The Clerk may deliver agendas to council members (and other City employees)
as PDF (portable document format) files via e-mail, post the digital PDF to the
City website, and shall print a sufficient number of hard copies for the public
in attendance at meetings.
1.5 Record of Meetings
   The Clerk shall use any available equipment to create an audio recording of
each Council meeting except for executive sessions. The Clerk shall prepare the
minutes as a summary of Council action and discussion.
   In the absence of the Clerk, the President shall call for votes as needed,
but the President Pro Tempore shall take written notes to assist the Clerk with
preparing meeting minutes, or else prepare the minutes if the Clerk is
unavailable to do so in a timely fashion. The Clerk may also designate a
different substitute with at least 48 hours notice to both the President and
President Pro Tempore for any planned absences.
Section 2 - Order of Business for Meetings
2.1 Call to Order. Roll Call. Pledge and Minutes
   The President (or President Pro Tempore) shall promptly call the meeting to
order at the appointed time and the Clerk shall call roll of all Council
Members present, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance. As the first order of
business, the Council shall review minutes of the most recent meetings as
prepared by the Clerk and recommend any corrections or changes before approval
of those minutes by voice vote.
2.2 Proclamations and Presentations
   Generally, the President and Council may accommodate the recitation of
ceremonial resolutions and proclamations (by the Council as a body, the Council
President, and/or the Mayor), as well as short presentations, such as the
"swearing in" of new City officials and employees, prior to or immediately
after the review of minutes as the first order of business. Resolutions of
congratulations, commendations, condolences, and the like, which are not of a
general and permanent nature, may be voted and acted upon immediately after one
reading pursuant to Urbana City Charter Section
2.10 .
2.3 Communications
   All general communications to the Council as a legislative body may be
scanned to a portable document format (PDF) and sent digitally by the Clerk via
e-mail along with the meeting agenda.
   Unless any specific communication requires additional discussion, the
communications may be accepted by consent agenda with a majority voice vote.
Any Council member may make a motion to remove an item from the consent agenda
for additional discussion without the need for a second. Any item removed from
the consent agenda, after discussion, requires a separate majority voice vote
for acceptance.
2.4 Administrative Reports
   Generally, Council action on administrative reports is limited to Board of
Control purchase items. Notes to the Board of Control report that are provided
for information only do not require action by ordinance, resolution or motion.
2.5 Public Comment and Questions
   (a)    Addressing Council: Time Limits
      The President shall recognize any members of the public who have signed
in to address Council at the allotted time unless specified otherwise in the
agenda. Members of the public must use the microphone at the podium and state
name and address for the minutes. Each member of the public has a time limit of
five minutes to address Council, unless granted an extension by motion and vote
of Council members or prior scheduling with the Clerk to be included on the
agenda.
   (b)    Public Questions and Answers on Issues Raised at Meetings
      The public comment period is not a question-and-answer or debate session.
For any issues outside the scope of Council's functions in legislation and
appropriation, the Council President may refer citizens to speak with the
administration or another appropriate City department and ask for a follow-up
report from the administration.
2.6. Legislation
   Council shall consider any ordinances or resolutions submitted for first
reading, then second reading, then third reading, unless the meeting agenda
specifies otherwise.
2.7 Department Liaison Reports
   Any Council member serving as a liaison to a Department or Departments of
the City shall provide updates to Council.
2.8 Miscellaneous Business
   The Council President may ask for miscellaneous business concerns from each
Council member, and then from each department head in "round-table" fashion
after legislative matters are concluded.
2.9 Executive Session
   Executive sessions shall generally be held at the end of regular meetings
unless a meeting agenda specifies otherwise. Every motion to enter executive
session must specify the reason pursuant to Ohio R.C. 121.22(g). Prior to
entering executive session, the Council President may advise whether any
additional discussion or action is anticipated after the conclusion of the
executive session for the public's benefit.
Section 3 - Legislative Procedure
3.1 Forms of Action by Council
   All actions of Council shall be by ordinance, resolution or motion. Motions
with majority voice vote shall be used to conduct the routine business of
Council, in procedural matters, for elections conducted among and appointments
made by Council members, to make requests of city officials, and as otherwise
provided in the City Charter. All other action shall be taken by ordinance or
resolution, with a roll call vote by the Clerk.
3.2 Deliberation/Discussion/Debate
   All Council members shall be given the opportunity to speak to any motion,
legislation, or question should he/she so desire. No Council member shall speak
longer than 15 minutes on the same motion, legislation or question without the
permission of the Council President.
   Personal remarks during deliberations or debate are always out of order and
shall be ruled as such by the Council President. Discussion must be directed to
the motion on the floor, not motives and/or personalities. Council members
shall confine their comments and questions to the issues and principles of
proposed legislation.
3.3 Motion to Table
   No motion to "table" may be made until all Council members have had an
opportunity to speak at least once during discussion. A motion to "table" shall
be treated as a motion to temporarily postpone discussion until the next
regular meeting, and may not be used to permanently suspend deliberations on a
proposed ordinance or resolution.
   A motion to table shall require a two-thirds majority to take effect and
shall not be made after a motion to discuss and adopt any emergency
legislation. If tabled, the same Council member who moved to table shall, at
the next regular meeting, move to return the legislation to the business floor
for discussion. Amendments to tabled legislation may be made pursuant to Rule
5.2.
3.4 Motion to Withdraw
   After discussion, any Council member making a motion may request to withdraw
the motion if no other Council member has seconded the motion, or if the
Council member who seconded the motion likewise requests to withdraw the
second, prior to a vote. The Council President shall decide motions to
withdraw.
3.5 Motion to Reconsider or Rescind.
   No Council member shall make a motion to reconsider or rescind during the
same regular meeting after a vote has been taken. Motions to "rescind" and
"reconsider" are restorative motions, and may be used to permit Council to
change or re-evaluate legislation that has been approved or voted down.
   Motions to rescind shall include the original number of the ordinance or
resolution, as the vote shall pertain to the original proposal as submitted to
council.
   Motions to reconsider shall require a new ordinance or resolution number for
any changes to proposed legislation that was not passed or vetoed by the Mayor
without a council override.
3.6 Votes
   All Council members in attendance shall vote "yes," "no," or "abstain" in
response to a roll call vote; in response to a majority voice vote, shall vote
"yes," "no" or remain silent.
   A Council member may not delay voting or "pass" when called upon to cast a
vote.
3.7 Point of Order
   Any Council member may bring a Point of Order to the attention of the
Council President.
   The Council President may ask the Clerk of Council or Director of Law for
clarification of procedural questions at any time. In the event that state law,
the City Charter or these rules do not address a particular procedural matter,
the President, Council Clerk, and/or Director of Law shall consult a recognized
parliamentary procedure guide such as Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure,
The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure, or Robert's Rules of Order. Any
Council member may appeal from a point of order decided by the Council
President by a motion requiring a second and approval by three-quarters
majority vote of Council members present.
Section 4 - Enacting Legislation
4.1 Introduction of Ordinances and Resolutions
   Any member of Council or the City administration (division and department
heads) may introduce an ordinance or resolution, at a regular or special
meeting, which shall contain a concise title and one subject only with two
exceptions to this rule:
   (A)    Appropriation ordinances, which may contain the various subjects,
accounts and amounts for which monies are appropriated; and
   (B)    Compilations of updates to the Codified Ordinances.
   All proposed legislation must be received by the Clerk of Council by 4:00
p.m. on the Tuesday preceding the meeting at which it is to be introduced for a
first reading. The Clerk of Council shall distribute copies of proposed
ordinances and resolutions to each Council Member along with the agenda.
Legislation received after the deadline may be deferred for consideration until
the next regularly-scheduled Council meeting unless authorized by the Council
President or deemed to be an emergency and authorized by the Director of Law.
4.2 Amendments
   A pending ordinance or resolution may be amended at any time after first
reading, prior to its passage by the Council, by a majority vote of the members
of the Council present and voting on the amendment. Such amendment shall not
require additional readings of the ordinance or resolution unless the Director
of Law is absent from a meeting and unable to review the proposed amendment for
conformity to state and federal law.
4.3. Voting
   All Council Members present shall vote upon the Council President's call for
a vote by responding YES or NO, except if the Council Member perceives a
potential conflict of interest, at which time it is permissible to abstain from
voting by responding "ABSTAIN" upon the call. No further elaboration need be
given for abstention other than "conflict of interest," but the Council Member,
in the interest of transparency, may provide a brief explanation for the
minutes. Any Council Member, not being excused, who refuses to vote or abstain,
may be found in contempt of Council and may be censured by a majority vote of
Council.
4.4 Definition of Majority
   For as long as Council consists of seven (7) members, a simple majority
requires the vote of four (4) members, a two-thirds majority requires five (5)
members, and a three-fourths majority requires six (6) members.
Section 5 - General
5.1 Access to Information
   The Clerk shall regularly update and post minutes to the Council-specific
pages of the City of Urbana's website, www.urbanaohio.com. The Clerk serves as
Council's designated public records custodian.
   With the exception of the Council Clerk, Council lacks authority to give
orders to any City employee, and shall inquire directly with the Mayor or
Director of Administration as to administrative affairs of the City (see Urbana
City Charter Section
2.20). For inquiries relating to proposed legislation, however, Council members
may request explanation by a department representative, if one is present at a
Council meeting or work session.
5.2 Notifications/Notice
   Any notice or notification to be given by the Clerk may be given by any
person designated to act on behalf of or under the authority of the Clerk. The
Clerk shall maintain a record of the date and manner, and time, if pertinent
under these Rules, of all actions taken with regard to notices and
notifications under these Rules, and shall retain copies of proofs of
publication of any notifications or notices.
5.3 Conduct of Council Members
   The professional and personal conduct of Council members must be above
reproach and avoid the appearance of impropriety. Council members shall refrain
from abusive conduct or personal attacks upon the character or motives of other
Council members as well as City staff and the general public. Council members
shall prepare for meetings by reviewing agendas, minutes and other information
provided, refrain from interrupting other speakers, practice civility and
decorum in discussion, and avoid arguments with members of the general public
during Council meetings.
5.4 Ethics
   Council Members shall act with honesty and uphold the highest ethical
standards so that public confidence and trust in the integrity, objectivity,
and impartiality of government are conserved and enhanced. Each member of
Council, and the Clerk of Council, shall become familiar and comply with the
most current version of the Ohio Ethics Law (Revised Code Chapter 102) and
related statutes such as Ohio R.C. Chapter 2921. Any Council member who
believes that he or she may have a conflict of interest with a pending issue
should seek the advice of the Director of Law or the Ohio Ethics Commission,
prior to entering into any discussion or voting on that issue.

(1984 Code Sec. 35.27)
149.09 GRADING.
   (a)   All examinations shall be graded by the examiners, and the results

maximum score or minimum passing score is established by the testing service.
In order to be placed on the eligibility list, an applicant shall attain the
minimum passing score in the final general average of all of his or her test
scores. However, the Director, with the approval of the Commission, may require
a minimum passing score in some specific part of an examination as published in
the announcement, and the failure of the candidate to make such requirement in
that part of the examination shall disqualify the applicant in the entire
examination.
   (b)   The weights of the various parts of each examination shall be
determined by the Director and filed with the Commission prior to the
examination, and shall be applied uniformly in determining each applicant's
final grade.
   (c)   An applicant who has served on active duty in the armed forces of the
United States for a continuous period of two years or more and has been
honorably discharged shall receive five points credit in addition to the test
score. When a candidate has been honorably discharged with more than one year
but less than two years of service, points shall be prorated on a daily
proration starting with zero points for one year (365 days) and five points for
two years (730 days).
   Participation in the National Guard, ROTC or any inactive military service
shall not be eligible for the military service credit. Military service credit
points shall not be added until a passing score is attained. Military service
credit points shall not apply to any promotional examination.

same classification unless background requirements are modified. (Ord. 4103-20.

      (4)   A person certified from an eligible list more than three times from
the same classification, who is not appointed, may be omitted from future

(Ord. 4089. Passed 6-8-99.)
   (c)   Placement of Lay-Offs on the Eligible List. When any regular appointee
is laid off, the name of such person shall be placed at the top of the eligible
list for the classification from which the employee is laid off. If there is no
existing eligible list at the time, the name of such person shall constitute
one. When two or more persons have been laid off, whether at the same time or
not, their names shall be placed at the to be of such eligible list in the
order of their appointment in the classification held by them when laid off.
Such persons shall be eligible for certification and reappointment for a period
of one year thereafter.
   (d)   Notice of Certification. When the name of an eligible is certified to

objection is made may be granted a hearing by the Commission, at which time the
Director may present the objection. If the objection is sustained by the
Commission, the next highest name on the eligible list shall be certified.
(1984 Code Sec. 35.33)

unqualified or unsuitable for the position, the Director shall notify the
Commission of such rejection and the reasons therefor.
      (4)   If an additional name is to be certified to replace the person
rejected, the Commission shall approve the reasons for such rejection. The

149.16 PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   (a)   Purpose. The probationary period shall be regarded as an integral part

the appointee has satisfactorily served the probationary period.
   (c)   Probation Reports.

probationary period shall be extended the length of such absence. On return to
duty following such absence, such employee shall be required to serve the
unexpired portion of the probationary period.
(1984 Code Sec. 35.35)
149.17 PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   Promotional Examinations in Police and Fire Divisions. Promotion to
positions above the rank of fireman in the Fire Division and patrolman in the
Police Division shall be by successive ranks as far as is practicable.
Promotions within the Fire Division and Police Division shall be by competitive
examination. For the purposes of this section, two or more persons who are
eligible are required to take the promotional examination for the examination
to be deemed competitive. When there are not two eligible persons to take the
examination in the next rank lower than the position sought, the examination
shall be opened to successive lower ranks until there are two or more eligible
persons to take the examination, except that no person shall be eligible to
take a promotional examination, other than the Chief, in either the Police
Division or the Fire Division, unless he has three years' service in his
department. For the position of Chief of the Fire Division and Chief of the
Police Division the Mayor may nominate two additional qualified persons to take
the promotional examination in addition to those members of his respective
divisions who are otherwise eligible. Except for the position of Chief in the
Fire Division and Chief in the Police Division, no promotional position in

or training of value to public service, for maternity leave or for any other

absence from their respective duties for such time as they are in the military
service, on field training or active duty for periods not to exceed thirty-one
days in any one calendar year.
   (c)   Failure to Return From Leave of Absence. Failure to return to work on

   (d)   Resignation.
      (1)   Any employee in the classified service who desires to resign in
good standing shall give written notice to the employee's division head at
least two weeks prior to the date the employee intends to leave, unless the
division head consents to a shorter period. When the division head approves
such request, it shall be forwarded to the Director, who shall in turn notify
the Commission.
      (2)   If an employee has been served with a dismissal notice and such
notice has been filed with the Commission, and the employee thereupon resigns,
the acceptance of the resignation by the Chief or Director, as appropriate,
constitutes resignation. If disciplinary charges are pending, they shall be
deemed to be withdrawn and the proceedings shall be dismissed without judgment.
The resignation shall be effective immediately and the employee may not be
reinstated, unless the charges on which the disciplinary proceedings were based
later prove to be without factual basis or basis in law. In such event, the
Director may reinstate the employee, with the approval of the Commission.
   (e)   Absence Without Leave.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section "workday" means the days the
employee is regularly scheduled to work. This section does not preclude
disciplinary or dismissal action for a shorter period of absence of sufficient
seriousness.
      (2)   Absence from duty without authorized leave for three consecutive
workdays shall constitute resignation in bad standing. However, if within three
days of the effective date of such resignation the employee submits sufficient
evidence explaining that the employee was physically or mentally unable to
notify the chief of his division of the reason for his absence, the Director
may authorize the nullification of the resignation.
   (f)   Reinstatement. Any classified employee in the Police or Fire Division
who has resigned in good standing may be reinstated to employment, within one
year of the effective date of the resignation, with the written approval of the
Director. Any person reinstated under the authority of this division shall not
receive credit for service prior to resignation in determining seniority or
longevity and may only be reinstated to the entry level position. The decision
of the Director shall not be subject to appeal.
   (g)   Other Leave. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the establishment
of vacation, sick leave, holidays, compensatory time or similar leave
practices.
(1984 Code Sec. 35.37)
149.19 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.

(1984 Code Sec. 35.38)
149.20 LAYOFFS AND REEMPLOYMENT.
   (a)   Reduction in Personnel. Whenever it becomes necessary to reduce the
number of employees in the classified service, the Director shall have the

by such layoffs. The Director shall notify the Commission and furnish the names
of the employees laid off in the order in which such layoffs occurred.
   (b)   Order of Layoffs.
      (1)   Whenever it becomes necessary to reduce the working force in a
classification in any division of the City, the Director shall lay off
employees inversely in the order of seniority. No layoffs shall be affected or
influenced by politics, religion, sex or race, and layoff shall not be used as
a substitute for disciplinary action.
      (2)   In the event two or more employees of the same status in the same
classification are subject to layoff and have the same seniority status, the
order of layoff shall be according to their final grades on the examination
passed to obtain such classification. The employee with the lowest grade shall
be laid off first.
      (3)   Any permanent employee who has been promoted and is subject to
layoff shall be entitled to return to the position from which the employee was
promoted. If such former position has been filled, the employee in the position
shall be demoted into the lower position occupied prior to the promotion. This
process shall continue until the most recently hired employee affected by such
demotions is laid off.
   (c)   Seniority Credit. Seniority credit shall be the amount of continuous
service an employee has accumulated in the service of the City, according to
the following rules:
      (1)   Any permanent employee who has served as a temporary or
probationary employee and who has achieved permanent status with no
interruption in service shall receive seniority credit for the continuous
service during the period served as a temporary or probationary employee.
      (2)   Part-time employees shall have their continuous service prorated as
it relates to full-time service when determining seniority credit for layoff
purposes.
      (3)   Any leave without pay shall be subtracted when computing the
continuous service of an employee for purpose of determining seniority credit.
      (4)   The continuous service of a permanent employee who has resigned and
has been reinstated shall be computed from the time of the last reinstatement
and no seniority credit shall accrue for service prior thereto.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, rank shall in
all cases supersede length of service when determining seniority, with higher
rank being senior to lower rank.
   (d)   Reemployment List.
      (1)   When any permanent classified employee is laid off, the name of
such person shall be placed at the top of the eligible list of classification
from which the employee was laid off. If there is no existing eligible list at
the time, the employee's name shall constitute one. When two or more persons
have been laid off, whether at the same time or not, their names shall be
placed at the top of such eligible list in the order of their appointment in
the classification held by them when laid off.
      (2)   Such person shall be eligible for certification and reemployment
for a period of one year thereafter, or, if sooner, until such time as the
employee is removed from the eligible list for the reasons provided in Section
149.13.

155.01 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   "Under the influence" means any mental, emotional, sensory or physical
impairment due to the use of drugs or alcohol.
   (b)   "Illegal drug" means any drug that is not legally obtainable; that is
being used in a manner or for a purpose other than prescribed.
   (c)   "Control substance" has the same meaning as defined in Ohio R. C.
3719.01 (D).
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.02  PURPOSE.
   Employees are the City's most valuable resource and their health and safety
are of paramount concern. Therefore, the purpose of this policy is to provide
employees a safe work environment unaffected by the abuse of alcohol and the
illegal use of drugs to provide them with guidelines that the City will apply
for the handling of alcohol and drug situations.
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.03 USE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.
    (a)    Employees shall not possess, sell or use illegal drugs or controlled
substances, nor abuse prescribed drugs, while on the job or on City property.
   (b)    Employees shall not report to work under the influence of illegal
drugs or other than prescribed drugs which shall be reported to their
supervisors.
   (c)    Employees shall not report to work under the influence of alcohol or
possess or consume alcohol while on the job.
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.04 DRUG CHARGES AND CONVICTIONS.
   (a)    Any employee charged with the violation of a criminal drug offense
shall notify the Director of Administration immediately.
   (b)    Employees convicted of criminal drug offenses shall be subject to
disciplinary action up to discharge.
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.05 DRUG SCREENS.
   (a)    Pre-employment. A pre-employment drug screen is required of all
potential employees. The City does not hire applicants who test positive
because being under the influence of drugs is likely to affect job performance.
   (b)    Reasonable Suspicion. When there is a reasonable suspicion that an
employee is using or possessing illegal drugs or is abusing a controlled
substance at work or is working or reporting to work under the influence of
illegal drugs, or an abused controlled substance, that employee will be
required to consent to a drug test immediately. Reasonable suspicion may be
based upon, but is not limited to, appearance of being under the influence of
drugs during work, the odor of alcohol or marijuana on an employee, unusual
behavior such as slurred speech or lack of coordination, possession of
paraphernalia used in connection with any drug or substance subject to these
rules, or involvement in any incidents (i.e. fighting) on duty.
   (c)    Post Accident/Incident. The City shall require testing of any
employee involved in an accident which results in significant injury requiring
medical attention or significant property damage while at work, on City
property or on City business.
   Testing will require that the employee provide a urine and/or blood sample,
or some other medically accepted procedure. The employee to be tested may have
a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician or chemist of their
own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any
administered under this chapter.
   All drug screen samples will be given at a licensed medical facility or
doctor's office chosen by the City, sealed, and properly identified. Testing
will be conducted by a certified laboratory, and test results will be treated
confidentially in the manner necessary to protect a legitimate interest of the
City.
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.06 REHABILITATION AND COUNSELING.
   (a)    Any positive test results shall result in the employee being subject
to discharge if he or she fails to comply with subsections (b) and (c) hereof.
   (b)   In the case of a positive test result, the employee shall seek
professional help for a drug related problem. If the treatment requires that
the employee not work for a specific period of time, the employee will be
considered on sick leave. This leave may be conditional upon receipt of reports
that the employee is cooperating and making reasonable progress in the
treatment program. In addition, this leave is conditioned upon the employee
entering an appropriate treatment program as soon as possible. The employee
will authorize the SAP office to provide the City of Urbana updates and
progress reports while in a rehabilitation program.
   (c)    Treatment programs acceptable to the City under this policy are those
provided by facilities which are accredited by the Joint Commission on the
Accreditation of Hospitals and/or licensed through an appropriate state
licensing agency.
   (d)    Any employee who has returned to work after participating in a
treatment program and fails a re-test thereafter, shall be discharged.
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.07 DRUG DEPENDENCY TREATMENT.
   (a)    Employees are urged to request assistance with any drug problem
before disciplinary action is necessary. If an employee advises the City of a
drug problem, the employee will be urged to receive counseling and, if
necessary, will be permitted to take a leave of absence to receive the
recommended treatment. However, a drug related problem will not excuse any
violation of City rules.
   (b)    Chemical dependencies are treatable. Employees covered by City
sponsored health insurance have limited coverage for treatment of chemical
dependency. Any costs associated with treatment that are not covered by
insurance will be the responsibility of the employee.
(Ord. 4033. Passed 5-13-97.)
155.08 DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
   In addition to other disciplinary actions provided for herein:
    (a)    Any employee who violates Section
155.03 shall be subject to disciplinary action up to discharge;
    (b)    Any employee who violates Section
155.04 (a) shall be subject to disciplinary action but not discharge;
    (c)    Any employee who is convicted of a violation of a criminal drug
offense as stated in Section
155.04 (b) shall be subject to disciplinary action up to discharge; and
    (d)    Any employee who fails to seek or successfully complete the
rehabilitation and counseling provided for in Section
155.06 shall be discharged.

Individuals.
   (A)    For residents of City of Urbana, the income tax levied herein shall
be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident. This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
171.02(C)(16)).

commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by

tax that was paid on the nondistributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified

Urbana for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.

      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business

         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

171.12(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:

            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment.
         The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section

Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of City of Urbana. The payment of tax
by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and City of Urbana as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City of Urbana income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to City of Urbana the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
of Urbana income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for City of Urbana until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for City of Urbana during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City of Urbana
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.

         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in City of
Urbana only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in City of Urbana than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in City of Urbana exceeds the twenty (20)-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to City of Urbana for any subsequent days
in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in City of Urbana.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for City of
Urbana under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
City of Urbana for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in City of
Urbana.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is City of Urbana and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
171.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to City

the corporate boundaries of City of Urbana.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section

income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption

The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from

municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing

manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by City of Urbana to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of

each individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall

which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the City of Urbana's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of City of Urbana's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's City of Urbana income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City of Urbana
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of City
of Urbana's income tax return. The extended due date of City of Urbana's income
tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by City of Urbana, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this

amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to City of Urbana for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with City
of Urbana an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section,
unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to City of Urbana income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with City of
Urbana for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
171.04(C)(1)(g)) within City of Urbana.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in City of Urbana
and does not expect to be subject to City of Urbana income tax for the taxable
year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within City of Urbana. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within City of Urbana, make any sales in City of Urbana, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by City of Urbana during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by City of Urbana for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with City of Urbana income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City of Urbana by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
171.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by City of Urbana, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to City of Urbana and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by City of Urbana to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by City of Urbana, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by City of Urbana or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of City of Urbana's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian

support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of City of
Urbana for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax

otherwise due to the City of Urbana before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by City of Urbana in accordance

of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of

(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to City of
Urbana's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five (5)-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five (5)-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the ORC, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or (2) of
this section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the
five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the ORC is
terminated, valid election made under section 718.86 of the ORC is binding upon
the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five (5)-year period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Urbana income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to City of Urbana. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated City of Urbana income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Urbana income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City of Urbana income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
171.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City of Urbana income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
171.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Urbana income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Urbana. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Urbana. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the passthrough entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Urbana;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City of Urbana
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City of Urbana income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
171.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City of Urbana income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by City of Urbana in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with City of Urbana before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with City of Urbana may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not

grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other

qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.

"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least

hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
City of Urbana under Section
171.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in City of Urbana but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
171.21.

of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
171.18(A)(4).

as a refund but is subject to the three (3)-year limitation on refunds.

equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to
such income or wages.
   (C)    If City of Urbana's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using City of
Urbana's tax rate. However, if-City of Urbana's tax rate is greater than the
tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to City of Urbana, along with any penalty and interest
that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with City
of Urbana. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal

   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
171.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of

that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by City of Urbana. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
171.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to

computations, and attachments.

or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Urbana's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Urbana return showing
income subject to City of Urbana income tax based upon such final determination
of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City
of Urbana income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board

appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided

171.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section

taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 4600-23. Passed 12-19-23.)
171.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Urbana official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days
after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of
Urbana official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 4600-23. Passed 12-19-23.)
171.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to City of Urbana that arises pursuant to City of Urbana's income tax imposed
in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of City of
Urbana:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 4600-23. Passed 12-19-23.)
171.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of City of Urbana as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit City of Urbana from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 4600-23. Passed 12-19-23.)
171.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City of Urbana ordinance or state
law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud City of Urbana or the Tax
Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to

171.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.

   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

for the income tax levied by City of Urbana or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the

shall fail to comply.

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section

171.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the legislative authority of City of

or losses of the S corporation.
      (13)   Salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and net

subdivisions to impose net income taxes on income derived from interstate
commerce.

         (Ord. 4173. Passed 12-9-03.)
 
173.031 ADDITIONAL TAX.
   (a)   In addition to the annual tax imposed by Section
 173.03, an additional annual tax of four-tenths of one-percent (0.4%) is also
imposed.
 
   (b)   The additional tax shall be used solely for public safety operating
and capital improvement purposes.
 
   (c)   The additional tax imposed by this section is imposed on the same
basis as the annual tax imposed by Section
173.03 and shall be levied, collected and administered under the provisions of
this chapter.
 
   (d)   The additional tax shall take effect on January 1, 1992.
(Ord. 4173. Passed 12-9-03.)
 
173.04 ANNUAL RETURN AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   Every person upon whom a tax is imposed by Section
173.03, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon,
make and file an annual return on or before April 15 of the year following the
effective date of this chapter and on or before April 15 of each year
thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed within four months from the
end of that fiscal year or period.
 
   (b)   The annual return shall also show the amount of tax imposed by this
chapter on such earnings and profits. The taxpayer making this annual return
shall at the time of the filing thereof pay to the Income Tax Supervisor the
amount of taxes shown as due thereon. However, where any portion of the tax so
due is deducted at the source and is paid to the Income Tax Supervisor by the
person making the deduction pursuant to the provisions of Section
173.06 credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to
be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the annual return. Further, where any tax payments are made to another
municipality granting reciprocity similar to the provisions of Section
173.13, credit for the amount so paid and to the extent refundable under the
reciprocity may also be deducted from the amount of tax shown to be due on the
annual return, and only the balance of tax, if any, shall be due and payable at
the time of filing the annual return. If the amount of the credit for
refundable tax payments made to a municipality having a similar reciprocity is
equal to or in excess of the balance of tax shown to be due on the annual
return, no payment need be made at the time of filing the annual return.
 
   (c)   The claiming of credit for amounts so paid to any other municipality
shall constitute an assignment and transfer to the City of all right, title and
interest of the taxpayer claiming the credit in and to any claim for refund of
the amounts so paid to the other municipality. In the event of a refund not
received by the City in an amount equal to the credit claimed by reason of tax
payments made to another municipality and subject to reciprocity, then the
taxpayer shall be liable to the City for and as taxes due from the date of the
filing of the annual return upon which the credit was claimed of the amounts by
which the claimed credit exceeds the amount of refund received by this City.
 
   (d)   The Income Tax Supervisor may extend the time for filing of the annual
return upon the request of the taxpayer for a period not to exceed six months,
or one month beyond any extension requested or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the federal income tax return. The Income Tax
Supervisor may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount
of tax shown to be due thereon, by the date the return is normally due. No
penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the
final tax paid within the period as extended.
 
   (e)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Income Tax Supervisor the amount of taxes shown as due thereon.
However, where any portion of the tax so due is deducted at the source pursuant
to the provisions of Section
 173.05 any portion of the tax is paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the
provisions of Section
 173.06 or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
173.13, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
 
   (f)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which this
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, the overpayment (or part thereof) shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar
($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
 
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   An amended return shall be filed in order to report additional
income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid,
subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Section
173.10. Amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Income Tax Supervisor. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within ninety days from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to this Municipality, the
taxpayer shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to the
income tax of this Municipality based upon the final determination of federal
tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund for any overpayment.
 
   (h)   A penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be assessed by the
Income Tax Supervisor for the failure of a taxpayer to file a return as
required by the provisions of this section for which no extension has been
granted or where an extension has been granted within the time period of the
extension.

173.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within, or doing business within, the City, who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis,
shall deduct at the time of the payment of the salary, wage, commission or
other compensation, the tax levied under this chapter of the gross salaries,
wages, commissions or other compensation due by the employer to employee. The
employer shall make the return and pay the amounts deducted on or before the
15th day of the month following the close of each calendar month. The return
shall be on a form or forms prescribed by and obtainable from the Income Tax
Supervisor, and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Income Tax Supervisor. Certain employers may be authorized to
make quarterly rather than monthly returns as provided in this section.
Authorization for quarterly returns shall be at the discretion of the Income
Tax Supervisor in accordance with regulations adopted by the Supervisor
pursuant to Section
173.07(b). Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
 
   (b)   An employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by the employer to this Municipality, as a trustee for
the benefit of this Municipality. Any tax collected by an employer from his
employees, shall, until the same is paid to this Municipality, be deemed a
trust fund in the hands of the employer.
 
   (c)   On or before February 28th following any calendar year, the employer
shall file with the Income Tax Supervisor an information return for each
employee from whom City income tax has been, or should have been withheld,

amount of compensation paid during the year, and the amount of City income tax
withheld from the employee.
 
   (d)   The Income Tax Supervisor, for good cause, may require immediate
returns and payments to be submitted to his office.
 
   (e)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about the
person's residence. Domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
 
   (f)   By December 1, 1992, and by November 1 of each and every year
thereafter, all landlords who rent real property in the City shall submit an
up-to-date list of all their tenants to the City Income Tax Supervisor. Any
person who violates this section shall be subject to a fine of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) per day for each and every day they remain in violation and
will be subject to all other methods of collection procedures.
(Ord. 4173. Passed 12-9-03.)
 
173.06 DECLARATIONS OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
 173.05 hereof, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or
activity subject to the tax imposed by Section
173.03 hereof, shall file a declaration setting forth the estimated income or
the estimated profit or loss from the business activity, together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. However, if a person's income is wholly from
wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted to this Municipality in
accordance with Section
173.05, the person need not file a declaration.
 
   (b)   This declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each year
during the effective period of this chapter, or within four months of the date
the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time. Those taxpayers
reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration within four months
after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
 
   (c)   This declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable
from the Income Tax Supervisor, provided, however, credit shall be taken for
this Municipality's income tax to be withheld from any portion of such income.
In accordance with the provisions of Section
173.13, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality. The original declaration (or any
subsequent amendment thereof) may be increased or decreased on or before any
subsequent quarterly payment date as provided for herein.
 
   (d)   The declaration of estimated tax to be paid this Municipality shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax and
at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the 15th day of the sixth,
ninth and twelfth months after the beginning of the taxable year. However, in
case an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
 
   (e)   The taxpayer shall base his estimated tax on the preceding year's tax
liability or by annualizing if the preceding tax period was not for a full
twelve-month period. In that case, if each installment is paid on that basis,
no interest or penalty shall apply for underestimate, regardless of the final
tax liability, except in the case where the required return and final return
payment have not been submitted within the four-month period after the close of
the tax year.
 
   (f)   An annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due this
Municipality shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of
Section
173.04.

additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within three months after final
determination of the federal tax liability.
 
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Income Tax Supervisor, the Board of Review
may abate penalty or interest, or both. Upon an appeal from the refusal of the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and

title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.

housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.

violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

speed limits, and signs or marks on the pavements indicating the restrictions
and regulations as to parking of vehicles, provided for by the provisions of
this Traffic Code and other ordinances of the City and other signs or marks as

and parking limitations.
(1984 Code Sec. 70.20)
305.02 SPECIFIC POWERS ENUMERATED.
   In order to avoid hazards incident to public travel and to protect the

Director of Administration is authorized and directed to establish and mark
traffic-control areas as provided in the following subsections:
   (a)   Traffic-Control Signals. The Director shall establish and designate
traffic-control intersections, at which intersections shall be maintained the
traffic-control signals to regulate traffic. The Director shall have all
necessary authority to install at the locations any lawful traffic-control
signal when in his discretion it is necessary to expedite travel and promote
public safety.
   (b)   One-Way Traffic. The Director shall determine and designate streets,
parts of streets or specific lanes thereon upon which vehicular traffic shall
proceed in one direction only and shall place and maintain appropriate
markings, signs, barriers or other devices to give notice thereof. The Director
may erect signs temporarily designating lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center line of the roadway.
   (c)   Stop and Yield Right-of-Way Intersections. The Director shall
establish and designate stop intersections and yield right-of-way
intersections, at which intersections shall be maintained the appropriate
traffic-control devices to regulate traffic and promote public safety. The
Director shall have all necessary authority to erect or cause to be erected
appropriate and legible signs or markers, upon which shall be displayed the
word "stop" at all intersections designated by the Director as stop
intersections or the words "yield right of way" at all intersections designated
by the Director as yield right-of-way intersections.
   (d)   Turns at Intersections. The Director shall place markers, buttons or
signs within or adjacent to intersections indicating the course to be traveled
by vehicles turning at the intersections or preventing turns at the
intersections.
   (e)   Through Routes. The Director shall designate certain routes which
shall be designated as through routes and shall be adequately signed, when the
designated routes contribute to accelerate the flow of travel and promote
public safety.
   (f)   Through Trucks. The Director shall designate and appropriately mark
certain streets over which no person shall drive any through truck. The
designation shall be made only upon the basis of traffic survey determining
that the street is not of adequate width, structure or design so as to
accommodate the vehicle with safety.
   (g)   Pedestrian Crosswalks. The Director shall establish and designate by
appropriate devices, marks or lines upon the surface of the roadway, crosswalks
at intersections where in his opinion there is particular danger to pedestrians
crossing the roadway, and at other places as he may deem necessary in the
interests of public safety.

the kind and character and at such places as he may deem necessary for the
protection of pedestrians.

unloaded in the operation of bus and taxi service for the protection of
passengers and pedestrians.
   (j)   Business Loading Zones. The Director shall establish zones for loading
and unloading of passengers or merchandise, or both, when in his judgment the
operations of business in the area justify and traffic conditions permit and he
shall specify appropriate time limits for the zones.
   (k)   No Parking Zones. To promote safety on the street, to expedite the
flow of traffic and to regulate parking on the streets, the Director may
designate areas as "no parking zones" or "limited parking zones" and prescribe
time limitations for parking or prohibit parking upon the streets, alleys and
highways of the City. An appropriate sign or other device shall mark the
boundaries of the zones.

individual parking spaces in certain sections of the downtown area and outlying
districts, the parking spaces to be established along the curb of streets in
the sections and to be approximately twenty-three feet in length alongside
curbs.
   (m)   Traffic Lanes; Overtaking and Passing Zones. The Director shall:
      (1)   Mark lanes for traffic on street pavements at places as he may deem
advisable in the interest of public safety; and
      (2)   Determine those portions of any street where overtaking and passing
other traffic or driving to the left of center, or off-set center, or center
line of the street or roadway would be especially hazardous, and may by
appropriate signs or markings on the street or roadway, indicate the beginning
and end of the zones. The zones shall be designated in the following manner,
to-wit: An auxiliary yellow line placed parallel and to the right of the normal
centerline or off-set center line.
   (n)   Notice to Council. Whenever a traffic-control change shall affect more
than 500 lineal feet of street, two or more intersections or involve the
signalization or disignalization of an intersection, the Director shall notify
Council not less than two weeks prior to making such change. Whenever lesser
changes are to be made the Director shall advise Council of such change in
advance. For purposes of this section signalization or disignalization shall
refer to the alteration of an intersection to the control or removal from the
control of a traffic signal. Nothing contained herein shall limit temporary or
emergency changes nor the improvement in signs, markings or signals by
installing additional, larger or otherwise improved devices. Further, it shall
not limit the authority of the Director to install crosswalks or to make minor
adjustments in the locations of traffic lane markings.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample isobtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima-facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of

offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.

preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a

vehicle occupied the motor vehicle together at the time of the offense.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of wrongful entrustment of a
motor vehicle and shall be punished as provided in subsections (c) to (h) of
this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, whoever

      (2)   A.   If, within three years of a violation of subsection (a)(1),
(2) or (3) of this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or

driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02, and, if the vehicle involved
in the offense is registered in the name of the offender, the court may order
one of the following:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(3)B. or C. of this
section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having
jurisdiction of the offense that lead to the order terminates the forfeiture

necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

nonresident operating privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender
under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

   (i)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency. (ORC 4510.04)

subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,

unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and
professionally licensed persons and that would apply under the appropriate
provisions of those divisions to a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing, or possession
offense that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy
shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to the
conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty to the felony
drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense that is the
most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
   B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that subsection,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;

specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.

the fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine

and rubbish so removed from the gutter shall be piled in convenient heaps by
the owner and removed by the City Engineer.
(1984 Code Sec. 91.04)
901.02 NOTICE TO CLEAN; CLEANING WHEN RECIPIENT OF NOTICE FAILS TO ACT.
   The Director of Administration shall give written notice to the owner of
lots, parts of lots or parcels of land abutting on any gutter that shall need
cleaning, as required in Section

from the service of the notice, the Director shall cause the same to be cleaned
at a reasonable cost, which cost, if not paid within fifteen days after the
cleaning of the gutters, shall be certified to the County Auditor for
collection as taxes are collected.

901.03 REMOVAL OF ICE OR SNOW FROM SIDEWALKS AND PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   No owner or occupant of any premises within the limits of the City
shall permit or allow snow or ice to remain on any sidewalk or parking area for
more than 24 hours after receiving written notice from the Director of
Administration or the Street Department to remove the snow or ice if it creates
a specific public hazard as documented in the written notice. If snow or ice is
not removed, the Director of Administration or Street Superintendent may
proceed with removal at the expense of the owner or occupant of the premises,
either with City personnel or by contracted services. If such cost is not paid
within 15 days of invoice by the City, the Director of Finance shall certify
the amount owed to the County Auditor in the same manner as a special
assessment for unpaid utilities.
   (b)   No business or property owner may remove snow or ice in a manner that
obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic on a sidewalk or street. All ice or
snow cleared from a private property shall be disposed of on private property
in a manner that does not create dangerous conditions for the public.
      (1)   Any plow operator who violates this section by plowing snow and ice
into the street, if observed by a City employee or other competent witness who
documents such action with photographic or video evidence, may be charged with
a violation of Section
311.01 (D) by the Municipal Prosecutor or any law enforcement officer.
      (2)   The City may assess a civil penalty of $100 to a real property
owner or business occupant for a violation that does not involve an eyewitness
observation of the act of plowing/dumping snow into the street or obstructing a
sidewalk. Any City employee who identifies excessive accumulation of snow or
ice on a street or sidewalk abutting a specific parcel shall document that
location to the Street Superintendent. Upon affidavit by the Street
Superintendent which specifies the basis for the allegation of violation, the
Director of Finance shall send notice of liability for a civil penalty by
ordinary mail to the property owner of record listed by the County Auditor, or
the business occupant, within five days of the violation date. If such penalty
is not paid within 30 days of the date of mailing a notice of liability, the
Director of Finance shall add an additional late fee of $50 and assess the
property in the same manner as unpaid utilities. A property owner may appeal
imposition of a civil penalty and/or late fee to the Champaign County Municipal
Court Civil Division within 15 days of the mailing of a notice of liability. An
individual desiring an appeal must first post payment equal to the amount of
the civil penalty and pay any applicable filing fee imposed by the court.
Failure to appeal or pay the penalty within 45 days of the mailing of notice of
liability shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the notice of
liability. All penalties collected in this manner shall be deposited into the
street fund.

Engineer. The owner or developer who constructs a sidewalk is responsible for
curb ramps at intersections. Owners or developers shall be required to install
sidewalks on individual properties prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. If the sidewalks are not installed, the City will perform the
installation and assess the owner for all costs incurred plus ten percent (10%)
according to the provisions of Section 913.20.

also reserves the right to grant variances from any such special design
specifications. As used herein, “variance” shall have the same meaning as set
forth in Section

affected party filed with the Clerk of Council. Such applications shall be in
the form prescribed by Council and Council shall grant or deny applications
within thirty days from the date of filing. Failure of Council to grant or deny
such applications within the time specified shall be considered a denial of
such applications. The City Engineer shall maintain records of the applications
filed and the disposition made of each, all of which shall be certified to him
by the Clerk of Council. (Ord. 4357. Passed 2-8-11.)
913.10 ENFORCEMENT.
         (a)    If sidewalks, curbs or gutters are not installed per Section

bounding and abutting thereon. The assessment shall be collected in the same
manner, with penalty of ten percent (10%), as in the case of improvement under
the laws of the State.

ordinary first class mail to his or her last known address and also shall be
sent to the occupant of the property, if there is one. The notice shall advise
the recipient of his right of appeal under Section 913.21. Such fines may be
collected by civil suit if not otherwise paid. The City Engineer, in the
exercise of his reasonable discretion, may extend the time for compliance and
abate the daily fine.
   (c)   The foregoing remedies shall not be deemed exclusive and shall be in
addition to the procedures provided for in ORC Chapters 727 and 729 otherwise
by law.

Engineer. The City Engineer shall immediately transmit to the Board his entire
written record of the matter.

petitions shall bear the approval of seventy-five percent (75%) of the
landowners or eighty percent (80%) of the owners of the foot frontage of the
lands bounding and abutting upon the extensions with the following exceptions
for sanitary sewers:
      (1)   New subdivisions where Subdivision Regulations shall govern.
      (2)   Any dedicated right of way where the property on each side of the
proposed extensions has been previously assessed for a sewer.
      (3)   Dedicated streets where it is impossible for the petitioner to
obtain the proper percentage of signatures.
   (b)   The petitioners shall further bear the agreement of the landowners to
assume the costs of the extension as set forth in Section
927.02.
(1984 Code Sec. 50.01)
927.02 COST; SIZE OF MAINS; PAYMENT OF LEAD-INS.
   (a)   The cost of the extension of any water main on any duly dedicated and
accepted street in the City shall be borne on the basis of sixty percent (60%)
of the cost paid by the owners of the land bounding and abutting on the
extension and forty percent (40%) paid by the City. Such percentages apply up
to and including six inch mains and, if the City deems it necessary to have a
larger size main, the additional cost of the main shall be borne by the City.
The size of the main shall be determined by the City Engineer.
   (b)   The cost of the extension of any gas main on any duly dedicated and
accepted street in the City shall be borne on the basis of sixty percent (60%)
of the cost paid by the owners of the land bounding and abutting on the
extension and forty percent (40%) paid by the City. The percentages apply up to
and including six inch mains and, if the City deems it necessary to have a
larger size main, the additional cost of the main shall be borne by the City.
The size of the main shall be determined by the City Engineer.
   (c)   The owners of the foot frontage shall pay for all lead-ins from the
main to the property line at their sole expense on all of the above extensions
of water, gas or sanitary sewer.
   (d)   The total cost of all local service sewers and laterals shall be
assessed to the property owners when installed after being petitioned by
seventy-five percent (75%) of the property owners or eighty percent (80%) of
the frontage benefitted by the sewer. The City shall bear the cost of providing
a suitable outlet for the proposed extension within the right-of-way limits of
the street containing the outlet sewer in all cases. Trunk sewers shall be
installed at the expense of the City.
   (e)   On any dedicated right of way where the exception in
927.01(a)(2) applies, the petitioners shall bear sixty percent (60%) of the
cost of the sewer and the City forty percent (40%) of the cost for the frontage
which cannot be assessed if so approved by Council.
   (f)   On any dedicated right of way where it is considered necessary for the
health, progress and welfare of the City by the Superintendent of Public Works
and Council to install a sanitary sewer, Council may order the construction of
a local service sewer and assess the total cost of the sewer to all the owners
of all the lots benefitted by an improvement without the percentage of
signatures of owners as specified by the rule of petition in Section
927.01. If this method is not considered economically feasible and fifty
percent (50%) of the property owners on the improvement have signed a petition,
Council may order the construction on a basis of sixty percent (60%) of the
total cost of the sewer main assessed to the petitioners and forty percent
(40%) to the City. In this case, a record of parcels not assessed shall be
given to the Public Works office and any future permit applications shall cost
the applicant three times the current permit or tapping charge.

prorated cost that the property owner would have had to pay had he made the
tie-in at the time the water line was extended originally.
         (b)    The Director shall refund to the party originally paying for
the extension of the water main the sum so collected from the property owner
who ties into the water at a later date.

computed by the Engineer of the City.
         (d)    New metered water services for new construction shall have an

person or legal entity shall hold the City harmless in matters related to the
opening or excavation.
   (c)   If any person or legal entity needs to perform an emergency street
opening to repair a public utility line, and there is not sufficient time to
obtain a permit, the person or legal entity may perform the street opening then
provide notice to the City Engineer before the close of the next business day.
This does not relieve the person or legal entity from the other requirements of
this section.

($1,600.00) per EDU unless acted upon otherwise by Urbana City Council.
      (3)   The EDU multiple established for non-residential properties based
on estimated water consumption shall be reviewed twelve (12) months after
occupancy is obtained to determine if the estimated daily water consumption is
accurate. The Director may extend this 12-month time period if accurate
consumption data is not available. Any increase or decrease in the EDU multiple
based on actual water consumption which results in a capacity fee charge
adjustment of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be communicated to
the property owner in writing. Any additional capacity fee charge or any refund
of a previously paid capacity fee charge shall be made within forty-five (45)
days of the date of the amended EDU determination letter. An owner may contest
the amended EDU assigned to the property by filing an appeal with the Director
within forty-five (45) days of the date of the amended EDU determination
letter. The appeal shall be in writing and shall state the grounds for the
appeal. The Director shall cause an appropriate investigation to be made to
determine whether an adjustment of the EDU multiple for the property is
warranted. The appellant shall be notified in writing of the Director's
determination with respect to the appeal and any resulting adjustment in the
amount of the capacity fee charge. Any additional capacity fee charge or any
refund of a previously paid capacity fee charge shall be made within forty-five
(45) days or the date of the Director's written response to the appellant.
   (c)   New sanitary sewer connection permits issued for properties located

      (Ord. 4168. Passed 6-24-03.)
937.02 GENERAL CRITERIA.
   (a)    Installation Requirements for New Food Service Facilities. All
proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the CHD/UPW water
Service area may be required to install an approved, properly operated and
maintained grease interceptor subject to the determination of the CHD.
   (b)    Phased Implementation Plan for Existing Food Service Facilities. All
existing food service facilities inside the CHD/UPW Wastewater Service area are
expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured
on the user's premises and then properly disposed of. Existing Food Service
Facilities will typically be handled under CHD/UPW's Grease Control Program.
      (1)   CHD/UPW will periodically inspect each Food Service Facility on an
as- needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of
the Grease Control Program. CHD/UPW's goal is to achieve compliance by all
existing Food Service Facilities.
      (2)   Through preventive maintenance records or emergency calls related
to grease, CHD/UPW will identify and target "grease problem areas" in the
wastewater collection system. Food Service Facilities located upstream of these
problem areas and discharging their waste water into the "problem" lines will
be identified as potential contributors to the grease build-up. CHD/UPW
inspects the grease interceptors of al1 food service facilities in the vicinity
of the “problem area”, making note of maintenance records, sizing, and
condition.
      (3)   Each Food Service Facility in the vicinity of the problem area will
be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of
their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance
records will also be reviewed.
      (4)   Following the inspections, CHD/UPW will send written notice to the
inspected food service facilities, containing an educational brochure on grease
in the sewer system, a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of
the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following
actions:
         A.   Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized
grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the Grease Control Program
through effective grease control practices will be commended for their
compliance.
         B.   Facilities may be required to develop and submit to CHD/UPW a
proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and
increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
         C.   Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with
the intent of the Grease Control Program through improved housekeeping and
increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment
will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the
facility into compliance. An appropriate amount of time will be agreed upon
between CHD/UPW and the Customer.
   (c)    Floor Drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential
to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor.
   (d)    Garbage Grinders and Dishwashers. Garbage grinders or commercial
dishwashers shall not be connected to grease interceptors.
   (e)    Location.
      (1)   Each grease trap and grease interceptor shall be installed and
connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal
of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease interceptor may not be
installed in any part of a building unless approved in writing by CHD.
      (2)   Location of grease interceptors shall meet the approval of CHD. The
best location is in an area outside of an outside wall.
         (Ord. 4168. Passed 6-24-03.)
937.03 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)    Construction of Interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be
constructed in accordance with PDI standards and shall be in accordance with
Sections 1003.3.1 through 1003.3.4.2 of the Ohio Plumbing Code.
   (b)    Access. Access to grease traps and grease interceptors shall be
available at all times, to allow for their maintenance and inspection
   (c)    Load-Bearing Capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing
capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas).
   (d)    Inlet and Outlet Piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease trap or
grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor.
Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
   (e)    Interceptor Sizing. The required size of a grease interceptor shall
be approximated by using the CHD/UPW Grease Interceptor Sizing formula shown in
Appendix A. Most grease interceptors will have a capacity of not less than
1,000 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. If the calculated
capacity using the CHD/UPW Grease Interceptor sizing formula exceeds 3,000
gallons, multiple units in series shall be installed.
   See Appendix A for example of formula. Grease interceptor design represents
minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require
more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the
costs to provide additional measures if required by CHD/UPW. CHD/UPW reserves
the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities
with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease
discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the
formula.
(Ord. 4168. Passed 6-24-03.)
937.04 GREASE TRAP AND INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE.
   (a)    Cleaning/Pumping. The user at the user's expense shall maintain all
grease traps and interceptors. Maintenance of “under the sink” grease traps
shall include the removal of all fats, oil, and grease from the detention
compartment of the trap. Removal is usually accomplished by hand-dipping or
scooping the collected grease from the trap. Maintenance of grease interceptors
shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating
materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging
of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or
any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be
disposed, is prohibited.
   (b)    Cleaning/Pumping Frequency. “Under the sink” grease traps must be
cleaned no less than weekly. If grease traps are more than 50% ful1 when
cleaned weekly, the frequency shall be increased. Grease interceptors must be
pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months, or more frequently
as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection
system, unless it can be demonstrated to CHD/UPW that the pumping frequency can
be extended past the three month period.
   (c)    Disposal of Grease Interceptor Waste. All waste removed from each
grease interceptor must be disposed of at a facility approved by CHD/UPW to
receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way
shal1 the pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary
sewer collection system.
   (d)    Additives. The use of additives for the emulsion or reduction of oils
and greases is prohibited. Such additives shall include, but not be limited to,
biological enzymes or chemical agents.
   (e)    Chemical Treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, acid
and other chemicals designed to dissolve or remove grease shall not be allowed
to enter the grease interceptor.
   (f)   Maintenance Log. A Grease Interceptor Cleaning Record Maintenance Log
indicating each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be maintained by each
FSF. This log shall include the date inspected, inspected by, date cleaned,
cleaned by, service calls and remarks. The log shall be kept in a conspicuous
location for inspection. Said log shall be made immediately available to the
CHD/UPW representative upon request.
(Ord. 4168. Passed 6-24-03.)
937.05 ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Initial Data Acquisition. Upon inspection of each FSF, UPW's
inspector stall collect the Oil and Grease Trap Schedule to facilitate Ohio
EPA's review of UPW's Grease Control Program.
   (b)    Administrative Fee. An administrative fee for facilities with grease
discharges shall be set by CHD/UPW. The fee shall be established to insure full
cost recovery and shall include but not be limited to the cost of field,
administrative, engineering, and clerical expenses involved. The fees shall be
not less than $75.00 per year for each facility. The annual administrative fee
shall be applied to the customer's July water and sewer service bill.
   (c)    Inspection and Entry. Authorized personnel of CHD/UPW, bearing proper
credentials and identifications, shall have the right to enter upon all
properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification,
for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or
record review, in accordance with this program.
(Ord. 4168. Passed 6-24-03.)
937.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   UPW shal1 have the administrative authority to enforce this program.
Whenever UPW finds that any user has violated or is violating this program, or
any prohibition, limitation, or requirements contained herein, UPW will
initiate corrective action, which may include but be limited to the following:
   (a)    Notice of Violation. UPW may issue any user a written notice stating
the nature of violation. Within fifteen (15) days of the date of notice, a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to UPW by the user.
   (b)    Consent Order. UPW may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
the user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance with a time period
specified by the order.
   (c)    Administrative Order. When UPW finds that a user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions set forth in this program, or the order
issued thereunder, UPW may issue an order for compliance to the user
responsible for the discharge. Orders may contain any requirements as might be
reasonable, necessary, and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
but not be limited to the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring, and management practices.
   (d)    Emergency Suspension of Services. UPW may suspend water or sewer
service when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of UPW, in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which:
      (1)   Presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons or the environment;
      (2)   Causes stoppages, sanitary sewer overflows, or excessive
maintenance to be performed to prevent stoppages in the sanitary sewer
collection system;
      (3)   Causes interference to the POTW; or
      (4)   Causes UPW to violate any condition of its NPDES permits.
   Any person notified of a suspension of the water or sewer service shall
immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of the
person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, UPW shall take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate termination of water or sewer
service, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or sewer connection
or endangerment to any individuals. UPW shall reinstate the water or sewer
service when such conditions causing the suspension have been eliminated and
the reconnection fee paid. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measure(s) taken to
prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to UPW within fifteen (15)
days of the date of occurrence.
   (e)    Administrative Penalty. Notwithstanding any other remedies or
procedures available to UPW, any user who is found to have violated any
provision of this program, or any order issued hereunder, may be assessed an
administrative penalty of not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be
deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessment may be added to the
user's next scheduled sewer service charge and UPW shal1 have such other
collection remedies as are available by law.
   (f)    Request for Hearing and Appeal. Any person affected by a penalty,
order, or directive of UPW issued pursuant to this program may, within ten (10)
days of the issuance of such penalty, order, or directive, request a hearing in
writing before UPW to show cause why such should be modified or made to not
apply to such person. The requested hearing shall be held as soon as practical
after receiving the request, at which time the person affected shall have an
opportunity to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, UPW shall issue a
written response to the person requesting the hearing affirming, modifying, or
rescinding the penalty, order, or directive at issue.

   (a)   No person shall make a service connection to the City's water system
or any part thereof, unless the City has issued a permit to do so.
   (b)   The following capacity fee shall be charged for all permits issued to
connect into the City water system for the first time and shall be paid upon
issuance of said permit.
      (1)   All properties connecting to the City of Urbana water system shall
be assigned an Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU), or multiple thereof, with one
(1) EDU being equal to average daily water consumption of 400 gallons.
         A.   All single-family residential properties connecting to the water
system are assigned one (1) EDU.
         B.   All multi-family dwellings connecting to the water system shall
be assigned one (1) EDU per each residential dwelling unit.
         C.   All properties connecting to the water system that are not
residential properties are to be assigned by the Director of Administration, an
EDU multiple based upon the properties’ estimated daily water consumption (in
gallons) divided by 400 gallons (one EDU). In no event shall a non-residential
property be assigned an EDU of less than one (1).
      (2)   The capacity fee shall be one thousand six hundred dollars
($1,600.00) per EDU unless acted upon otherwise by Urbana City Council.
      (3)   The EDU multiple established for non-residential properties based
on estimated water consumption shall be reviewed twelve (12) months after
occupancy is obtained to determine if the estimated daily water consumption is
accurate. The Director may extend this 12-month time period if accurate
consumption data is not available. Any increase or decrease in the EDU multiple
based on actual water consumption which results in a capacity fee charge
adjustment of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be communicated to
the property owner in writing. Any additional capacity fee charge or any refund
of a previously paid capacity fee charge shall be made within forty-five (45)
days of the date of the amended EDU determination letter. An owner may contest
the amended EDU assigned to the property by filing an appeal with the Director
within forty-five (45) days of the date of the amended EDU determination
letter. The appeal shall be in writing and shall state the grounds for the
appeal. The Director shall cause an appropriate investigation to be made to
determine whether an adjustment of the EDU multiple for the property is
warranted. The appellant shall be notified in writing of the Director's
determination with respect to the appeal and any resulting adjustment in the
amount of the capacity fee charge. Any additional capacity fee charge or any
refund of a previously paid capacity fee charge shall be made within forty-five
(45) days or the date of the Director's written response to the appellant.
      (4)   The water utility system capacity fee charge for all properties
connecting to the water system which are not residential properties and whose
estimated daily water consumption is greater than 50,000 gallons per day shall
be determined based on an evaluation made of the specific impact on the water
utility system for said connection.
   (c)   New water connection permits issued for properties located outside of
the City limits will be charged the above mentioned fee on condition that the
owner of the property to be served shall, within sixty days of the time said
property becomes contiguous to the City of Urbana, prepare and file or join in
the preparation and filing of an annexation petition pursuant to Ohio R.C.
709.02 for such property to be annexed to the City of Urbana. The failure of
any such non-resident water customer to comply with this condition shall be
grounds for immediate termination of water service to the property. This
provision may be waived by the City Administrator, with the concurrence of City
Council, upon a finding of the existence of a specific necessity.
   (d)   Subsection (b) hereof shall not apply to the holder of a zoning permit
issued prior to the effective date of this section for which fees have been
paid and actual connection to the water system occurs within 365 days after the
issuance of such permit.

other than the intended source of the potable water supply.
   (e)    “Backflow prevention device” means any device, method, or type of
constriction intended to prevent backflow into a potable water system.
   (f)    “Consumer” means the owner or person in control of any premises
supplied by or in any manner connected to a public water system.
   (g)    “Consumer's water system” means any water system, located on the
consumer's premises, supplied by or in any manner connected to a public water
system. A household plumbing system is considered to be a consumer's water
system.
   (h)    “Contamination” means an impairment of the quality of the water by
sewage or process fluids or waste to a degree which could create an actual
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through spread of disease by
exposure.
   (i)    “Cross-connection” means any arrangement whereby backflow can occur.
   (j)    “Degree of hazard” means a term derived from an evaluation of the
potential risk to health and the adverse effect upon the potable water system.
   (k)    “Director” means the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency or his duly authorized representative.
   (l)    “Double check valve assembly” means an assembly composed of two

the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters
for domestic use.
   (r)    “Potable water” means water which is satisfactory for drinking,
culinary, and domestic purposes and meets the requirements of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
   (s)    “Process fluids” means any fluid or solution which may be chemically,

device containing a minimum of two independently acting check valves together
with an automatically operated pressure differential relief valve located
between two check valves. During normal flow and at the cessation of normal
flow, the pressure between these two checks shall be less than the supply
pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief
valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure
between the check valves at less than the supply pressure. The unit must
include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the device, and
each device shall be fitted with properly located test cocks.

   The Building and Zoning Appeals Board shall hold a public hearing within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of a conditional use permit application from

1105.33 VARIANCES.
   The Building and Zoning Appeals Board may authorize upon appeal in specific
cases such variances from the terms of this Part as will not be contrary to the
public interest where the following standards are met, owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Part would result
in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures
or buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of
lands, structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds
for issuance of a variance.
   Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but
only where strict application of the provisions of this Part would result in
unnecessary hardship. Furthermore, no variance for use of land shall be issued:
   (a)   Conditions prevailing. Where there are exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances or conditions, the literal enforcement of the requirements of
this Zoning Code would involve practical difficulty or would cause unnecessary
hardship, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the
Board shall have power to relieve such hardship. In authorizing a variance, the
Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and
other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the
interest of the furtherance of the purpose of the Zoning Code and in the public
interest. In authorizing a variance, with attached conditions, the Board shall
require such evidence and guarantee or bond as it may deem to be necessary, to
enforce compliance with the conditions attached.
   (b)   Findings of the Board. No such variance of the provisions or
requirements of this Zoning Code shall be authorized by the Board unless the
Board finds that ALL of the following facts and conditions exist:
      (1)   Exceptional circumstances. Where, by reason of the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a specific piece of property on
the effective date of this Zoning Code, or by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions, or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of
property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the
piece of property in question, there are exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question or to the
intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties
or classes of uses on the same zoning district.
      (2)   Preservation of property rights. That such variance is necessary
for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights which are
possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the same
vicinity.
      (3)   Absence of detriment. That the authorizing of such variance will
not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and will not materially
impair the purposes of this Zoning Code or the public interest.
      (4)   Not of general nature. That the condition or situation of the
subject property, or the intended use of the property, for which variance is
sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably
practical the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or
situation.
1105.34 APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   The following shall apply to the application for a variance:
   (a)   A variance from the terms of this Part shall not be granted by the
Building and Zoning Appeals Board unless and until a written application for a
variance is submitted to the Zoning Inspector and the Board containing:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   Legal description of property;
      (3)   Description of nature of variance requested;
      (4)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the standards.

findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it,
which support conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed by
subsection(a)(4) hereof have been met by the applicant.
1105.35 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   Under no circumstances shall the Building and Zoning Appeals Board grant an
appeal or variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Part
in the district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by
the terms of this Part in such district. In granting any appeal or variance,
the Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this Part. Violation of the conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be deemed a
violation of this Part.
1105.36 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BUILDING AND ZONING APPEALS BOARD.
   The Building and Zoning Appeals Board shall hold a public hearing within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for an appeal or variance
from the Zoning Inspector or an applicant. (Ord. 4015. Passed 11-4-96.)
1105.37 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING IN NEWSPAPER.
   Before holding the public hearing required in Section
1105.36, notice of the hearing shall be given in one newspaper of general

with supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1105.35 or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Board shall
further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the
land, building or structure. Appeals from Board decisions shall be made in the
manner specified in Section
1105.08.

of the members of the Planning Commission present at a meeting thereof may vote
to extend the said period for a period of time not to exceed an additional
sixty (60) days.
1110.04 SITE PLAN REVIEW GUIDELINES.
   The following principles shall guide the site planning review by the
Planning Commission:
   (a)   The natural topographic and landscape features of the site shall be
incorporated into the plan and the development whenever feasible.
   (b)   Buildings and open spaces should be in proportion and in scale with
existing structures and spaces in the area within three hundred (300) feet of
the development site.
   (c)   A site that has an appearance of being congested, over built or
cluttered can evolve into a blighting influence and therefore such should not
be congested, over built or cluttered.
   (d)   Open spaces should be linked together.
   (e)   Natural separation should be preserved or created on the site by
careful planning of the streets and clustering of buildings using natural
features and open spaces for separation. Existing vegetation removal should be
kept to a minimum.
   (f)   Screening of intensive uses should be provided by utilizing
landscaping, fences or walls to enclose internal areas.
   (g)   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non-random fashion. Long,
unbroken building facades should be avoided.
   (h)   In connection with the siting of buildings, the location should be
oriented to maximize the privacy of the occupants of adjacent buildings.
   (i)   Street location and design shall conform to existing topographic
characteristics. Cutting and filling shall be minimized in the construction of
streets. Flat as possible grades shall be utilized proximate to intersections.
   (j)   Pedestrian circulation in non-residential areas should be arranged so
that off-street parking areas are located within a convenient walking distance
of the use being served. Handicapped parking should be located as near as
possible to be accessible to the structure. Pedestrian and vehicular
circulation should be separated as much as possible, through crosswalks
designated by pavement markings, signalization or complete grade separation.
   (k)   Path and sidewalk street crossings should be located where there is a
good sight distance along the road, preferably away from sharp bends or sudden
changes in grade.
   (l)   Parking lots and garages should be located in such a way as to provide
safe, convenient ingress and egress. Whenever possible there should be a
sharing of curb cuts of more than one facility. Parking areas should be
screened and landscaped and traffic islands should be provided to protect
circulating vehicles and to break up the monotony of continuously paved areas.
   (m)   Drive through establishments such as restaurants and banks should be
located to allow enough automobile waiting space for peak hour operation
without interference with other parking lot circulations.
1110.05 SIGNS.
   The following guidelines apply to the application of signs in the site plan
review process:
   (a)   For new developments, signs shall be reviewed as part of the site plan
review process. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to modify sign
regulations as part of the site plan review based upon written findings.
   (b)   For existing buildings with new signs that do not comply to district
requirements, the Planning Commission can approve the sign, with written
modifications and findings, related to compensation by the owner in the form of
overall site improvements (i.e. increased landscaping).
   (c)   All variances for signs shall be filed with the Board of Building and
Zoning Appeals pursuant to Section
1105.33.

1112.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   General. City Council, consistent with the mission and findings of the
Downtown Revitalization Committee, and being mindful of the proud history of
Urbana and of the importance of the downtown's character and architectural
heritage in the every day lives of its citizens and in promoting business and
economic development hereby declares as a matter of public policy that the
preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, development and redevelopment of the
downtown are matters of public necessity involving the health, safety, and
welfare of its residents and businesses.
   The purpose of this Chapter, the "City Center Heritage Overlay District", is
to:
      (1)   Provide supplemental regulations or standards which are consistent
with the City's intent to guide public and private actions within the Overlay
District in terms of redevelopment and re-use of existing land and structures,
new development, and the preservation of the area's historic character and
architecturally significant structures. These supplemental regulations are in
addition to "base" or underlying zoning district regulations applicable in the
"B-3 Central Business District". Whenever there is a conflict between the
regulations of the underlying district and those of the overlay district, the
overlay district regulations will control;
      (2)   Provide a more flexible instrument which governs development by the
urban design principles and guidelines of building placement, building form and
character, access and parking placement, and the availability of pedestrian
amenities to establish and support a pedestrian-friendly shopping and civic
center, contrary to conventional development control strictly by type of use;
      (3)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the Overlay
District by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures within it, and to prevent intrusions and alterations within the
Overlay District that would be incompatible with the established character; and
      (4)   Provide for a means of design review for those aspects of
redevelopment and new development within the Overlay District in order to
ensure compatibility with the District's character, scale, building fabric, and
historic architectural elements, in an effort to achieve a more attractive and
viable business and civic environment for the City's residents and visitors.
   (b)   Objectives. The City Center Heritage Overlay District is specifically
designed to:
      (1)   Maintain, promote and ensure Urbana's downtown as its historic
business and civic center.
      (2)   Provide for increased opportunities and land use efficiency for
redevelopment, new development and business development expansion.
      (3)   Assist property owners to rehabilitate their property and receive
tax credits.
      (4)   Protect property and private investment.
      (5)   Encourage a viable and compatible mix of commercial, business,
office, and residential uses in the district.
      (6)   Discourage the use of property with small and isolated free-
standing structures oriented primarily to automobile traffic.
      (7)   Discourage the development of building additions and new
construction which require large buildings, incompatible with the character and
scale of the district.
      (8)   Maintain a continuous building form, parallel to the street, and
without setbacks from the right-of-way.
      (9)   Prevent abrupt and severe differences and change in the character
of development.
      (10)   Enhance the distinguishable character and scale of Urbana's city
center.
      (11)   Protect the historically significant and other contributing
structures and promote their longevity as a viable resources for re-use and
redevelopment.
      (12)   Allow the application of performance standards to development and
redevelopment so as to mitigate any adverse impacts on adjacent areas and the
overall district.
      (13)   Promote public health, safety and welfare.

1117.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Part or any amendment that may
later be adopted, there exists lots, uses of land, structures and uses of
structures and land in combination which were lawful before this Part was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under
the terms of this Part or future amendments. It is the intent of this Part to
permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed. It is further
the intent of this Part that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, nor be used as ground for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
1117.02 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Part shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Part and upon which actual building construction had been
carried on diligently. Actual construction includes the placing of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, the demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction, provided that the work is carried out diligently.
1117.03 SINGLE NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.   
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this section
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this section. The
lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other
lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though the lot
fails to meet the requirements for area or width or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements,
other than those applying to area or width or both, of the lot conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variances of
requirements listed in Chapters
1120  through
1126 , other than lot area or lot width, shall be obtained only through action
of the Building and Zoning Appeals Board as provided in Sections
1105.33  to
1105.39 . Also, in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
lots of record combined that included an existing single-family dwelling and
another existing principal use at the time of their most recent combination may
be separated only through action of the Building and Zoning Appeals Board into
the configuration at the time of their most recent combination. This provision
shall apply even though the lots fail to meet the requirements for area or
width or both, that are generally applicable in the district. This is not
intended to authorize the sale of land described as prohibited in Section
1117.04 .
(Ord. 4387. Passed 10-23-12.)
1117.04 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD IN COMBINATION.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in a single ownership are of record at the time of passage
or amendment of this Part and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
Zoning Code and no portion of the parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this Zoning Code.
1117.05 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this Part, lawful uses of land exist which
would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning Code, the uses
may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
   (a)   No such non-conforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Part.
   (b)   No such non-conforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by the uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Part.
   (c)   If any such non-conforming uses of land are discontinued or abandoned
for more than one (1) year except when government action impedes access to the
premises, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Part for the district in which the land is located.
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Part shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land.
1117.06 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Part that could not be built under the terms of this Part by
reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot, bulk or other requirements concerning the structure, the structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   (a)   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion may be altered
to decrease its non-conformity;
   (b)   Should the non-conforming structure or a non-conforming portion of
structure be damaged by more than 50% of its fair market value by fire or an
act of God, it may, only after approval by the Building and Zoning Appeals
Board be reconstructed as it previously existed. All remaining debris shall be
cleared away and disposed of properly within two months of the time of
destruction. If the structure is damaged 50% or less of the fair market value,
the non-conforming structure may be restored on the same footprint, provided
such restoration shall begin within six months from the time of damage.
   (c)   Should the structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
1117.07 NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and land
in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Part that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Part,
the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject
to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Part in
the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
   (b)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Part, but no such use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside the building;
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure or structure and land, may, upon appeal to the Building and Zoning
Appeals Board, be changed to another non-conforming use provided that the
Building and Zoning Appeals Board finds that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-
conforming use. In permitting the change, the Building and Zoning Board may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with other provisions
of this Part;
   (d)   Any structure, or structures and land in combination, in or on which a
non- conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
   (e)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for more than one (1) year, except
when government action impedes access to the premises, the structure or
structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
   (f)   Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-
conforming status of the land.
1117.08 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-
conforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when it became non- conforming shall not be
increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening
or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
the officials.
1117.09 USES UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS NOT NON- CONFORMING USES.   
   Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district shall not be
deemed a non- conforming use in such district, but shall without further action
be considered a conforming use.

1123.01 PURPOSE.
   The desired development pattern is to accommodate continued residential
development and use while allowing for neighborhood-scale retail and
institutional uses. Commercial and residential
development will be of high character, quality and charm reflected in the
existing architecture. All
uses should be relatively nuisance-free to surrounding residents and not
detract from the residential
purpose and character of the surrounding neighborhood. Access to this district
should be directly
from an arterial or collector street and not through a residential district.
Residential and
commercial uses may be mixed within the same building or structure with
applicable zoning and
building code requirements being met.

sides which adjoin or face any property used for residential purposes, by an
acceptably designed fence or planting screen. Such fence or planting screen
shall be not less than four feet nor more than six feet in height and shall be
maintained in good condition. In the event that terrain or other natural

other circulation areas shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of surface
water which might accumulate within or upon such area, and shall be designed to
prevent the excess drainage of surface water onto adjacent properties, walkways
or onto public streets. Adequate arrangements shall be made to insure
acceptable diversion to an adequate storm water drainage system.
   (g)   Barriers. Wherever a parking lot extends to a property line, fencing,
wheelstops, curbs or other suitable barriers shall be provided in order to
prevent any part of a parked vehicle from extending beyond the property line
and from destroying the screening materials.

be striped with painted lines five inches wide between stalls to facilitate the
movement into and out of the parking stalls. Lines shall be maintained in a
good, visible condition.
   (j)   Maintenance. Any owner of property used for parking areas shall

establishments, the required spaces may be located not farther than 700 feet
from the building served.
   (b)   The total of such off-street parking spaces supplied collectively
shall be not less than the sum of the requirements for the various uses

1137.15 PERMITS REQUIRED.
   (a)   General. All signs shall require permits and a payment of fees. As
part of the required application, plans and specifications shall be filed with
the Planning and Zoning Department showing the dimensions, materials, and
required details of construction, including loads, stresses, and anchorage.
   (b)   New Signs. A new sign shall not hereafter be erected, constructed,
altered, or maintained except as herein provided and until after a permit, if
required, has been issued by the Planning and Zoning Department.
   (c)   Alterations. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated except in
conformity to the provisions of this chapter for new signs, nor until a proper
permit has been secured. The changing of movable parts of an approved sign that
is designed for such changes, or the repainting or reposting of display matter,
shall not be deemed an alteration, provided the conditions of the original
approval and the requirements of this chapter are not violated.
   (d)   Permit Fees. All applications for permits filed with the Administrator
shall be accompanied by a payment of the initial permit fee for each sign as
determined by the Board of Control. A schedule of fees is available at the
Planning and Zoning Department.
   (e)    Permit Conditions, Refunds, and Penalties. A permit issued by the
Administrator becomes null and void if work is not commenced within ninety (90)
days of issuance. If work is suspended or abandoned for thirty days, the permit

(Ord. 4312. Passed 11-10-09.)
1137.19 VARIANCE.
   In the case of special circumstances or conditions where the strict
application of the requirements of this chapter would deprive a property owner
of a reasonable right to have signage, the Planning Commission shall have the
power to vary or adapt the requirements of this chapter. In granting a variance
the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to
ensure conformity with the surrounding neighborhood. A variance may only be
granted if the Commission finds the following:
   (a)   Special Circumstances and Conditions. There are special circumstances
or conditions, fully documented in the findings that are peculiar to the land
and/or building and do not generally apply to land and buildings in the
surrounding neighborhood.
   (b)   Minimum variance. The variance granted by the Planning Commission
shall be the minimum variance needed to accomplish the purpose.
   (c)   Absence of Detriment. The granting of the variance will be in harmony
with the general purpose and intent of the chapter, and will not be injurious
to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   (d)   Not of a General Nature. The condition or situation of the specific
piece of property is not so general as to make reasonably practical the
formulation of a general regulation for the condition or situation.
   (e)   Action of Applicants. That the special conditions or circumstances did
not result from the actions of the applicant.
(Ord. 4312. Passed 11-10-09.)

power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that
there is error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by
the administrative official in the interpretation of the provisions of this
chapter. A hearing shall occur within 30 days after the Board of Zoning Appeals
receives the written appeal. A written decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall be made within 14 days after close of the appeal hearing. Any further

made on forms provided by the Administrator and shall be accompanied by such
data and information as will assure the fullest practicable presentation of the
facts for the permanent record. (Ord. 4312. Passed 11-10-09.)
1137.21 SIGNS IN VIOLATION.
   All signs shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the
Administrator and all permits are mere licenses subject to revocation by the
Administrator. When the Administrator finds that a sign for which a permit has
been issued is in violation of the permit conditions or a sign has been
installed without a permit, he or she shall proceed per Section
1137.99.
   (a)   Signs, Current. Any sign advertising or identifying a bonafide
business or product no longer being conducted or sold, shall be removed within
a reasonable time period established by the Administrator. When there is
failure to comply with such notice within the time specified, the Administrator
shall cause the removal of the sign and the owner of record or lessee of
property shall pay any expense incurred.
   (b)   Signs, Hazardous. The Administrator may cause any sign which is an
imminent hazard or immediate peril to the safety, health, and welfare of
persons or property to be removed summarily and without notice. This section
shall not be construed to prevent the repair or restoration to a safe condition
as directed by the building official or any part of an existing sign when
damaged by storm or other accidental emergency.
   (c)   Signs, Relocated. Any sign that is moved to another location either on
the same or to other premises shall be considered a new sign and a permit shall
be secured for any work performed in connection therewith when required by this
chapter.
   (d)   Signs, Removing or Reconstructing. A sign heretofore approved and
erected shall not be repaired, altered, or removed, reconstructed, rebuilt, or
relocated unless it is made to comply with all applicable requirements of this
chapter.
   (e)   Signs, Maintenance. All signs for which approval is required, together
with all their supports and anchors, shall be kept in repair in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter, and when not galvanized or constructed of
approved corrosion-resistive, noncombustible materials shall be painted when
necessary to prevent corrosion, deterioration, or a disorderly appearance.
   (f)   Signs, Lighting. Unless otherwise specified by this chapter, all signs
may be illuminated. However, no sign may utilize the following:

and without a sunscreen or comparable diffusion.
      (2)   Any revolving beacon light.
         (Ord. 4312. Passed 11-19-09.)

days after receiving written notice of said violation shall be subject to an
administrative fine as outlined in Section
1137.99 . Receipt of such written notice together with a copy of an applicable

administrative fine as outlined in Section
1137.99  for each day that the violation continues. Each day's violation shall
be a separate offense.
   (c)   Notice to Abate. The notice to abate shall describe the activity,
circumstance, or condition constituting the violation, designate the section
being violated, describe the steps necessary to be taken to abate the
violation, state the time limits within which abatement shall take place, and
advise the recipient of the right of appeal.
      (1)    The notice to abate may be served upon either the owner, the
tenant, or other person or legal entity in charge of or possession of the
property.
      (2)    Service of the notice to abate shall be by one of the following
methods:
         A.   By delivering a copy of the notice to the person or legal entity
to be served;
         B.   By posting the notice in a conspicuous place upon such property
in a form approved by the Director of Administration upon such property for a
period of five days.
         C.   By certified mail, addressed to such person at his/her usual

instruction to forward, return receipt requested, provided that the certified
envelope is not returned with an endorsement showing failure of delivery; or
         D.   By ordinary mail addressed as in subsection (c)(2)C. hereof after
a certified mail envelope is returned with an endorsement showing either that
the certified mail envelope was refused or unclaimed and the ordinary mail
envelope is not returned with an endorsement showing failure of delivery;
         E.   By publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in Champaign County when the name, usual place
of residence or business or existence of such person or legal entity is unknown
and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained or in the event all of the
other methods in subsections (c)(2)A. through D. hereof fail to effect delivery
of the notice.
   (d)   Signs in Public Right-of-way. Other than signs in compliance with
Section
1137.10  the Administrator shall cause the removal of signs located in public
rights-of-way without prior notice to the violator. The cost of the removal
shall be charged to the violator in addition to other penalties imposed by this
section.
   (e)   Failure to Remove or Alter. If the owner or occupant fails to remove
or alter a sign found by the City not to comply with the standards herein set
forth within five days after such notice from the Administrator, the City
Administrator may have such sign moved or altered at the expense of the owner
or occupant of the property.
   (f)   Failure to Obtain Permits. Failure to obtain permits before starting
work. Any person who shall commence any installation of a sign for which a
permit is required by this chapter without first having obtained a permit
therefore shall, if legally authorized and subsequently allowed to obtain a
permit, pay double permit fee.

1141.01 INTENT.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development Regulations is to encourage and
allow more creative and imaginative design for land development than is
possible under the more conventional zoning regulations. The Planned Unit
Development also provides for more efficient use of the land and thus may
result in more economical land development. Preservation of natural site
qualities, better urban amenities, more open spaces, and a higher quality
project may also be intended results of the Planned Unit Development process.
   The process is intended to be an alternative to the conventional subdivision
of land and lot by lot development contemplated by Title Five - Subdivision
Regulations, Codified Ordinances of the City of Urbana and the district
regulations of this Chapter. The following objectives may be attained though
the use of the Planned Unit Development process:
   (a)   To encourage renewal of older areas where new development and
restoration are needed to revitalize the areas.
   (b)   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities.
   (c)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features.
   (d)   The prevention and/or control of soil erosion and surface flooding.
   (e)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development and design and the construction of aesthetic
amenities.
   (f)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings and other facilities.
   (g)   A combination and coordination of architectural styles, building
forms, and building relationships with a possible mixing of different urban
uses in an innovative overall design.
   (h)   Innovations in residential, commercial and industrial development,
and/or a combination of these uses, so that growing demands of the population
may be met by greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by
the conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary to said
buildings.
   (i)   The combination of a number of review and approval procedures into a
single plan review and approval process.
   (j)   The use of public input and participation in the design and
development of innovative and creative land use proposals.
   (k)   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, and
welfare.
   The Planned Unit Development is intended to provide for projects
incorporating a single type of a variety of related uses which are planned,
developed and maintained as a unit. The Planned Unit Development should provide
amenities not otherwise required by law. Such development may consist of
conventionally subdivided lots, provided that the requirements of the City's
Subdivision Ordinance are met with respect to each lot included and provided
further that the platted lots are maintained in unified control, unsubdivided
property maintained in separate ownership but unified control.
   The Planned Unit Development may permit the transfer (where applicable) of
dwelling units from one portion of the tract to another and will permit the
clustering of dwelling units in one or more locations upon the tract. The
unique and substantially different character of Planned Unit Developments
requires that they be processed under a special plan review procedure. Planned
Unit Developments are of a different character than conventional subdivisions
or other projects requiring site plan review, requiring the establishment
herein of specific and additional procedures, standards and exceptions to
govern the recommendations of the Planning Commission and the action by the
City Council.
   A person, by choosing to develop property as a planned unit development,
elects to submit a contemplated development proposal to a legislative and
discretionary review by the Planning Commission and City Council.
(Ord. 4243. Passed 6-12-07.)
1141.02 DESIGNATION.
   It is the intent of this Code that the Planned Unit Development review
procedure be conducted as a substitute for subdivision review as under Chapters
1155,
1159, and
1161, Subdivision Regulations of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Urbana,
and site plan review required under the Conditional Use Permit procedure, or
procedure for obtaining a zoning variation. Planned Unit Development Districts
may be established or removed from the Zoning Map upon the application of a
property owner or owners, or upon the initiative of the City Council or
Planning Commission, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter
1113 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 4243. Passed 6-12-07.)
1141.03 CONFORMANCE WITH CITY PLANS.
   All planned unit developments shall be designed in such a manner as to
conform to the provisions of the City of Urbana major street plans, sewer
extension plans, water distribution system plans, and storm drainage plans.
(Ord. 4243. Passed 6-12-07.)
1141.04 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS.
   (a)   Procedure. Before developing a tract of land within the corporate
limits of the City as a planned unit development, the owner or developer shall
comply with the following Planned Unit Development Review Process consisting
of: the Pre-Application Conference, the Preliminary Development Plan, and the
Final Development Plan. Upon inquiry, the Zoning Administrator shall give the
owner the requirements for the application, City policies, and procedures to
follow throughout the PUD process.
      (1)   Pre-application conference. Prior to the submission of a
Preliminary Development Plan, the owner or developer of a Planned Unit
Development shall request and participate in a Pre-Application Conference with
the Planning Commission and City staff. Prior to the Pre-Application
Conference, the owner shall prepare and submit to the City Planning and Zoning
staff a sketch plan drawn to scale of the proposed planned development. This
sketch plan may then be reviewed by appropriate staff members, including, but
not limited to the Public Works Departments, Public Safety Departments,
Engineering Department, Planning Department, and Zoning Department for
technical review.
   The general outline of the proposed Planned Unit Development, as evidenced
schematically by the sketch plan, is to be considered at this meeting.
Thereafter, the Zoning Administrator shall furnish the applicant with written
comments regarding the proposed development including recommendations to inform
and assist the applicant prior to the preparation and submission of an
application for approval of a Preliminary Development Plan.
   Additional Pre-Application Conferences may be held with the mutual consent
of the applicant and the Zoning Administrator or other City staff and/or
Planning Commission members. lt is intended that the proposal submitted will be
in preliminary conceptual form and that following the anticipated review and
comments, the developer will proceed with preparing detailed plans for all of
the site for submission as a Preliminary Development Plan.
   There are not particular requirements for submission of materials, other
than the sketch plan at a pre-application conference. However, the more
information--sketch plans, site information, adjacent land uses, and proposed
density--the developer has, the more feedback he may get from the conference.
In addition, the more formalized the nature of the information the City staff
has available to them at such a conference, the further both parties can
proceed from this stage.
      (2)   Preliminary Development Plan.
         A.   Submission. The owner or developer shall submit to the City
Zoning and Planning Department, ten (10) copies of a Preliminary Development
Plan in the form and content required in Chapters
1161 and
1163. The filing fee established by the Board of Control, Chapter
1161.51, shall accompany the application.
         B.   Review. City Planning Commission shall review the proposed
Preliminary Development Plan at a regular session or at a special session.
Applicant is required to attend to answer questions posed by Planning
Commission. Planning Commission shall vote on a recommendation to City Council
for the approval of the Preliminary Development Plan.
         C.   Scheduling and Notification of Public Hearing. Upon receipt of
the recommendation of a Preliminary Development Plan by Planning Commission to
City Council, and receipt of the required filing fee, the City Council Clerk
shall give notice of a scheduled legislative public hearing in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in the City at least ten days before the date
of the hearing and a general description of the planned unit development. The
legislative public hearing shall be scheduled not later than at the first
regularly scheduled City Council meeting occurring within thirty (30) days
after the recommendation by Planning Commission is received by City Council
regarding the Preliminary Development Plan.
         D.   Distribution of Preliminary Development Plan to Council. The
Council Clerk shall route one copy of the plan to each member of the City
Council prior to their respective consideration and review of the plan.
         E.   Legislative Public Hearing. City Council shall conduct a
legislative public hearing on the Preliminary Development Plan not later than
thirty (30) days after the receipt of Planning Commission recommendation of the
Preliminary Development Plan.
         F.   Council Approval or Rejection of a Proposed Preliminary
Development Plan. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Planning
Commission recommendation or within 180 days from the filing date of the
Preliminary Development Plan, whichever occurs first, the City Council shall
approve or reject the proposed Preliminary Development Plan, or return the
proposed Preliminary Development Plan to Planning Commission for
reconsideration. Failure of City Council to act within the prescribed time
period shall constitute approva1 of the Preliminary Plan.
         G.   Extension of Time Period by Mutual Consent. Time periods for
review by the Planning Commission or City Council may be extended by mutual
consent of the owner or developer and the Planning Commission or Council. Any
such extension shall stay the running of all subsequent time periods.
         H.   Extension of Preliminary Development Plans. Approved Preliminary
Development Plans or portions thereof on which no Final Development Plan has
been submitted for review and approval shall expire and be of no force or
effect two (2) years after this approval, except:
            1.   The filing of a Final Development Plan and necessary
supporting documents pursuant to subsection (a)(3) hereof shall extend the life
of a remaining valid preliminary development plan for one year; or
            2.   If the life of a Preliminary Development Plan is extended by
action of City Council.
      (3)   Final Development Plan.
         A.   Submission. Within two (2) years from the approval of a
Preliminary Development Plan or one (1) year from the most recent Council
action extending the life of an approved Preliminary Development Plan, the
owner or developer shall submit to the City Council Clerk twenty (20) copies of
a Final Development Plan, in a form and providing all the information, data,
and supporting material required by Section
1161.04  of the Subdivision Code and retaining the design characteristics of
the approved Preliminary Development Plan. Some of this process may be waived
based on changes made to the preliminary development plan at the discretion of
staff, Planning Commission, or a combination thereof.
         B.   Distribution of Final Development Plan for Review and Comment.
The City Clerk shall route one or more copies of the Final Development Plan to
City staff members for review and comment. One copy of the Final Development
Plan shall be provided to each member of the City Council and Planning
Commission prior to their consideration of the plan.
         C.   Recommendation and Criteria for Recommendation by Planning
Commission. Within thirty (30) days from the submission of a Final Development
Plan and supporting materials, the Planning Commission shall recommend that the
final development plan be approved as presented, approved with supplementary
conditions or disapproved. Before making its recommendation, the Planning
Commission shall find that the facts submitted with the application and
presented at the public hearing establish that:
            1.   The proposed development can be initiated within two years of
the date of approval.
            2.   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that the objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which could not be achieved under standard district
regulations.
            3.   The streets and thoroughfares proposed (where applicable) are
suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities
will not generate traffic in the amounts as to overload the street network
outside the planned unit development.
            4.   Proposed commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed.
            5.   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted
by the design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan in
accord with the planned unit development and the adopted policy of the
Commission and Council.
            6.   The area surrounding the development can be planned and zoned
in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
            7.   The planned unit development is in general conformance with
the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
            8.   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for
the population densities and nonresidential uses proposed.
      (4)   City Council review, referral and approval or disapproval. The City
Council shall review the final development plan to determine the extent to
which it conforms to the approved Preliminary Plan and approved public
improvement plans and specifications and shall further review the supporting
material to determine its conformance with the requirements of this Code. If
the final development plan substantially conforms to the approved preliminary
development plan and public improvement plans and specifications and if the
supporting material meets all Code requirements, then the Council shall approve
the Fina1 Development Plan by ordinance within thirty (30) days from the date
of its review. If the Final Development Plan does not in some way substantially
conform with the approved preliminary development plan or if the supporting
material does not conform with all Code requirements, then the Council, within
thirty (30) days from the date of its review, shall take one of the following
actions:
         A.   By ordinance, approve the Final Development Plan;
         B.   By ordinance, approve the Final Development Plan, with
conditions;
         C.   By ordinance, disapprove the Final Development Plan;
         D.   Refer the Final Development Plan to the Planning Commission for
reconsideration, at which time and place the Planning Commission shall
determine the extent to which the revised final development plan conforms or
fails to conform with the standards of this Code. The Planning Commission
shall, not later than ninety (90) days after the adjournment of the public
meeting, transmit its recommendation on the revised Final Development Plan to
the City Council. Within sixty (60) days from the receipt of the Planning
Commission's recommendation with respect to the revised final development plan,
the City Council shall, by ordinance, approve or disapprove the plan.
   (b)   Recording. Within seven (7) days from the date of adoption of an
ordinance approving the Final Development Plan, or within seven (7) days from
the date on which the last event referred to in this Code or characterized in
the ordinance as a pre-requisite to recording of the Final Development Plan
occurs, whichever is later, the City Clerk shall record a Notice of Approval of
the Final Plan together with the legal description of the property subject to
the Final Plan in the office of the Recorder of Champaign County, Ohio.
   (c)   Changes in the Final Development Plan.
      (1)   Minor changes. Minor changes in the location, setting, height or
character of the buildings and structures may be authorized by the Zoning
Administrator, if required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen
at the time of adoption of the ordinance approving the Final Development Plan.
      (2)   No change authorized by this subsection may cause any of the
following:
         A.    A change in the use or character of the development;
         B.   An increase in overall coverage of structures;
         C.   An increase in the intensity of use of over ten (10%) percent;
         D.   An increase in any dimension of a building or structure by more
than five percent (5%) in any direction;
         E.   A reduction in approved open space of five percent (5%) or more;

percent (5%) or more; or
         G.   A reduction in required pavement widths of five (5%) percent or
more.
      (3)   Non-minor changes. Decisions concerning approval or disapproval or
modifications of proposed non-minor changes in a Final Development Plan shall
be by the City Council after conducting an additional legislative public
hearing and submitted recommendation from the Planning Commission on such
proposed change.
   (d)   Revocation of Approved Planned Unit Development.
      (1)   The City Council may consider an approved final planned unit
development plan subject to revocation if construction falls more than two (2)
years behind the schedule filed with the final development plan or if
development exceeds five (5) years, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon
expiration date.
      (2)   The owner of property in a planned unit development plan or the
owner of any portion thereof may petition for revocation of such planned unit
development plan in whole or in part.
      (3)   Upon initiation by City Council or the owner of property in an
approved planned unit development requesting vacation of such planned unit
development in whole or in part, Council shall refer such item to the Planning
Commission for a recommendation and shall set a public hearing. Notice of such
hearing shall be provided by the Clerk of Council in the manner set forth for
legislative public hearings by the City Council. Additionally, the Clerk of
Council shall provide personal notice to all persons having an ownership
interest in such planned unit development. Such personal notice shall be
provided based on ownership recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of Champaign
County. Personal notice shall be by regular U.S. mail or personal delivery at
least ten (10) days prior to the public hearing on revocation.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall conduct a public meeting and make a
recommendation to the City Council regarding revocation of the planned unit
development.
      (5)   Upon receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation, the City
Council shall take up and consider the petition to revoke in whole or in part

(Ord. 4243. Passed 6-12-07.)
1141.08 SPECIFIC REGULATIONS FOR A B-2 MULTI-USE OFFICE PARK.
    (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the B-2, Multi-Use Office Park Planned Unit
Development is to accommodate new development and/or encourage the
redevelopment of or the re-use of an existing set of structures on a site that
has been vacated by the previous tenant and/or owner. The multi-use office park
has a controlled environment; it is not merely a free-standing office building,
but a cluster of structures having characteristics of the planned unit
development. In some respects the multi-use office park may be similar to the
shopping center and the industrial park. Like the shopping center, the multi-
use office park calls for unified control continuing management and services to
tenants, on-site parking for tenant-employees and for tenant-callers. Like the
industrial park, other features include on-site traffic circulation, extensive
landscaping, sign control and other covenants. Depending on its size and level
of employment, the multi-use office park may include corollary uses such as a
retail store, bank, restaurant, conference center and residential uses.
Flexibility is a factor in multi-use office park design. The grouping and use
of buildings may be designed to meet special requirements for a single tenant
or to provide for multiple tenants.
   (b)   Permitted Uses. Permitted Uses and Special Uses in the BR-1, B-2, and
R-2 Districts, except: correctional institutions, criminal rehabilitation
centers, farms, fraternities, sororities, gas company plants and facilities,
industrial centers, rooming houses, sanitary landfill and zoos. The application
or preliminary development plan for multi-use office park shall specify the
proposed use or uses and the location thereof during the Planned Unit
Development review and approval process, consideration of a proposed use or
development proposal which would otherwise be authorized by a special use
permit or after site plan review shall replace and be a substitute for the
special use permit review process or site plan review process.
   (c)   Minimum Land Area Requirement for a Multi-Use Office Park Planned Unit
Development. Five (5) acres. Smaller parcels may be considered on the basis of
their potential to satisfy the objectives of this chapter as stated in Section
1141.01 .
   (d)   Minimum Use Requirement. No multi-use office park shall contain less
than three (3) principal uses.
   (e)   Maximum Floor Area Requirement. Forty percent (40%) of the gross land
area in the planned unit development.
   (f)   Minimum Landscaped Open Space Requirement. Fifteen percent (15%) of
the gross land area in the planned unit development. Open recreational spaces
are encouraged for walking/bike paths, outdoor common seating, picnic areas,
etc. to increase quality of life among employees and visitors.
Interconnectivity with existing multi-use paths is also encouraged for
alternate transportation to and from the planned unit development site.
   (g)   Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirement. Parking provisions for
existing buildings in multi-use office parks have no standards. Each multi-use
office park is unique in its environment and characteristics and it is not
accurate to utilize generalized planning factors for these traffic and parking
generators. All uses within multi-use office parks are traffic generators,
however, they must accommodate the needs of those who use vehicles to visit
them. The multi-use office park must accommodate needs of a variety of parker
types; parking space needs must be considered in relation to use
characteristics, building layout and site constraints. Parking demand will vary
with the size of the multi-use office park and its activities. Parking
facilities should be large enough to accommodate worker shift changes, if any,
which is the peak time for parking. Because of differing uses located in a
multi-use office park, planning ratios of total employee or gross floor area
are unreliable for estimating parking needs. In order to evaluate parking space
needs, number of employees and building use should be accounted for on a site
specific basis. A definitive parking space needs estimate for each use in a
multi-use office park can be derived using four variables:
      (1)   Typical daily tenant-employee population;
      (2)   Typical daily tenant-caller population;
      (3)   Percent of tenant-employees being auto drivers; and
      (4)   Percent of tenant-callers being auto drivers.
   (h)   Based on the above guidelines, the final development plan for the
multi-use office park shall reflect parking adequate to handle proposed uses:
      (1)   Any new construction that takes place within a B-2 Multi-Use Office
Park Planned Unit Development shall meet all applicable regulations and
standards contained in other sections of this chapter of the Municipal Code.
      (2)   The City Council may waive any portion of the standards,
requirements or procedures for this section of the Code, provided that such
waivers are not contrary to the spirit, purpose and intent of this Code and in
accordance with all applicable Federal and State laws.
         (Ord. 4243. Passed 6-12-07.)

ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE
OF IMPROVEMENTS
1161.17 IMPROVEMENTS AND PERFORMANCE SURETY.
   In order that the City has the assurance that the construction and
installation of such improvements such as street surfacing, curbs, gutters,
storm sewers and appurtenances, sanitary sewer, waterlines, sidewalks, and
other required improvements will be constructed, the subdivider shall provide a
performance surety.
   (a)   Performance Surety - To get a final plat approved by the City Council,
the subdivider shall furnish either a bond, executed by a surety company, cash
deposit (certified check), or Irrevocable Letter of Credit (form must be
approved by the City Law Director) equal to the cost of construction of such
improvements as shown on the plans, and based on an estimate approved by the
City Engineer.
The performance surety, cash deposit (certified check), or Irrevocable Letter
of Credit to the City shall run for a period of one (1) year and be extendable
for two (2) years from the date of execution and shall provide that the
subdivider, their heirs, successors, assigns, and agent or servants will comply
with all applicable terms, conditions, provisions, and requirements of these
Regulations, and will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing
and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with such laws and
these Regulations. Before said surety is accepted it shall be approved by the
City Law Director. Whenever a cash deposit (certified check) is made, the same
shall be made out to the City.
   (b)   Extension of Time - If the construction or installation of any
improvement or facility, for which guarantee has been made by the developer in
the form of a surety, is not completed within two (2) years from the date of
final approval of the record plat, the developer may request the City to grant
an extension, provided he can show reasonable cause for inability to complete
said improvements within the required two (2) years.
   (c)   Acceptance of Dedication Offers - Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance
of the City Council. The approval by the Planning Commission of a subdivision
plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the local
government of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat.
      (Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.18 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Periodic inspections during the installation of improvements shall be made
by the City to ensure conformity with the approved plans and specifications as
required by these Regulations.
   The subdivider shall notify proper City officials at least 24 hours before
each phase of the improvements is ready for inspection. The presence and/or
absence of an inspector during construction shall not relieve the subdivider
from full responsibility of required improvements to the City of Urbana
Construction Standards and Drawings and to the satisfaction of the City. See
City of Urbana Design Criteria for inspection requirements. The City may
require improvement inspection fees (see City for Schedule of Fees).
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.19 MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS AND MAINTENANCE SURETY.
   The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements, if required,
until approval of said improvements. Once the required public improvements have
been constructed and approved in the subdivision by the City Administrator, and
prior to the release of the performance surety, the subdivider shall post with
the City a maintenance surety in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the
performance surety and in a form as approved by the City Law Director.
   No public improvements shall be approved until the subdivider has posted an
approved maintenance surety, and this maintenance surety will extend for one
(1) year from the actual date that the final punch list has been completed and
approved by the City.
   Acceptance by the City of the public improvements will not take place until
the City releases the maintenance surety and the City receives record drawings
as outlined in the City of Urbana Design Criteria. Record drawings shall be
stamped by a registered professional engineer or surveyor verifying the
accuracy of the drawings.
   Prior to release of the maintenance surety by the City, the developer shall
have paid all public improvement fees required by these Regulations and have
completed all maintenance punch list items. (Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.20 DEFERRAL OR WAIVER OF REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of final approval,
subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all such
improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, public safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to defer the
construction of any improvement required herein because of incompatible grades,
future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for other
reasons, the applicant shall pay his share of the costs of the future
improvements as approved by the City Engineer and City Council to the City
prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.21 PROCEDURE IN CASE OF FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENT.
   The subdivider shall be in default of this performance surety when one of
the following conditions exist:
   (a)   The installation of all required public improvements as called for in
these Regulations has not taken within the two (2) year time period agreed upon
in the subdivider’s contract with the City, and the subdivider has failed to
establish reasonable cause for such delay to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission and thereby to receive a time extension.
   (b)   The subdivider has not constructed the required public improvements in
accordance with the minimum standards specified in these Regulations, and the
subdivider is unwilling to modify and to upgrade said public improvements
within a six (6) month time period so as to be in compliance with the
provisions of these Regulations.
      (Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.22 PROCEDURE IN CASE OF DEFAULT.
   The subdivider shall be in default of his maintenance surety when the
required public improvements have not been properly maintained over the one (1)
year period as established in Section
1161.17 Improvements and Performance Surety or when the required public
improvements are not in accordance with the “as-built” plans submitted by the
subdivider to the City. The same shall apply whenever construction of
improvements is not performed in accordance with applicable standards and
specifications. In such cases of default, the City of Urbana shall proceed to
utilize the performance surety and/or maintenance surety to construct the
required public improvements to the minimum design standards as required in
these Regulations.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.23 ISSUANCE OF ZONING PERMITS.
   As determined by the City Administrator, Zoning Permits will be issued when
the extent of the street improvements is completed with curb and asphalt being
installed. However, the subdivider is responsible for any damage to
improvements.

REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION
IMPROVEMENTS AND DESIGN
1161.24 GENERAL STATEMENT.
   The Regulations contained in this section and the City of Urbana Design
Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings shall control the manner in
which streets, lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the
land. These design controls shall help ensure convenient and safe streets,
creation of usable lots, provision of space for public utilities, and
reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and
functional neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features
of unplanned, haphazard growth.
   The Planning Commission has the responsibility of reviewing the design of
each future subdivision early in its design development. The Planning
Commission shall ensure that all the requirements of this section and the City
of Urbana Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings are met.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.25 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangements, character, width, and location of all arterial and
collector thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the adopted
City of Urbana Major Thoroughfare Plan and Corridor Overlay Plan. Thoroughfares
not contained in the aforementioned plan shall conform to the recommendation of
the Planning Commission, based upon these Regulations. In addition, no final
plat shall be approved if in conflict with an existing ordinance.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.26 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   The arrangements, character, extent, width, grade, construction, and
location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan of
the City, and shall conform to the City of Urbana Design Criteria and
Construction Standards and Drawings. Street design shall take into
consideration their relationship to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions, and public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. The street
pattern shall discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The
subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the plat, the necessary
right-of-way for the widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in
conformity with the Comprehensive Development Plan.
   The subdivider shall improve all streets that are part of the subdivision,
including that portion of the subdivision located on existing streets. The
required improvements shall be such that all items of work are in accordance
with the City of Urbana Design Criteria and Construction Standards and
Drawings. Existing streets shall be improved so that they meet the above
standards including storm drainage.
   Curbs and gutters shall be required for all streets including existing
streets.
   If one side of the subdivision abuts an existing street, the developer shall
pay for the total cost of one side for additional width of excavation, curb and
sidewalk including cost to bring the storm sewer system up to standards.
   Appropriate access to and from any subdivision in the form of a standard
City street with required improvements must be provided by a developer in
instances where development is not located contiguously along an improved
public street right-of-way. No subdivision shall be approved where a parcel,
tract, or lot has frontage only on the “stub end” of a discontinued or dead-end
street. Such street must first be extended or reconstructed as a cul-de-sac in
accordance with these Regulations. No subdivision showing reserved strips
controlling the access to public ways will be approved.
   All street widths shall conform to the City of Urbana Design Criteria and
Construction Standards and Drawings. In cases where the designation of the
street is in question, the Planning Commission shall determine the type of
street designation.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.27 STREET SIGNS AND STREET NAMES.
   (a)   Street name signs and other traffic control signs shall be furnished
and erected by the subdivider according to standards set forth by the City of
Urbana Design Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings.
   (b)   For purposes of street naming, the following is recommended:
      (1)   Circle, Place, or Court should be used only for cul-de-sac type
streets.
      (2)   The words north, south, east, or west should be avoided as part of
a street name whenever possible.
   (c)   Whenever a new street is constructed along the approximate alignment
or extension of an existing street, its name shall be the same as that of the
existing one.
   (d)   To avoid duplication and confusion, the proposed names of all streets
shall be approved by the Planning Commission prior to such names being assigned
or used.
   
   (e)   House numbers shall be assigned by the Engineering Department in
accordance with the current house numbering system in effect in the City.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.28 SPECIAL STREET TYPES.
   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing street plan and only if
a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the City Engineer in design is provided.
   Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a dedicated or
platted half- street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided, the other
half shall be platted.
   Alleys may be permitted in new residential, commercial, and industrial
districts. Alleys shall conform to these Regulations, and according to
standards set forth by the City of Urbana Design Criteria and Construction
Standards and Drawings.
   Cul-de-Sac Streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length and shall conform to
these Regulations according to standards set forth by the City of Urbana Design
Criteria and Construction Standards and Drawings.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1161.29 STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Streets serving commercial developments and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with arterial streets or marginal access drives so as not to
generate traffic problems. The intersections of driveways from parking areas
with arterial or collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least

actively removes the soil from this narrow area to considerable depths such
that the channel would not be obliterated by normal smoothing or tillage
operations.
      (4)   Natural erosion (geological erosion): Wearing away of the earth’s
surface by water, ice, or other natural environmental conditions of climate,
vegetation, etc., undisturbed by man.

1163.06 ROADWAYS.
   All street design and layout shall follow the City of Urbana Construction
Standards and Drawings; ODOT Location and Design Manual, Volume One, Roadway
Design, latest version; and AASHTO. The most restrictive shall apply as
determined by the City Engineer. These criteria cover design factors and
provide guidelines for evaluations of plans and specifications by the political
subdivisions having jurisdiction over the review of the plans and
specifications. The design shall be consistent with the requirements of AASHTO
and ODOT.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1163.07 STORM DRAINAGE.
   (a)   General Provisions. The following Design Criteria are summarized
herein to establish practical uniform design of storm sewers for the City.
These criteria cover design factors and provide guidelines for evaluation of
plans and specifications by the political subdivisions having jurisdiction over
the review of plans and specifications. These Design Criteria are also intended
to conform to the standard drawings for storm sewers. Storm sewer design should
follow these criteria and Ohio Department of Transportation Location and
Design, Volume Two, Drainage Design.
   (b)   Storm Sewer and Inlet Grate Design. An adequate storm drainage system
shall be constructed for all proposed developments. Natural drainage areas
should be closely followed.
   Outlets for the storm water runoff for development upstream of the proposed
development must be provided. All storm sewer calculations must be submitted to
the City before any approvals will be given.
   Storm runoff from urban areas may constitute a large volume of flow. The
rational method is the preferred method for estimating storm runoff for areas
less than or equal to 100 acres. Once the runoff is determined, the Manning
Formula is the preferred method to calculate the capacity of the storm sewer
pipes. Storm sewer shall be designed based on the full flow capacity of all
pipes being able to carry at least the runoff from a 5-year storm event.
   Also, the Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL) should be checked to ensure that a 25-
year storm event will not cause ponding water at catch basins and manholes.
   The Rational Formula used to compute the runoff that reaches a storm sewer
inlet consists of the following:
Q = CiA
Q = Peak rate of runoff in cubic feet per second (cfs)
C = A coefficient expressing the ratio of runoff to the average rainfall rate
during the time of concentration
i = Intensity of rainfall, in inches per hour
A = Drainage area, in acres
   Other methods for determination of peak runoff rates may be used upon
approval from or by request of the City.

This can be used to determine values of “I” for several storm frequencies.
The Manning Formula, used to compute flow in open conduits, consists of the
following:
 
Q = 1.486 R 2/3 S 1/2 A
n
Q = Flow in cubic feet per second (cfs)
n = Coefficient of conduit roughness (n = 0.013)
R = Hydraulic radius, ratio of flow area to wetted perimeter in feet
S = Channel or pipe slope, in feet per feet
A = Area of Cross-section of flow in square feet
The design of storm sewers in the City of Urbana shall be outlined as follows.
   (a)   Prepare a contour map of the drainage area including the surrounding
area, drainage limits, and direction of surface flow.
   (b)   Divide the area into the subareas tributary to the proposed sewer
inlets. These inlets should be located at reversals of road grade from negative
to positive and at street intersections. A maximum distance of 300 feet between
catch basins will be allowed along long street grades.
   (c)   Determine the acreage and imperviousness of each area.
   (d)   Calculate the required capacity of each inlet using the appropriate
time of concentration, the tributary area and the rational method.
   (e)   Beginning at the highest elevation, compute the flow to be carried by
each line. The time of concentration for each line other than the first in a
series is the sum of the time of concentration to the inlet next upstream and
the flow time in the connecting pipe. Where more than two lines meet, the time
of concentration to be used for the succeeding line is the longest time in the
lines meeting. Each line will thus require calculation of time of
concentration, tributary area (all upstream areas), and flow.
   (f)   Select tentative pipe sizes and grades using the Manning Formula. Each
line must be selected in order since the time of concentration for subsequent
lines will be dependent upon the time of flow in all upstream lines.
   (g)   Minimum cover requirements specified by ASTM specifications must be
met.
   (h)   Figure 6.4, Computation for Storm Sewer Design, may be used for storm
sewer calculation.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3255.jpg]
   (c)   Minimum Diameter. The minimum diameter of storm sewer pipe shall be 12
inches. The diameter shall be increased as necessary according to the design
analysis.
   (d)   Minimum Cover. The minimum cover over storm sewer pipe shall be 2 feet
unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. Cover is measured from the top
of pipe to the finished grade directly above the pipe.
   (e)   Minimum Slope.  The minimum recommended slope for storm sewers shall
be 0.10 foot per 100 feet, unless a greater slope is required to obtain the
minimum mean velocity. Culverts may be installed on flatter grades as approved
by the City Engineer.
   (f)   Minimum Velocity. The absolute minimum mean velocity for all storm
sewers shall be 2.0 feet per second when flowing full based on Manning’s
Formula using an “n” value of 0.013. Use of other ”n” values will be considered
if deemed justifiable on the basis of extensive field data. The desirable
minimum velocity is 3.0 feet per second based on the same criteria.
   (g)   Maximum Velocity. The maximum velocity of all storm sewers shall be 10
feet per second. If the velocity is greater than 10 feet per second, provisions
should be made to protect against displacement and erosion of the pipe.
   (h)   Maximum Headwater.  The maximum allowable headwater depth for culverts
shall be 2 feet below pavement surfaces and/or finish floor elevations.
   (i)   Manholes.  Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line, at all
changes in grade, size, alignment, and at all pipe intersections. Manholes
shall be installed at distances not greater than 400 feet. Intervals of more
than 400 feet may be approved in sewers 42 inches and larger. Manholes may be
either poured in place or precast concrete. Concrete construction shall conform
to ASTM C-478.
   The flow channel through manholes should be made to conform in shape, slope,
and smoothness to that of the sewers.
   All manhole covers shall be adjusted to grade by the use of no more than 12
inches of precast adjusting collars.
   Manholes shall be consistent with those shown in the standard drawings.
   (j)   Manhole Minimum Diameter. Manholes shall be constructed large enough
to allow access to all sewers. The minimum diameter of manholes shall be 48
inches. Where large sewers require the use of manholes diameters greater than
48 inches, the manhole shall be returned to the 48-inch diameter as soon as
practical above the sewer crown. Manhole openings of 24 inches or larger are
recommended for easy access with safety equipment and to facilitate
maintenance.
   (k)   Catch Basins. Curb inlets shall be placed at all low points, points of
change to a flatter street grade, the dead end of descending streets, and at
the Point of Curvature and Point of Tangency of all intersection radius curves
where the street grade descends toward the radius curve and at all
intersections. The basis for the design and spacing of curb inlets shall
conform to the Bureau of Roads Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 12, “Drainage
of Highway Pavements”.
   Under normal conditions, curb inlets shall be placed on both sides of the
street at intervals indicated by the street grade. Approximate spacing ranges
from 150 feet to 300 feet maximum under normal conditions for the spread of
flow-in gutters.
   Catch basins not placed in the street shall be selected and placed so that
they blend with the surroundings and not appear unsightly.
   Curb inlets shall be placed on the property lines if at all possible.
   Catch basin types shall be consistent with the types shown in the standard
drawings.
   (l)   Basis of Culvert Design. The basis of design for highway culverts
shall be the Bureau of Roads Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 5, “Hydraulic
Charts for the Selection of Highway Culverts”. Design shall be based on a 25-
year storm for full flow capacity and an overtopping capacity of at least a
100-year storm.
   (m)   Open Drainage Ditches.  The basis of design for drainage ditches shall
be the Manning Formula, as defined in Section
1163.02 . Figure 6.2 may be used to determine the value of “n”, Manning’s
Roughness Coefficient, to be used in the calculations. These calculations of
open ditch capacity should be provided to the reviewing agency along with the
construction drawings.

   (n)   Channel Protection.  Channel protection material shall be placed at
pipe outlets and other areas of high velocity flow to prevent erosion. The
type, location and depth of the protective material shall be reviewed and
approved by the City.
   (o)   Storm Water Detention Basin/Retention Pond Size Requirements.
      (1)   It is recognized that the outlets for storm water runoff in the
City are very limited. These outlets do not have the capacity to receive and
convey the increased runoff resulting from rapid development around the City.
      (2)   Developer/Owners must participate in providing detention storage to
eliminate the excessive runoff during heavy storm periods. Where impervious
areas are planned or contemplated, it is the intent that detention be provided
as required by the provisions hereinafter set forth. It is proposed that well
maintained landscaped areas would be provided to act jointly as detention
reservoirs and recreation facilities as aesthetic focal points in new
developments. Other control methods to regulate the rate of storm water
discharge which may be acceptable, include detention on parking lots, streets,
lawns, underground storage, oversized storm sewers with restricted outlets,
etc. However, these methods must be approved by City officials.
      (3)   It is recognized that in order to better serve the long-range
interests of the City and the surrounding area, comprehensive basin-wide
planning for runoff control should be formulated, adopted, and implemented.
Comprehensive planning is far more beneficial than small, on-site detention
areas, although on-site detention does provide protection and is acceptable for
compliance.
      (4)   Detention of storm water shall be required for all developments and
proposed development which would alter storm runoff as to flow, velocity or
time of concentration. These basins are required to detain the peak post-
developed runoff which exceeds the runoff created by a 5-year storm under
predeveloped condition. The City reserves the option to require more stringent
detention requirements based upon the estimated capacity of the existing storm
sewers. All calculations must be submitted to the City for approval.
Calculations must include a profile of the existing storm sewer from the
proposed connection point to a point 500 feet downstream or the first outfall
structure nearest to or beyond the required 500 feet. The calculated full flow
capacity of the existing storm water outfall shall also be provided.
      (5)   Design of storm water detention facilities shall be based on the
following:
         A.   The City suggests that runoffs and capacities are to be computed
using the Rational Method and Manning Formula as determined in Section
1163.07(b) and Table 6.2 of Section
1163.07 of this document for areas less than 200 acres.
         B.   The release rate shall not be greater than the storm runoff
created by the pre-developed site during a five-year frequency storm. The
allowable outflow rate used in Figure 6.5 “Computation Worksheet for Detention
Storage Using Rational Method” is derived using a C coefficient of 0.2 and a
rainfall intensity of 3.81 inches based on 5 years with a duration of 15
minutes. Consideration may be given for different intensity and coefficient
based on the situation.
         C.   Storage volume shall not be less than the storm runoff created by
the post-developed site during a 100-year storm event. The storage volume may
be computed by using Figure 6.5, “Computation Worksheet for Detention Storage
Using Rational Method”.
The percentage of impervious area is used to calculate detention required.
Generally 30% may be used for single- family residences, 50% for multi-family
residences, 70% for industrial sites, and 90% for commercial property. If
another percentage would be more appropriate for the individual site, the more
appropriate number should be used.
The Runoff Coefficient C for various storm durations is given in Table 6.4 for
each land use.

         D.   Outlet size shall be determined by using the orifice equation as
defined by:
Q = CA 2gH
               C = 0.6
               A = Area in square feet
               g = 32.2 ft./s2
H = height from the center of the pipe to the top of the water surface
         E.   Special detention consideration may be given by the City
Engineering Department for high impervious areas that are smaller than 2 acres
in size.
An emergency overflow from the basin to a major storm system must be provided
to protect the facility and adjacent properties. The designer should
investigate the capacity of the downstream drainage facilities to determine if
they will be adequate to handle the design flow from this particular
development. If the downstream facilities are inadequate, it may be necessary
to provide on-site retention or ponding basins to limit the flow to an amount
which the downstream system can accept.

   (p)   Detention Basin/Retention Pond Standards.
      (1)   Standards for dry detention basins.
         A.   Where water quality during dry weather periods in a small basin
would be a potential problem due to lack of adequate dry weather flow, direct
pollution from surface water runoff, or high nutrients in the flow; the basin
should be designed to remain dry except when in flood use.
         B.   Dry detention basins shall be designed to minimize the wetness of
the bottom so that water does not remain standing in the bottom; thereby
harboring insects and limiting the potential use of the basin. This shall be
accomplished by means of a concrete low flow channel between inlet and outlet
structures. Minimum slope shall be no less than 0.4 percent. A possible
alternative upon City approval to a concrete low flow channel would be an
underdrain. In this case, a minimum of 1 percent slope shall exist between
inlet and outlet structures and the surface above the underdrain shall be grass
sod.
         C.   The detention basin should be designed to have a multi-purpose
function. Recreational facilities, aesthetic qualities, etc,. as well as flood
water storage should be considered in planning the basin.
         D.   Side slopes shall be 3 to 1 or flatter.
         E.   There shall be a minimum of a 3-foot berm at 2 percent between
right-of-way and top basin slopes.
      (2)   Standards for basins containing permanent water.
         A.   In order to provide better management for water quality,
retention basins containing permanent lakes should have a water area of at
least one-half acre. The lake area should be an average depth of 5 feet to
inhibit weed and insect growth, and should have no extensive shallow areas. A
system to augment storm flows into the lake with water from other sources
should be provided to enhance the water quality, if necessary. These systems
would include the use of public water supplies or wells on site.
         B.   In excavated lakes, the underwater side slopes in the lake should
be stable.
         C.   A safety ledge 4 to 6 feet in width is recommended and should be
installed in all lakes approximately 18 to 24 inches below the permanent water
level to provide a footing if people fall into the water. In addition, there
shall be a minimum of a 5-foot berm at 2 percent slope beginning at least 1
foot above normal pond elevation. The slope between two ledges should be stable
and of a material which will prevent erosion due to wave action (see Figure
6.6). Walkways consisting of a non-erosive material should be provided in areas
where extensive population use tramples growth. One area in particular would be
along the shoreline of a heavily fished lake. Side slopes above the berm shall
be 3 to 1 or flatter.
         D.   Side slopes of the pool shall be 2 to 1 or flatter.
         E.   To obtain additional recreational benefits from developed water
areas and provide for insect control, ponds may be stocked with fish. For best
results, stocking should follow recommendations for warm water sport fishing by
the Ohio Department of Conservation, Division of Fisheries, or similar
organizations.
         F.   Periodic maintenance will be required in lakes to control weed
and larval growth. The basin should also be designed to provide for the easy
removal of sediment which will accumulate in the lake during periods of basin
operation. A means of maintaining the designed water level of the lake during
prolonged periods of dry weather is also recommended. One suggested method is
to have a water hydrant near the pond site.
         G.   No rubble or construction refuse shall be disposed of at any
time.
         H.   No pond with a permanent water elevation shall be placed within
one mile of a runway approach or landing approach to an airport.
      (3)   Standards common to either dry detention basins or retention basins
with permanent water.
         A.   A 20-foot-wide City easement shall be provided for access to all
storm water storage ponds.
         B.   All basins shall have an emergency overflow.
         C.   All excavated spoils should be spread so as to provide for
aesthetic and recreational features such as sledding hills, sports fields, etc.
Slopes of 4 horizontal to 1 vertical are recommended except where recreation
uses call for steeper slopes. Even these features should have a slope no
greater than 3 horizontal to 12 vertical for safety, minimal erosion,
stability, and ease of maintenance.
         D.   When conduits are used for the outlet of the reservoir, they
shall be protected by bar screens as approved by the City or other suitable
provisions so that debris or similar trash will not interfere with the
operation of the basin.
         E.   Safety screens should also be provided for any pipe or opening to
prevent children or large animals from crawling into the structures. For
safety, a suggested maximum opening is 6 inches.
         F.   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover should be maintained
throughout the entire reservoir area. Grass should be cut regularly no less
than five times a year.
         G.   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance should
be performed after each storm to assure continued operation in conformance to
the design.
      (4)   Inspection of basins.
         A.   Record drawings will be required for all basins to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements.
         B.   The City may inspect all private detention basins and if problems
exist, report these to the owner. The owner shall be given a reasonable amount
of time to correct the problem, weather permitting.
         C.   The City shall perform such work as it deems necessary and charge
owner if the owner fails to correct the problem.
      (5)   Detention basin ownership.  Detention basin maintenance and
ownership shall remain private unless the City accepts ownership through
approval by the City Council.

   (q)   Site Grading.
      (1)   Site grading plan. Site grading plans shall be prepared with 1 foot
existing and proposed contours showing all lots or lots having proper drainage.
Site grading plans for developments shall also have proposed building pad
elevations to ensure proper drainage of the development. Individual site plans
within a development must conform to the subdivision drainage site plan.
      (2)   Cuts and fills. No land shall be graded, cut, or filled so as to
create a slope exceeding a vertical rise of 1 foot for each 3 feet of
horizontal distance between abutting lots, unless a retaining wall of
sufficient height and thickness is provided to retain the graded bank. Major
cuts, excavation, grading, and filling, where the same material changes the
site and its relationship with surrounding areas, shall not be permitted as
such excavation, grading, and filling will result in a slope exceeding a
vertical rise of 1 foot for each 3 feet of horizontal distance between abutting
lots or between adjoining tracts of land, except where adequate provision is
made to prevent slides and erosion by cribbing and retaining walls.
      (3)   Compaction of fill. All fill shall be compacted to a density of 90%
or greater. Inspection of fill shall be conducted by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Retaining walls.  Retaining walls may be required whenever
topographic conditions warrant or where necessary to retain fill or cut slopes
within the right-of-way. Such improvements shall require the approval of the
City Engineer.
      (5)   Filling of existing areas.  No existing area shall be filled or
graded to adversely affect adjoining properties as determined by the City
Engineer.
 
   (r)   Responsibility for Maintenance of Private Storm Water Facilities and
Drainage on Private Property.
      (1)   Any owner or possessor of private property upon which storm water
drainage facilities, whether man-made or natural, exist for the purpose of
collecting, conveying, retaining, or detaining storm water within that property
and which are not public facilities, shall be responsible for the maintenance
of these facilities to ensure proper operation.
      (2)   The City shall not be responsible for resolving drainage problems
on private property where such problems pose a nuisance, do not impact the
operation of the overall storm water management system of the City, or do not
involve the function of public facilities. Private property owners bear the
responsibility to remedy these types of problems.
      (3)   The City may cooperate with private property owners to extend
public facilities of the storm water management system to the private property,
to enable the resolution of these drainage problems if the City Council decides
that suitable resources are available, the project can be accommodated within
the context of the City’s overall Capital Improvement Plan, and the City
Engineer determines that the City’s storm water management system is capable of
handling any additional flows that may be placed in the system as a result of
implementing the proposed solution.
   (s)   Runoff from Upstream Drainage Areas. The runoff from drainage areas
upstream of the proposed development or improvement must be provided with an
unobstructed outlet and an emergency overflow. The outlet should provide the
capacity needed to carry the runoff from a 5-year storm in its existing land
use condition.
 
   (t)   Runoff onto Contiguous Properties. All site drainage shall be
contained on-site. No land altering activity shall disperse runoff into areas
adjacent to the area experiencing development.
 
   (u)   Soil Sediment Pollution Control Regulations.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the regulation is to prevent the undue
polluting of public waters by sediment from accelerated soil erosion and
accelerated storm water runoff caused by earth-disturbing urban areas. Control
of such pollution will promote and maintain the health, safety and general
well- being of all life and inhabitants herein the City.
      (2)   Scope. This shall apply to earth-disturbing activities on areas of
land used or being developed for commercial, industrial, residential,
recreational, public service or other non-farm purposes which are within the
City unless otherwise excluded within or unless expressly excluded by state
law.
      (3)   Disclaimer of liability. Neither submission of a plan under
provisions of this article nor compliance with provisions of these regulations
shall relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any person or
property otherwise imposed by law, nor imposed any liability upon the City or
its appointed representative for damage to any person or property.
      (4)   Severability.  If any clause, section, or provision of this chapter
is declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
validity of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
      (5)   Requirements. No person shall cause or allow earth-disturbing
activities on a development area except in compliance with the standards and
criteria and the applicable item listed below:
         A.   When a proposed development area consists of five (5) or more
acres and earth-disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or any
part thereof, the responsible person shall develop and submit for approval a
sediment control plan prior to any earth-disturbing activity. Such a plan must
contain sediment pollution control practices so that compliance with other
provisions of this chapter will be achieved during and after development. Such
a plan shall include specific requirements established by regulation.
         B.   When a proposed development area involves less than five (5)
acres, it is not necessary to submit a sediment control plan; however, the
responsible person must comply with the other provisions of these regulations.
All earth-disturbing activities shall be subject to surveillance and site
investigation to determine compliance with the standards and regulations.
      (6)   Standards and criteria.  In order to control sediment pollution of
water resources, the owner or person responsible for the development area shall
use conservation planning and practices to maintain the level of conservation
established by one or more of the following standards:
         A.   Timing of Sediment-Trapping Practices - Sediment control
practices shall be functional throughout earth-disturbing activity. Settling
facilities, perimeter controls, and other practices intended to trap sediment
shall be implemented as the first step of grading and within seven (7) days
from the start of earth disturbing activities. They shall continue to function
until the upslope developed area is restabilized.
         B.   Stabilization of Denuded Areas - Denuded areas shall have soil
stabilization applied within seven (7) days if they are to remain dormant for
more than forty-five (45) days. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall
be applied to denuded areas within seven (7) days after final grade is reached
on any portion of the site, and shall also be applied within seven (7) days to
denuded areas which may not be final grade, but will remain dormant
(undisturbed) for longer than forty-five (45) days.
         C.   Settling Facilities - Concentrated storm water runoff from
denuded areas shall pass through a sediment-settling facility. The facility’s
storage capacity shall be 67 cubic yards per acre of drainage area.
         D.   Sediment Barriers - Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
filtered or diverted to a settling facility. Sediment barriers such as sediment
fence or diversions to settling facilities shall protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported by sheet flow.
         E.   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection - All storm sewer inlets which
accept water runoff from the development shall be protected so that sediment-
laden water from soils that are not permanently stabilized will not enter the
storm sewer system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove
sediment, unless the storm sewer system drains to a settling facility.
         F.   Working in Crossing Streams.
            1.   Streams including bed and banks shall be restabilized
immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or stopped. To the
extent practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams. Where
in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work
area during construction to minimize erosion.
            2.   If a live (wet) stream must be crossed by construction
vehicles regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be
provided.
         G.   Construction Access Routes - Measures shall be taken to prevent
soil transport onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls,
or onto public roads.
         H.   Sloughing and Dumping.
            1.   No soil, rock, debris or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping, or placing is
authorized by the approving agency, and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, for such purposes, including but not limited to, constructing
bridges, culverts, and erosion control structures.
            2.   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
done in accordance with a qualified professional engineer’s recommendations to
correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
         I.   Cut and Fill Slopes - Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner which will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be
given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, upslope drainage
area, groundwater conditions, and slope stabilization.
         J.   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels - Outfalls and constructed
or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the
expected velocity of flow from a post-development, 10-year frequency storm.
         K.   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation - A permanent vegetative
cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently
stabilized.
         L.   Disposition of Temporary Practices - All temporary erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days after
final site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no
longer needed, unless otherwise authorized by the approving agency. Trapped
sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion.
         M.   Maintenance - All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment
control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance
requirements. They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure
continued performance of their intended function. The person or entity
responsible for the continued maintenance of permanent erosion controls shall
be identified to the satisfaction of the approving agency.
            The standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the approving agency to impose additional, more stringent requirements, nor
shall the standards limit the right of the approving agency to waive individual
requirements.
         Erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy the standards
shall meet the specifications in the current edition of water management and
sediment control for urbanizing areas (Soil Conservation Service, Ohio).
      (7)   Maintenance. The property owner shall assume responsibility for
maintenance of structures and other facilities designed to control erosion.
 
   (v)   Railroad and Highway Crossing.  When boring is required, the casing
pipe shall be designed to meet the requirements of the authority having
jurisdiction and in compliance with the City of Urbana Construction Standards
and Drawings. The size of the casing pipe shall be at least 4 inches greater
than the largest outside diameter of the sewer pipe, joints, or couplings.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1163.08 WATER DISTRIBUTION.
   (a)   General Provisions. The following Design Criteria are summarized
herein to establish practical, uniform design of water distribution systems for
the City. These criteria cover design factors and provides guidelines for
evaluation of plans and specifications by the political subdivision having
jurisdiction over the review of plans and specifications. These Design Criteria
are also intended to conform to the construction standards and drawings for
water systems and the regulations of the OEPA.
 
   (b)   Basis of Design.  The basis of design for water distribution systems
shall be the Hazen-Williams Equation, an empirical formula for estimating pipe
flow:
V = 1.318CR 0.63 S 0.54
   V = Velocity in feet per second
   C = Roughness Coefficient
   R = Hydraulic Radius (pipe diameter in feet for pipes flowing full) in feet
   S = Head loss per unit length of pipe
   Distribution systems shall be designed for the estimated maximum day rate of
flow, or the fire flow plus the estimated average day rate of flow, whichever
is more demanding.
   (c)   Minimum Pressure.  The minimum allowable pressure in the water
distribution system, at times of no fires, shall be 50 pounds per square inch
in all mains. The minimum fire flow for design purposes shall be 600 gallons
per minute at a residual pressure of 20 pounds per square inch.
   (d)   Maximum Velocity. The maximum velocity of the water in the system
shall be 10 feet per second.
   (e)   Water Mains. The value of C to be used in the Hazen-Williams Equation
shall be C=140. The minimum size of water mains shall be 8 inches in diameter.
Dead-ending mains shall be minimized by looping of all mains. Where dead-ends
occur, they should be provided with a fire hydrant for flushing purposes.
   The minimum depth of water mains shall be 4 feet 6 inches from the top of
the pipe to the finished grade elevation. The maximum depth of water mains
shall be 5 feet and 6 inches from the top of the main to the finished grade
elevation, except where utilities must be underpassed or as directed by the
City.
   (f)   Water Service Lines.  The value of C to be used in the Hazen-Williams
Equation shall be C = 130. The minimum diameter of service lines shall be 3/
4 inch, unless the distance from the main to the meter exceeds 120 feet, where
the minimum service line diameter shall be 1 inch. Table 8.1 lists required
minimum service sizes as determined by residential population. Fire hydrant
services shall have a minimum diameter of 6 inches, but shall be no larger than
the water main. For services larger than 2 inches, a tapping sleeve and valve
must be installed. Table 8.2 shows the maximum size of service taps allowed for
various sizes of water mains.

shall be 5 feet from the top of the line to the finished grade elevation,
except where utilities must be underpassed.
   A curb stop and curb box shall be installed between the curb and sidewalk or
between the walk and right-of-way line where there is not a curb lawn for each
house and apartment unit unless otherwise approved the City. The curb stop box
shall be plumbed and centered over the curb stop and shall be free of debris.
House service installations shall conform to the Standard Drawings.
   (g)   Restraining and Concrete Blocking for Water Mains. All water main
bends of more than 5 degrees shall be securely blocked against movement by
using concrete blocking placed against undisturbed earth. Dimensions and
quantities of blocking shall be as shown on the Standard Drawings. All
mechanical bends, tees, etc. shall be restrained using mechanical restraining
joints.
   (h)   Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be placed at all intersections and
never more than 400 feet apart in Residential areas, and no more than 300 feet
apart in Industrial or Commercial areas.
   Fire hydrants shall be installed with a break flange located approximately 2
inches above the ground level to protect against flooding in case of impact to
hydrant. Fire hydrants shall be consistent with the Standard Drawings.
   A valve must be installed on all fire hydrant service lines. All connections
between the main and the hydrant shall be restrained by anchoring pipe, tie
bolts, or retainer glands.
   (i)   Meter Installation.  Meter installation for individual services shall
be consistent with the Standard Drawings. Table 8.3 lists required meter sizes
as determined by Maximum Flow Demand for Commercial-Industrial applications.
Meters must be installed prior to connecting the service to the main and before
service starts. No common meters will be approved. All meters must have remote
readers.

   (j)   Valves.  Valves shall be located at all branches of cross and tee
intersections and at intervals not to exceed 800 feet in residential districts
and 500 feet in commercial and industrial districts.
   (k)   Backflow Prevention. All commercial, industrial, and other OEPA
required users shall provide adequate backflow prevention between the public
water system and the customer’s system. These devices shall be approved by OEPA
and the City prior to installation. These devices shall be tested and inspected
annually. These devices shall be repaired or replaced if they do not meet the
testing requirements. An annual report shall be submitted to the City detailing
the testing procedures and results. Backflow devices shall be reduced pressure-
zone type.
   (l)   Railroad and Highway Crossings. When boring is required, the casing
pipe shall be designed to meet the requirements of the authority having
jurisdiction and in compliance with the City of Urbana Construction Standards
and Drawings. The size of the casing pipe shall be at least 4 inches greater
than the largest outside diameter of the sewer pipe, joints, or couplings.
(Ord. 4206. Passed 1-24-06.)
1163.09 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   General Provisions. The following Design Criteria are summarized
herein to establish practical, uniform design of sanitary sewers within the
City. These criteria cover design factors and approved guidelines for
evaluation of plans and specifications by the political subdivisions having
jurisdiction over the review of plans and specifications. These design factors
are consistent with the requirements of the OEPA. If these Design Criteria
should conflict in the future with the requirements of the OEPA, these criteria
shall be modified to conform to their requirements. These Design Criteria are
also intended to conform to the City Standard Drawings for sanitary sewers.
   (b)   Basis of Design. The basis of design shall be the Manning Formula.
This is used to calculate the capacity of a pipe flowing full:
 
Q= 1.486  R2/3 S1/2 A
   n
   Q = Flow in cfs
   A = Area of cross section - square feet
   n = Coefficient of roughness (n = 0.013)
   R = Hydraulic Radius - feet
   S = Slope in ft/ft
   (c)   Maximum Depth of Flow. Recommended design practices limit the depth of
flow in a sanitary sewer. The maximum depth of flow should be equal to or less
than 0.8 of the diameter of the pipe.
   (d)   Average Daily Flow. The average daily flow shall be 100 gallons per
capita per day and includes normal infiltration.
   (e)   Population Density. The average household consists of 4 persons.
Therefore, for design purposes, there would be 4 capita per equivalent single-
family dwelling.
   (f)   Peak Design Flow.  Sanitary sewers shall be designed on a peak design
flow basis using one of the following methods:
      (1)   The ratio of peak average flow (ADF).
      (2)   Values established from the infiltration/inflow study approved by
the OEPA.
      (3)   Values obtained from the flow records of a similar facility over a
period of time sufficient to establish with a reasonable degree of reliability
the relationship between average dry weather flow and peak design flow.
      (4)   Peak flows as determined by the Great Lakes Upper Mississippi River
Board (GLUMRB) (Ten States Standards), latest version.
   Use of other values for peak design flow will be considered, if justified,
on the basis of extensive documentation.

   (g)   Minimum Velocity.  All sanitary sewers shall be designed to give a
mean velocity of at least 2.0 feet per second, when flowing full, based on
Manning’s Formula using an “n” value of 0.013. Use of other “n” values will be
considered, if deemed justifiable, on the basis of extensive field data.
   (h)   Maximum Velocity. The maximum velocity shall be 15 feet per second. If
the velocity is greater than 15 feet per second, provisions should be made to
protect against displacement.
   (i)   Minimum Grades. All sanitary sewers shall be designed to give a mean
velocity of at least 2.0 feet per second when flowing full based on Manning’s
Formula. Values of “n” to be used with the Manning Formula vary from 0.010 to
0.015 with 0.013 recommended. Use of “n” values other than 0.013 may be
considered, if justified. Use of formulas other than Manning’s Formula may be
accepted. If plans are recommended for approval with a slope less than the
minimum, the consulting Engineer must show justification for the recommendation
and obtain approval from OEPA. See Table 9.1.

   (j)   Sanitary Sewers.  In general, the minimum size of sanitary sewers
shall be 8 inches. However, 6-inch sanitary sewers may be used as private
lateral sewers for apartments, camps, schools, restaurants, and other semi-
public operations, provided their hydraulic capacity is not exceeded because of
short run-off periods (high peak flows).
   The lateral connections shall be premium joint construction and should be
made of the same material as the street sewer whenever possible to minimize
infiltration from the connection between the street main and house lateral.
When joint material and/or dimensions are not compatible, a commercial adapter
shall be provided.
   (k)   House Laterals. Minimum of 4-inch sewer pipe may be used for house
connections. The cover over the lateral coming out of the house shall be a
minimum 3-foot depth. The house connections shall be of premium joint
construction and made of PVC schedule 40 pipe or SDR 35. Cleanouts are required
outside all structures or units and at property lines. In multi- tenant
buildings, individual services shall be provided to a common pipe, then to the
main. Individual water meters shall be used for separate sanitary sewers. When
joint material and/or dimensions are not compatible, a commercial adapter shall
be provided. A copy of an ordinance or regulation requiring this type of
construction must be on file with OEPA district office or submitted with all
sewer plans to receive approval.
   (l)   Invert Drop in Manhole. When a smaller sewer discharges into a larger
one, the invert of the larger sewer should be lowered sufficiently to maintain
the same energy gradient. An approximate method for securing this result is to
place the 0.8 depth point of both sewers at the same elevation or matching the
top elevation of the pipes. When a larger sewer discharges into a smaller, the
invert of the smaller should not be raised to maintain the same energy
gradient.
   (m)   Illegal Connections. Roof drains, foundation drains, sump pumps, yard
drains, and all other clear water connections to the sanitary sewer are
prohibited.
   There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable
water supply system and a sewer or appurtenances thereto which would permit the
passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
   (n)   Horizontal Separation. If possible, sanitary sewers and sewage force
mains should be laid with at least a 10-foot horizontal separation from any
water main.
   (o)   Vertical Separation.  Sewers (or sewage force main) may be laid closer
than 10 feet to a water main if it is laid in a separate trench and elevation
of the crown of the sewer (or sewer force main) is at least 18 inches below the
bottom of the water main. If it is impossible to maintain the 18-inch vertical
separation when the sewer is laid closer than 10 feet to the water main, the
sanitary sewer should be constructed of (or encased in) water main type
materials which will withstand a 50 psi water pressure test.
   If a sewage force main is laid closer than 10 feet to a water main, in no
case should the sewage force main be laid such that the crown of the sewage
force main is less than 18 inches below the water main.
   (p)   Crossing Utilities. Whenever a sanitary sewer and water main must
cross, the sewer shall be laid at such an elevation that the crown of the sewer
is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main. If it is absolutely
impossible to maintain the 18-inch vertical separation, the sanitary sewer
should be constructed of (or encased in) water main type material which will
withstand a 50-psi water pressure test for a distance of 10 feet on both sides
of the water main.
   Whenever a sewage force main and water main must cross, the sewage force
main shall be at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main.
   (q)   Parallel Installation. Sanitary sewers and manholes should be laid
with at least 10 feet, measured from edge to edge, horizontal separation from
any water main. If separation can not be maintained, the sanitary sewer shall
be constructed to water main standards.
   (r)   Manholes. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; at all
changes in grade, size, and alignment; and at all pipe intersections. Manholes
shall be installed at a distance not greater than 400 feet. Greater spacing may
be allowed in larger sewers and in those carrying a settled effluent.
   Manholes may be either poured in place or pre-cast concrete. Concrete
construction shall conform to ASTM C-478 with joints between sections
conforming to ASTM C-443.
   The flow channel through manholes should be made to conform in shape, slope,
and smoothness to that of the sewers.
   All manhole covers shall be adjusted to grade by the use of no more than 12
inches of pre- cast concrete adjusting collars. In areas outside the pavement,
the manhole casting should be adjusted so that the top is slightly above grade
to prevent the entrance of the surface water.
   (s)   Manhole Minimum Diameter.  Manholes shall be constructed large enough
to allow access to the sewer. The minimum diameter of manholes shall be 48
inches. Where manhole diameters of greater than 48 inches are used to
accommodate the sewer pipes, the manhole shall be returned to 48-inch diameter
as soon as practical above the sewer crown. Manhole openings 24 inches or
larger are required for easier access with safety equipment to facilitate
maintenance.
   (t)   Manhole Water Tightness. Manholes shall be constructed to permit
casting adjustments by use of cast-in-place or pre-cast concrete adjusting
collars not to exceed 12 inches in height. Solid manhole covers shall be used
in all pavement locations. In other areas, the manhole casting shall be
adjusted so the top of the manhole cover is slightly above grade to prevent the
entrance of the surface water. In areas subject to flooding, secured watertight
and solid manhole covers should be used. All manhole covers, seating frames,
and adapter rings shall be machined to a firm and even bearing to provide a
true fit into the frames. Manholes shall be installed with chimney seals and
water tight dishes.
   Inlet and outlet pipes should be joined to the manhole with a gasketed and/
or flexible watertight connection meeting ASTM Specification C-443. Where three
or more manholes in sequence are to be constructed with solid, watertight
covers, adequate ventilation shall be provided.
   (u)   Flow Channel.  The invert of the lowest pipe entering a manhole shall
be at least 3 inches (75 mm) above the top of the base slab so that the sewer
flow channel maybe installed and shaped when channel is not precast. The flow
channel through the manholes should be made to conform in shape, slope, and
smoothness to that of the sewers.
   Cut pipe shall not extend beyond the inside face of the manhole wall.
Concrete placed inside the manhole to form the channel through the manhole
shall not be placed between the pipe and the opening so as to interfere in any
way with the flexibility of the joint.
   (v)   Drop Manholes. Drop manholes shall be used when the invert of the
inflow sewer is 2.0 feet or higher than the manhole invert. When this
difference of elevation is less than 2.0 feet, the manhole invert shall be
filled and channeled to prevent solids deposition.
   Due to the unequal earth pressure that would result from the backfilling
operation in the vicinity of the manhole, the entire outside drop connection
shall be encased in concrete.
   Drop manholes shall be constructed with outside drop connection, except
where such connections are not practical. Inside drop connection to be used
only with the approval of the City. Manholes located in isolated areas should
be provided with bolted covers for safety and to discourage vandalism.
   (w)   Test Inspection.  The leakage and deflection tests are to be carried
out by the contractor and witnessed and certified by the City officials and/or
their representative.
   All pipe which does not meet the testing requirements must be repaired and
retested until it meets the requirements.
   (x)   Railroad and Highway Crossings. When boring is required, the casing
pipe shall be designed to meet the requirements of the authority having
jurisdiction and in compliance with the City of Urbana Construction Standards
and Drawings. The size of the casing pipe shall be at least 4 inches greater
than the largest outside diameter of the sewer pipe, joints, or couplings.
   (y)   Stream Crossings.
      (1)   Location of sewers in streams.  
         A.   Cover depth. The top of all sewers entering or crossing streams
shall be at a sufficient depth below the natural bottom of the streambed to
protect the sewer line. In general, the following cover requirements must be
met:
            1.   One foot of cover where the sewer is located in rock.
            2.   Three feet of cover in other material. In major streams, more
than 3 feet of cover may be required.
            3.   In paved stream channels, the top of the sewer line should be
placed below the bottom of the channel pavement.
Less cover will be approved only if the proposed sewer crossing will not
interfere with the future improvements to the stream channel. Reasons for
requesting less cover shall be provided in the project proposal.
         B.   Horizontal Location. Sewers located along streams shall be
located outside of the streambed and sufficiently removed therefrom to provide
for future possible stream widening and to prevent pollution by siltation
during construction.
         C.   Structures.    The sewer outfall, headwalls, manholes, gate
boxes, or other structures shall be located so they do not interfere with the
free discharge of flow through the stream.
         D.   Alignment. Sewer crossing streams should be designed to cross the
stream as nearly perpendicular to the stream flow as possible and shall be free
from change in grade. Sewer systems shall be designed to minimize the number of
stream crossings.
      (2)   Construction.
         A.   Materials. Sewers entering or crossing streams shall be
constructed of ductile iron pipe with mechanical joints; otherwise they shall
be constructed so they will remain watertight and free from changes in
alignment or grades. Material used to backfill the trench shall be stone,
course aggregate, washed gravel, or other materials which will not readily
erode, cause siltation, damage pipe during placement, or corrode the pipe.
         B.   Siltation and Erosion. Construction methods that will minimize
siltation and erosion shall be employed. The design engineer shall include in
the project specifications the method(s) to be employed in the construction of
sewers in or near streams. Such methods shall provide adequate control of
siltation and erosion by limiting unnecessary excavation, disturbing or
uprooting trees and vegetation, dumping of soil or debris, or pumping silt-
laden water into the stream. Specifications shall require that cleanup,
grading, seeding, and planting or restoration of all work areas shall begin
immediately. Exposed areas shall not remain unprotected for more than seven
days.
   (z)   Sewage Pumping Stations.
      (1)   General.
         A.   When sewage pump stations are required, they shall be designed
and installed per the following standards:

         B.   Flooding.  The wastewater pumping station structures and
electrical and mechanical equipment shall be protected from physical damage by
the 100-year flood. Wastewater pumping stations should remain fully operational
and accessible during the 25-year flood. Regulations of state and federal
agencies regarding floodplain obstructions shall be followed.
      (2)   Pump station type and standard requirements. Listed below are the

1171.01 HILLSIDE AREA.
   These Regulations apply to all hillside areas. A hillside area as referred
to herein is defined as one with an average slope of more than fifteen percent
(15%). These areas may be found in the three-mile area outside the corporation
limits. The subdivider shall submit sufficient detailed information as to
geologic conditions, soil types and underground water level in order that a
determination can be made by the City or County Engineer, as the case may be,
as to the safety of development of the particular location.
(1984 Code Sec. 151.100)
1171.02 DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE SLOPE.
   The average slope and soil stability for any hillside development shall be
determined by the City Planning Commission during the time of preliminary
subdivision design. Determination shall be on an area-by-area basis with each
lot sized according to the average topographic change falling within each area.
(1984 Code Sec. 151.101)
1171.03 MINIMUM LOT REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.
   The minimum lot requirements (for minimum lot size requirements see chart
below) shall be used to determine the minimum lot area for a single-family
home. The average percent of slope is determined by the City Planning
Commission. The lot area in thousands of square feet shall then be determined
by charting the average natural ground slope and the minimum lot area. Rounding
shall be made to the nearest five-foot frontage interval. Deviations from these
requirements may be allowed subject to determination by the Commission where
exceptional circumstances warrant.

1171.04 GRADING PLAN AND CONTROLS.
   The grading plan shall show contour lines at five-foot intervals where
average slopes exceed fifteen percent (15%) and at two-foot intervals where
slopes are less than fifteen percent (15%). Elevations are to be based on the
sea level datum (USGS), if available. The approximate lot layout and the
approximate dimensions shall be shown for each lot and each building site.
Where pads are utilized or proposed for building sites, engineering data shall
show the existing topography and the approximate finished grades, location and
size of each building site and finished grade of streets prior to consideration
of the final plat.
(1984 Code Sec. 151.103)
1171.05 CUTS AND FILLS.
   No land shall be graded, cut or filled so as to create a slope exceeding a
vertical rise of one foot for each two and one-half feet of horizontal distance
between abutting lots, unless a retaining wall of sufficient height and
thickness is provided to retain the graded bank. Major cuts, excavation,
grading and filling, where the same materially changes the site and its
relationship with surrounding areas or materially affects such areas, shall not
be permitted if such excavation, grading and filling will result in a slope
exceeding a vertical rise of one foot for each two and one- half feet of
horizontal distance between abutting lots or between adjoining tracts of land,
except where adequate provision is made to prevent slides and erosion by
cribbing and retaining walls.
(1984 Code Sec. 151.104)

   (b)    Location.
      (1)   In accordance with ORC 4939.0314(0), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation, the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100' or a distance equal to the width of the
Right-of-Way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater. The City of Urbana also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration shall be utilized whenever possible and shall only be surpassed
if in the determination of the Zoning Officer, clear and convincing evidence
supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be grounds for such a
determination. The order of preference is as follows:
         A.   First, small cell facilities shall be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.   Second, small cell facilities shall be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         C.   Third, small cell facilities shall be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
City Right-of-Way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
         D.   Fourth, small cell facilities shall be collocated on an existing
pole located within the City Right-of-Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         E.   Fifth, small cell facilities shall be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
         F.   Sixth, small cell facilities shall be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference
         G.   Seventh, small cell facilities shall be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right-of-Way.
      (2)   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 1230'
from any existing small cell facility.
   (c)    Wireless Facilities Design.

         A.   Wireless support structures shall be limited to 40 feet in
height.
         B.   Wireless support structures shall be capable of supporting at
least two small cell facility operators.
         C.   New wireless support structures shall have design elements as
shown in Engineering Standard 1167.24:
            1.    Exception - If the neighborhood context would be better
served by a pole of a different material, color, style, or base as determined
by the Zoning Officer, then such design elements may be substituted with an
alternate design element. Such determination shall be based on the following
factors:
               a.    The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
               b.    The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
               c.    The historical context of a district or specific site;
               d.    A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.
      (2)   Small cell facilities shall be subject to the following design
standards:
         A.    The City reserves the right to require the following:
            1.    Antenna and all associated equipment shall be concealed to
the extent deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer in response to the aesthetic
context of the small cell facility. Some possible configurations include but
shall not be limited to the following:
               a.    Antenna(s) associated with the first fitting on a wireless
support structure shall be top-mounted and concealed within a radome that also
conceals the cable connections, antenna mount and other hardware. The Zoning
Officer may approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial fitting if, in the
Zoning Offer's discretion, the sidemounted antenna would be more appropriate
given the built environment, neighborhood character, overall site appearance
and would promote the purposes of this Chapter.
               b.    GPS antennas be placed within the radome or directly above
the radome not to exceed six inches.
         B.   Each Antenna and all associated equipment shall not exceed 6
cubic feet in volume.
         C.   All portions of a Small Cell Facility other than an antenna and
as identified by the ORC 4939.01 (P)(2), shall not exceed 28 cubic feet in
volume per facility.
         D.   Small cell facilities mounted to a wireless support structure
shall be completely concealed within a common enclosure capable of containing
at least two small cell facilities. Such common enclosures shall:
            1.    Not exceed 21 cubic feet in volume;
            2.    Not exceed 90 inches in height, 20 inches in width, or 20
inches in depth;
            3.    Not extend more than 24 inches away from the pole on which it
is mounted;
            4.    Shall be centered on the vertical axis of the pole to which
it is mounted;
            5.    Be mounted at a distance of at least 10 feet measured from
grade to the bottom of the enclosure;
            6.    Be mounted on the side of the pole facing away from nearest
traffic lane's direction of travel.

which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of the small cell facility
is better suited to another color, as determined by the Zoning Officer.
            3.    Style - The enclosure shall match the style, or lack thereof,
of the pole on which it is mounted unless the surrounding context of the small
cell facility is better suited to another style, as determined by the Zoning
Officer.
            4.    Coordinated Design Elements- common enclosures when located
within 5000' of an existing common enclosure shall match the design elements of
the existing common enclosure unless the surrounding context of the small cell
facility is better suited to an alternate design.
         F.   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an underground
vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a small cell
facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be satisfied as
determined by the Zoning Officer:
            1.    The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e. - bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.
If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Zoning Officer shall reserve the
right to require any of the following conditions:
               a.    Concealed Enclosure - All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Zoning Officer.

necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Zoning Officer.
               c.    Camouflage - Camouflaging elements may be required. Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
            2.    The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 30".
               (Ord. 4497-18. Passed 6-19-18.)
1182.16 RESERVATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   The City reserves the right to reserve space for future public safety or
transportation uses in the Right-of-Way or on a wireless support structure or
pole owned or operated by the City in a documented and approved plan in place
at the time an application is filed. A reservation of space shall not preclude
placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility. If replacement of
the City's pole or wireless support structure is necessary to accommodate the
collocation of the small cell facility and the future use, the small cell
facility operator shall pay for the replacement of the pole or wireless support
structure, and the replaced pole or wireless support structure must accommodate
the future use.
(Ord. 4497-18. Passed 6-19-18.)
1182.17  NONCONFORMITY.
   A nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support structure shall
immediately lose its nonconforming designation and must be brought into
compliance with all of the provisions of this Chapter, and all other applicable
City laws and ordinances or be removed if any of the following conditions are
present:

1183.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect,
maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare
by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse
effects of increased storm water runoff and nonpoint source pollution
associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that
proper management of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and
private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety,
environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic
resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      (1)    Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development
activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health
of water resources;
      (2)    Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-
development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as
practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source
pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of
stream channels and aquatic habitats;
      (3)    Establish minimum stormwater management standards and design
criteria for the regulation and control of storm water runoff quantity and
quality;
      (4)    Establish design and application criteria for the construction and
use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the
minimum stormwater management standards;
      ( 5)    Encourage the use of nonstructural storm water management and
storm water better site design practices, such as the preservation of
greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable.
      (6)    Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and
maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural
stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as
designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and,
      (7)    Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review,
approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection
of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
   (b)    Applicability.
      (1)    This chapter shall be applicable to all land development,
including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision
applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection
(b)(2) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment
site that meets one or more of the following criteria:
         A.   New development that involves the creation of 10,000 square feet
or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities
of 1 acre or more;
         B.   Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement
of 10,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land
development activity of one (1) acre or more;
         C.   Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is
defined by the City of Urbana Director of Administration or his/her designee to
be a hotspot land use; or,
         D.   Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum
applicability criteria set forth in items A and B above if such activities are
part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and
distinct land development activities may take place at different times on
different schedules.
      (2)    The following activities are exempt from this chapter:
         A.   Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not
part of a subdivision or phased development project;
         B.   Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex
residential structures;
         C.   Agricultural land management activities within areas zoned for
these activities; and,
         D.   Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed
necessary by the City of Urbana Director of Administration or his/her designee.
   (c)    Designation of Administrator. The City of Urbana Director of
Administration or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and
implement the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)    Compatibility with Other Regulations. This chapter is not intended to
modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of
law. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to the requirements of
any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any
provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by
any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever
provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human
health or the environment shall control.
   (e)    Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection,
paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter shall be adjudged invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate
the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of
this chapter.
   (f)    Stormwater Manual. It is the responsibility of the developer and his
design engineer to design, construct, and maintain the development using
current policy, criteria, and information available from a variety of sources.
An example of good storm water management practices and construction procedures
can be found in the most current version of the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources "Rainwater and Land Development Manual" as found on the ODNR website
for the proper implementation of the requirements of this chapter. The manual
may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science,
engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience. (Ord. 4382. Passed 3-
13-12.)

safety and economic impacts of structures which remain vacant for long periods
of time, including but not limited to administrative costs for registering and
processing the vacant building owner registration form and for the costs

the costs incurred by the City for demolition and hazard abatement of or
repairs to vacant buildings, as well as the continued normal administrative
costs stated above.

($200.00) for the first year the building remains vacant. For every consecutive
year that the building remains vacant, an annual fee will be assessed at double
the previous year's fee amount for a maximum annual fee equaling the five-year
fee of three thousand two hundred dollars ($3,200) to be used for the fifth and
for all consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
   (b)    The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the building is
registered. If the owner successfully restores the building to occupancy or
demolishes it in accordance with applicable law during the first year following
registration, the fee shall be refunded, less an administrative charge equal to
5% of the amount refunded. In each subsequent year, if the registration is
renewed in timely fashion, there have been no violations associated with the
property in the previous year, and re-inspection reveals no significant
housing, building or fire code violations, one-half of the previous year's
registration fee shall be refunded to the owner, less an administrative charge
equal to 5% of the amount refunded.
   (c)    The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the property is granted an exemption.
   (d)    All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer
of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed on the
property to collect delinquent fees.
   (e)    Absent a showing of good cause, if a building is not registered
within the time frame required in Section
1341.03, or the registration is not renewed within 30 days after the expiration
of one year from the date of the previous registration, a penalty shall be paid
in addition to the annual registration fee. The penalty shall be equal to one-
half of the current annual fee or one thousand dollars ($1,000), whichever is
less. (Ord. 4484-17. Passed 10-17-17.)
1341.06 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   A building under active construction, reconstruction or renovation and
having a valid building permit(s) at the time of initial inspection shall be
exempt from registration until the expiration of the longest running, currently
active building permit.
   (b)   A building which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by extreme
weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement for a
period of 90 days after the date of the fire or extreme weather event if the
property owner submits a request for exemption in writing to the Director of
Administration or his duly designated representative. This request shall
include the names and addresses of the owner or owners, and a statement of
intent to repair and reoccupy the building in an expedient manner, or the
intent to demolish the building. One extension of not more than 90 days'
duration may be granted for good cause shown.
   (c)    A building that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of Ohio
Realtor shall be exempted for a period of 12 months from the start of vacancy,
provided that the owner submits proof to the Director of Administration or his
duly designated representative of such listing and for sale status, and the
building and premises is maintained free of any property maintenance
violations. A building that has been granted an exemption pursuant to the
following: Any owner of a vacant building may voluntarily register the same and
request an exemption from the remaining provisions of this chapter by filing a
written application with the Director of Administration or his duly designated
representative, who shall timely consider same. In determining whether a
request for exemption should be granted, the Director shall consider the
following: the applicant's prior record as it pertains to City Zoning Code,
City Nuisance Code, and/or Building Code violations; the amount of vacant
property the applicant currently has within the City; the length of time that
the building for which the exception is sought has been vacant; the reason or
reasons for the vacancy; and the difficulty or expense involved in any
necessary remediation or demolition. No exemption from registration shall be
granted unless the owner or representative first completes a vacant building
plan under Section
1341.03( c) and addresses any and all existing code violations. An owner who
believes he or she is being denied an exemption for arbitrary or capricious
reasons may file an appeal of such denial within ten days with the Board of
Nuisance Appeals, which may sustain, overturn or modify the action of the
Director of Administration or his duly designated representative.
(Ord. 4484-17. Passed 10-17-17.)
1341.07 APPEALS.
   Any owner who is served a notice of vacant property registration, may,
within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of such notice, apply for an exemption
or appeal the decision as set forth in Section
1339.05 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Urbana.
(Ord. 4484-17. Passed 10-17-17.)
1341.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provision of the Vacant Building Registry shall be
subject to the penalties provided by Section
1339.99 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Urbana.
(Ord. 4484-17. Passed 10-17-17.)

1351.01 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)    Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)    Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)    Base Flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one
percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)    Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)    Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)    Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)    Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)    Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)    Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)    Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)    Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
Zone AO:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
Zone AH:     Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
Zone A99:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-
year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)    Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)    Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one (1) foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)    Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)    Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)    Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Urbana's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)    Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data showing that
a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area.
A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes
that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually
due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and comment by FEMA
as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood
Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)    Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Urbana Flood
Insurance Rate Map, April 3, 1984, and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
   (aa)    Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (bb)    Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)    Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)    Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)    Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)    Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)    Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)    Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)    Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)    Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)    Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)    Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 4311. Passed 10-27-09.)
1351.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization of the City of Urbana. Article XVIII, Section
3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt
land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Urbana, State of
Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Urbana has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;

these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Urbana as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Urbana.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map, Champaign County, Ohio and incorporated
areas and Flood Insurance Study, Champaign County Ohio and incorporated areas
both effective November 18, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Urbana as required by Chapter
1159  (Minor Subdivisions) and Chapter
1161  (Major Subdivisions).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Urbana Engineer's Office, 2nd Floor
Municipal Building, 205 South Main Street, Urbana, Ohio 43078.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances or resolutions including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance or resolution, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant
or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by
the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Urbana, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1351.03(j).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Director of
Administration of City of Urbana, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Urbana have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Urbana's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Urbana
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Urbana suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Urbana has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1351.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1351.04 (i).
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,

stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Urbana specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1351.03 (j) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 4311. Passed 10-27-09.)
1351.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Council of the City of Urbana shall appoint an Appeals Board
composed of five members (one member of each ward, and an at large
representative recommended by the Champaign County Soil and Water Conservation
District.) The members shall serve four (4) year terms after which time they
shall be reappointed or replaced by the Council of the City of Urbana. Initial
terms of office of the four ward representatives shall be for one (1), two (2),
three (3), and four (4) years, with each of the ward representatives to be
appointed for full four-year terms thereafter. The representative from the Soil
and Water Conservation District shall be initially appointed for a full four-
year term. Each member shall serve until his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Clerk of Council's office located at 205 South Main Street, Urbana, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1351.05 (d).
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 10 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by an
application fee set in the schedule of fees as determined by the Board of
Control.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         L.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         M.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         N.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         O.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         P.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1351.05 (d)(3) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Champaign Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 4311. Passed 10-27-
09.)
1351.99 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1351.03 (i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in subsection (c)
hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a misdemeanor of the
first degree. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Urbana. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Urbana from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Urbana shall prosecute any
violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

newspaper of general circulation in Champaign County when the name, usual place
of residence or business or existence of such person or legal entity is unknown
and cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained or in the event all of the
other methods in subsections (e)(1) through (4) hereof fail to effect delivery

1501.07 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   (a)   The Court of Common Pleas shall have jurisdiction, upon a complaint
filed by the Chief of the Fire Prevention Bureau to restrain, immediately or
before the imminence of such danger can be eliminated through the enforcement
procedures otherwise provided by Chapter
1501 , any condition or practices in any building or upon any premises which
violate the State Fire Code and are such that a fire or explosion hazard exists
which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm. Any
order issued under this section may require such steps to be taken as may be
necessary to avoid, correct or remove such imminent danger.
   (b)   Upon the filing of any such complaint, the Court has jurisdiction to
grant such injunctive relief or temporary restraining order pending the outcome
of an enforcement proceeding pursuant to Chapter

conditions or practices described in subsection (a) hereof exist in any
building or on any premises, he shall inform the owner, operator, lessees,

fails to seek relief under this section, any person who may be injured by
reason of such failure may bring an action against him in the court of common
pleas of the county in which the imminent danger is alleged to exist for a writ
of mandamus to compel him to seek such relief.
(Ord. 3803. Passed 10-10-89.)

   If any responsible person fails to comply with an order of the Chief of the
Fire Prevention Bureau or a certified Fire Safety Inspector as finally affirmed
or modified pursuant to Section
1501.06 within the time fixed in such order, then such officer may cause the
building or premises to be repaired, torn down, demolished, materials removed
or the conditions remedied, if such was the mandate of the order, at the
expense of the responsible person. At least thirty days prior to the repairing,
tearing down, or demolition of any building or premises, or to the removal of
materials or the remedying of such conditions, the officer shall give notice by
certified mail of his intention with respect to such building or premises to
the holders of liens of record upon the real property on which such building or
premises is located and to owners of record of such property. The holders of
liens of record upon such property may enter into an agreement with the officer
to perform the repair, tearing down, demolition, removal or other remedial
action. If an emergency exists, as determined by the officer, notice may be
given other than by certified mail and less than thirty days prior to such
repair, tearing down, demolition, removal or other remedial action. If for any
reason notice is not given, the liens provided for in this section are
subordinate to any liens of prior record. If the responsible person, within
thirty days thereafter, fails, neglects or refuses to pay the expense incurred
in enforcing the order of the officer under this section, such officer shall
certify the expenses, together with a twenty-five percent (25%) penalty thereon
to the County Auditor and the Auditor shall enter such expense on the tax
duplicate of such County as a special charge against the real estate on which
such building or premises is or was situated and the same shall be collected as
other taxes. (Ord. 3803. Passed 10-10-89.)
