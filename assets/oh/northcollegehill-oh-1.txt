matter of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time, and
 
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane

   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of North College
Hill, State of Ohio, a majority of the members elected thereto concurring:
 
   Section 1.
   That the ordinances of the City of North College Hill, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicated the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

of Council may consider among other matters:

      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daying Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
103.01   Datum line established.

103.01 DATUM LINE ESTABLISHED.
   The datum or zero point for all engineering works under the direction and

observations of the United Stales Coast and Geodetic Survey, and all grades and
elevations hereafter established by the City shall refer to this datum. (Ord.
36. Passed 8-17-18.)
103.02 OFFICIAL CITY FLAG.
   (a)    The flag described below is adopted as the official flag of the City
of North College Hill, Ohio.
      (1)   The flag consists of an emblem ringed in gold on a field of
burgundy. In the emblem is displayed a view of the northern ridge of hills of
Hamilton County with a background of the evening sky. In the sky the moon and
north star is prevelant. Both the moon and north star derive their brightness
because of the reflection of the sun just as North College Hill reflects the
brightness of spirit.
      (2)   At the base of the hills is a triangular form, the legs of which
are scarlet, blue and yellow with the latin words FIDELETAS (fellowship),
COPULARE (co-operation), SOCIETAS (unity) inscribed respectfully. The
triangular form represents a most rigid form, the one which best resists
pressure from external sources. The strength of the triangle remains strong as
long as each leg retains its' rigidity.
      (3)   At the bottom of the flag, the date 1941 represents the year North
College Hill became a city. (Res. 16-1985. Passed 6-3-85.)

and to illness, injury or death in the employee's immediate family. Unused sick
leave shall be cumulative without limit. When sick leave is used, it shall be

public agency to which the employee transfers. The appointing authority of each
department may require an employee to furnish a satisfactory written, signed
statement to justify the use of sick leave. If medical attention is required, a
certificate stating the nature of the illness from a licensed physician may be
required to justify the use of sick leave. Falsification of either a written,
signed statement or a physician's certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary
action including dismissal. This section shall be uniformly administered. No

termination of employment.

retire from the City service shall be entitled to a terminal leave of absence
equal to his accumulated sick leave or to the transfer of his sick leave credit
to some other agency as provided by Section
143.08 and Ohio R. C 124.38. An employee may receive one or more payments under
this section, but the aggregate value of accrued but unused sick leave credit
that is paid shall not exceed, for all payments, the value of 180 days of
accrued but unused sick leave. If the employee elects to take his terminal
leave, he may do so only after submission of his notice of intent to retire and
prior to the effective date thereof. "Retirement", as used in this section,
means disability or service retirement under the State or Municipal retirement
system.
(Ord. 10-1980. Passed 3-17-80.)
   (b)   In addition to the payment for accumulated sick leave provided for in
subsection (a) hereof, a regular employee retiring from the City service may
elect to receive payment for any accrued but unused vacation days rather than
take time off prior to retirement. An electing employee shall receive the
vacation payment as part of his final paycheck from the City.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of
the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold North College Hill
City income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and

taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with North
College Hill an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
171.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the North College Hill by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian

enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.

file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the

shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to North College
Hill City's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
           (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated North College Hill City income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to North College Hill. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated North College Hill City income tax return for a taxable
year shall file a consolidated North College Hill City income tax return for
all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated North College Hill City
income tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
(2)(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject
to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated North College Hill City
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

Section
171.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to North
College Hill;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to North College Hill
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated North College Hill City income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
171.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated North College Hill City income
tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by North College Hill in accordance
with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more
members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with North College Hill before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with North College Hill may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to North College Hill,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:

an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
171.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is

payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
North College Hill under Section
171.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in North College Hill
City but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar
year that includes the first day of the taxable year.

171.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
171.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in

refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
171.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
171.18 (A)(4).

deposited with another municipality, is allowable by North College Hill as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with North College Hill is subject to recovery by North

such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If North College Hill City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
North College Hill City's tax rate. However, if North College Hill City's tax
rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in
excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to North College Hill, along
with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

North College Hill City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with North College Hill. The amended return shall be filed on a form required
by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
171.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
171.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by North College Hill. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
171.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's North College Hill City's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended North College Hill City return
showing income subject to North College Hill City income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional North College Hill City income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.

171.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
171.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
171.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by North College Hill does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
171.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
171.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover North College Hill City income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 20-2015. Passed 12-30-15.)
171.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 12-30-15.)
171.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio
Revised Code is not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator,
except when the reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to
acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code. With the permission of the person affected by an
assessment, the Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the Ohio Revised Code. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new
last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other North College Hill City
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
           (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other North College
Hill City official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 12-30-15.)
171.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to North College Hill that arises pursuant to North College Hill City's income
tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
           (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a
claim by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 12-30-15.)
171.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of North College Hill
as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit North College Hill from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 12-30-15.)
171.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by North College Hill City ordinance
or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud North College Hill or the Tax
Administrator.

taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to North College Hill on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
North College Hill to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

171.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the

that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no

papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
171.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
171.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

171.99 for a violation of Section
171.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

subject to appeal.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member

171.28 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
171.27-
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill that is not
otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable context in both the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of
the Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the
laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall have control
over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is
defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in
that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal
Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to federal income
taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and section 718.01 of the
Revised Code, the definition in this section shall control for all uses of that
term in sections
 171.27 through

   As used in sections
171.27-
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill only:
   (A)    “Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
 171.29 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill as
applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward available
to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code, means a
C corporation's federal taxable income before net operating losses and special
deductions as determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the

Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
171.34 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or

group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
171.34 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (b)(2) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election
described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code, the
taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if
the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar
amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible
expense unless such payments are in consideration for the use of capital and
treated as payment of interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code
or United States treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified
self employed retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer,
amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts
paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed

allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section 718.01 of the Revised
Code, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer"
may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required

purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and includes declarations of
estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
171.27 -
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill is changed
accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of more than one taxable year for
federal income tax purposes. The tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an
appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a change of
its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two
or more short taxable years for federal income tax purposes as the result of a
change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable
year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax

171.29 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
section
171.27 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever

As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the

excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
section 718.011 of the Revised Code;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
171.38 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(l) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
171.38 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer:
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
       (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion
of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and

may be judged or contains information that on its face indicates that the
return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner
is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the
return to delay or impede the administration of sections
171.27 to
 171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill, a penalty
of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
171.27 to
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill, a penalty
may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred
per cent of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
171.39 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill, a penalty
may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred
per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division, any refund
issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the refund,
may be assessed under section
171.38 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill without
regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by division (A) of
that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
 171.27 to
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill and shall
be credited and distributed to municipal corporations in the same proportion as
the underlying tax liability is required to be distributed to such municipal
corporations under section
171.30 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
(Ord. 29-17. Passed 12-4-17.)
171.38 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
171.27 to
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill fails to
file the return within the time prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails
to remit the full amount of the tax due for the period covered by the return,
the tax commissioner may make an assessment against the taxpayer for any
deficiency for the period for which the return or tax is due, based upon any
information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three year time
limit in section
 171.39 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill for the
same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a
taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment as required by
sections
171.27 to
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the Citv of North College Hill, or that
files a fraudulent return. The commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed
written notice of the assessment as provided in section 5703.37 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of North College Hill. With the notice, the commissioner
shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a
hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entity with the clerk of
the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in
section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry
with the clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable,
unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance
with division (B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory
to the commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance
of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice
the commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
    (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is
pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the
subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the
petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
171.39 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 29-17. Passed 12-4-17.)
171.39  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
171.27 to
 171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill, including
assessments, shall be filed with the tax commissioner within three years after
the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within
any additional period allowed by division (A) of section
171.38 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill. The
application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner.
      (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner shall
determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The amount
detennined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or assessment. If
the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that claimed, the
commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget and management
and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund created in
section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than ten dollars
but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in accordance with
section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section
171.30 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 29-17. Passed 12-4-17.)
171.40  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
171.27 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill and used to
determine the tax due under sections
171.27 to
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill must be
altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and
such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the
taxpayer shall file an amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as
the commissioner requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than
sixty days after the adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for
federal income tax purposes or after any federal income tax deficiency or
refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or
paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer intends to file an amended
consolidated municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a
separate return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated
federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before
filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
171.38 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill for the
purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section, together with
any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no
longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended retum, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
 171.39 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill, if the
application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that section. An
application filed under this division shall claim refund of overpayments
resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in section
 171.39 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill. The
application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 29-17. Passed 12-4-17.)
171.41  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
 171.27 to
 171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no retum was filed,
to ascertain the tax due as required under those sections. Upon written request
by the commissioner or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
taxpayer or other person subject to this section is required to furnish the
opportunity for the commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate
and examine such books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
171.27 to
171.43 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill shall be
open to the tax commissioner's inspection during business hours and shall be
preserved for a period of six years following the end of the taxable year to
which the records or documents relate, unless the commissioner, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer. The commissioner may require any person, by notice served
on that person, to keep such records as the commissioner determines necessary
to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 29-17. Passed 12-4-17.)

tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of
the Revised Code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in

ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima-facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 FAILURE TO PAY FINES OR FULFILL A CONDITION OF SENTENCING.
   (a)   No person shall fail to pay a fine imposed by the Mayor as Judge of
North College Hill Mayor’s Court within the times and under the conditions
imposed by the Court.
   (b)   No person shall fail to fulfill any condition of sentencing order by
the Mayor as Judge of North College Hill Mayor’s Court including but not
limited to orders to attend counseling or training sessions, to participate in
work detail programs, to render community service or to make restitution to a
victim of crime. Failure to perform a condition of sentencing within the time
limits set by the Court shall constitute a violation of this section.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree.
(Ord. 55-1984. Passed 11-5-84.)
501.14 INMATES REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD CONFINEMENT COSTS.
   (a)   Any person convicted of an offense other than a minor misdemeanor
under the ordinances of the City and who is confined in the workhouse or county
jail shall reimburse the City for its expenses incurred by reason of his
confinement, including but not limited to, the expenses relating to the
provision of food, clothing and shelter. The amount of reimbursement shall be
determined by a court at a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15.
   (b)   The Director of Law is authorized to institute an appropriate civil
action in the name of the City in the court of common pleas of the county in
which the prison, station house, jail or workhouse is located, to recover from
the convict the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement in the
prison, station house or county jail, as determined by a court pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.15. The action shall be brought within one year after the person is
released from incarceration. The amount recovered shall be paid into the City
treasury. (Ord. 10-1985. Passed 3-4-85.)
501.15 ELECTRONICALLY MONITORED HOUSE ARREST.
   (a)   Any or all of the terms of imprisonment authorized under the
ordinances of the City may be served by means of electronically monitored house
arrest, in the sole discretion of the Mayor. In such case, the Mayor shall
determine the number of days of electronically monitored house arrest, and
whether any of the days of actual imprisonment shall be suspended on the
condition of successful completion of the incarceration by electronically
monitored house arrest. The sum of the days of actual imprisonment plus the
days of electronically monitored house arrest shall not exceed the stated
maximum number of days of imprisonment for that particular offense.
   (b)   No individual may serve a term of imprisonment by electronically
monitored house arrest unless he or she first executes an appropriate agreement
made available to all such defendants, whereby the defendant agrees to pay the

rules and regulations of the electronically monitored house arrest.
   (c)   No person, knowing that he or she is under the restrictions of
electronically monitored house arrest, shall purposely break or attempt to
break such detention, or purposely violate any of the requirements of the
detention. Whoever violates this section is guilty of escape, a misdemeanor of
the first degree. (Ord. 3-1991. Passed 1-23-91.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

505.01 DOGS RUNNING AT LARGE.
   (a)   No owner, keeper or harborer of any dog shall permit the dog to go
beyond the premises of the owner, keeper or harborer unless such dog is
properly on leash.
   (b)   For the purpose of this section:
      (1)   “Harborer” means any person who allows any dog habitually to remain
and be lodged and fed on or within the person’s property or home.
   (c)   It shall be prima facie evidence that a dog is not under the required
control if the dog chases, injures or kills any person or domestic animal, or
damages or commits any nuisance upon property other than that of its owner,
keeper or harborer.
   (d)   Lack of knowledge or lack of intent is not a defense to a violation of
this section.
   (e)   Subsection (a) is a necessary control on the unrestrained activity of
animals which threaten the safety and pleasantness of the streets, parks,
sidewalks, yards and all areas of the City.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(Ord. 27-1984. Passed 6-17-84.)
505.02 IMPOUNDING AND DISPOSITION; RECORDS.
   (a)   A police officer or animal warden may impound every animal or dog
found in violation of Section
505.01. If the dog is not wearing a valid registration tag and the owner is not
otherwise reasonably determined, notice shall be posted in the pound or animal
shelter both describing the dog and place where seized and advising the unknown
owner that unless the dog is redeemed within three days, it may thereafter be
sold or destroyed according to law. If the dog is wearing a valid registration
tag or the identity of the owner, keeper or harborer is otherwise reasonably
determined, notice shall be given by certified mail to such owner, keeper or
harborer that the dog has been impounded and unless redeemed within fourteen
days of the date of notice, it may thereafter be sold or destroyed according to
law. Any dog seized and impounded may be redeemed by its owner, keeper or
harborer at any time prior to the applicable redemption period upon payment of
all lawful costs assessed against the animal and upon providing the dog with a
valid registration tag if it has none.

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. (ORC 2909.03)

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,

aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part or any other equipment or
implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an aircraft and if
the violation does not create a risk of physical harm to any person, and if the

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)    (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

555.02 DECEPTIVE OR UNFAIR ACTS OR PRACTICES PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No supplier shall with knowledge commit a deceptive or unfair act or
practice in connection with a consumer transaction. Such deceptive act or
practice by a supplier violates this section whether it occurs before, during
or after the transaction.
   (b)   Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, an act, or practice of a

consumer for a reason that does not exist;
      (5)   That the subject of a consumer transaction has been supplied in
accordance with a previous representation, if it has not, except that the act
of a supplier in furnishing similar merchandise of equal or greater value as a
good faith substitute does not violate this section;
      (6)   That the subject of a consumer transaction will be supplied in
greater quantity, weight or volume than it contains or is made up of, or than
the supplier will deliver, does deliver or intends to deliver;
      (7)   That replacement or repair is needed, if it is not;
      (8)   That a specific price advantage exists, if it does not;
      (9)   That the supplier has a sponsorship, approval, or affiliation he
does not have;
      (10)   That a consumer transaction involves or does not involve a
warranty, a disclaimer of warranties, particular warranty terms, or other
rights, remedies or obligations if the representation is false;
      (11)   That goods or services will be supplied at an estimated price
given to the consumer to induce the transaction when in fact the actual charges
exceed the estimate by more than ten percent (10%), unless prior approval to
exceed the estimate is given to the supplier by the consumer;
      (12)   That periodic payments for consumer goods may be easily made by a
consumer when the supplier sets high payments in order to promote a default;
      (13)   That advertised goods and services are available when the supplier
did not sell them as advertised;

      (15)   That a consumer will receive a rebate, discount or other benefit
as an inducement for entering into a consumer transaction in return for giving
the supplier the names of prospective consumers, or otherwise helping the
supplier to enter into consumer transactions, if earning the benefit is
contingent upon an event occurring after the consumer enters into the
transaction;
      (16)   That a salesman, representative or agent has authority to
negotiate the final terms of a transaction with the consumer when no such
authority exists;
      (17)   That the consumer transaction confers or involves rights, remedies
or obligations that it does not have or involve or which are prohibited by law.
(Ord. 28-1985. Passed 8-5-85.)
555.03 UNCONSCIONABLE ACTS OR PRACTICES PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No supplier shall commit an unconscionable act or practice in
connection with a consumer transaction. Such an unconscionable act or practice
by a supplier violates this section whether it occurs before, during or after
the transaction.
   (b)   In determining whether an act or practice is unconscionable, the
following circumstances shall be taken into consideration:
      (1)   Whether the supplier has knowingly taken advantage of the inability
of the consumer reasonably to protect such consumer’s interests because of
physical or mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy or inability to
understand the language of an agreement;
      (2)   Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was
entered into that the price was substantially in excess of the price at which
similar property or services were readily obtainable in similar consumer
transactions by like consumers;
      (3)   Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was
entered into of the inability of the consumer to receive a substantial benefit
from the subject of the consumer transaction;
      (4)   Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was
entered into that there was no reasonable probability of payment of the
obligation in full by the consumer;
      (5)   Whether the supplier required the consumer to enter into a consumer
transaction on terms the supplier knew were substantially one-sided in favor of
the supplier;
      (6)   Whether the supplier knowingly made a misleading statement of
opinion on which the consumer was likely to rely to his detriment.
         (Ord. 28-1985. Passed 8-5-85.)

and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992.
   (b)   Cable Operator Response. Within thirty days of receiving notice from
the City or the ICRC, a cable operator shall file with the City or the ICRC,
its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (c)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council is able to expeditiously determine that the cable
operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rates within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City.
      (2)   If Council or the ICRC takes no action within thirty days from the
date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the City, the proposed
rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (d)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or
if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council shall, within
sixty days from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with
the City and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council needs more time to ensure that a rate is
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety or 150 day
period, Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received
by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
   (e)   Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (f)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector’s name and address.
   (g)   Benchmark Analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the benchmark
analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on
Council or the ICRC’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by ten percent (10%), or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for
inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September
30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator’s per channel was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the
initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. Council will review a
cost-of-service review. Council may approve initial basic cable rates above the
benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of- service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the
cable operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minimum ten percent (10%), will
prescribe the cable operator’s new rates.
   (i)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion by the City or the ICRC of
its review of the cable operator’s proposed rates, Council shall adopt its
decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         A.   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, Council shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         B.   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC’s
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of- service analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If Council determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable
operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, Council may order the
rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) hereof, as applicable.
In addition, Council may order the cable operator to pay to subscribers,
refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at
applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and
additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method for
paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC
regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
shall state the reasons for the decision and Council shall give public notice
of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in the
official newspaper of the City.
   (j)   Appeal. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with
applicable federal regulations. (Ord. 20-1993. Passed 12-6-93.)
707.03 REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (a)   Notice. A cable operator in the City who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the City and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least thirty days before
the cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be
given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (b)   Expedited Determination and Public Hearing.
      (1)   If Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap,
Council shall:
         A.   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         B.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the City.
      (2)   If Council takes no action within thirty days from the date the
cable operator filed its request with the City, the proposed rates will go into
effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public hearing at
which interested persons may express their views and record objections.
   (c)   Extended Review Period.
      (1)   If Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, Council
shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional
periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         A.   Ninety days if Council or the ICRC needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         B.   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If Council has not made a decision within the ninety to 150 day
period, Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period
requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received
by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
   (d)   Public Hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (e)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector shall provide the secretary with the objector’s
name and address.
   (f)   Delayed Determination. If Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if Council later issued a decision disapproving any portion
of the increase.
   (g)   Price Cap Analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, Council shall
review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC. Based on Council’s findings, the basic cable rates shall
be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, Council shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and
order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (h)   Cost-of-Service Showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
Council will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the
cable operators makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator’s then current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
   (i)   Decision. Council’s decision concerning the requested rate increase,
shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable
operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by
other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the city secretary to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (j)   Refunds.
      (1)   Council may order refunds of subscribers’ rate payments with
interest if:
         A.   Council was unable to make a decision within the extended time
period as described in subsection (c) hereof; and
         B.   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         C.   Council determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds
the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify the rate
increase by a cost-of-service showing, and Council disapproves any portion of
the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in Council’s decision resolution.
   (k)   Appeal. Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic service tier
or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with

923.04 NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in

limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with Codified Ordinances Chapter
923  and all Laws including any Rules and Regulations adopted by the Safety-
Service Director. The rights to locate Facilities and/or a System in and the
rights to occupy the Right of Way itself may not be subdivided or subleased;
provided, however Provider may sublease capacity (or other non-material
Facility aspects) and two or more Providers may collocate Facilities in the
same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider complies with the
provisions of this Chapter. Collocating Providers may file a joint application
for a Construction Permit. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a
Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before
collocating its Facilities on Facilities of others, including the City's
Facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from
leasing space in or on the Provider's System, so long as the sharing of
Facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of this
Chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from
complying with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable Law. (Ord.

the offering or provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City’s reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City. (Ord. 24-

responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to this Chapter and shall not be considered an
offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in this Chapter. The

month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the City of any
Registration Maintenance Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
City may have for additional sums payable.
   (f)   Costs of Publication. A Provider shall assume newspaper or other
appropriate publication costs of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
associated with its Certificate of Registration that may be required by Law or

   (a)   Technical Information Required. Prior to commencement of any initial
Construction of Facilities in the Rights of Way a Construction Permittee, upon
the reasonable request of the Safety-Service Director, shall provide technical
information about the proposed route of Construction. The technical information
required may consist of completion of the following tasks:
      (1)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
      (2)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited

repairs.
      (3)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on
whose behalf the Permit was applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way
along the proposed System route. Upon the reasonable request of the Safety-
Service Director, a Permittee shall also record and identify the general
location of all other Facilities in the Rights of Way along the proposed System
route. For the purposes of this Section, general location shall mean the
alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of Way, but shall not necessarily
mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights of Way.

existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
Construction Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A Construction Permittee shall not excavate more than a
three (3) foot by three (3) foot square hole in the Rights of Way to complete
this task.
      (6)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this Section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
(7)   All Confidential/Proprietary Information submitted herein shall be so
labeled.
   (b)    Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this Section
923.18  shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering or may
be performed by the Construction Permittee if the Construction Permittee is
qualified to complete the project itself.
 
   (c)   Cost of Study. The Construction Permittee shall bear the cost of
compliance with Sections
923.18 (a) through
923.18 (c) of this Chapter.
      (d)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this
Chapter, or unless the Safety-Service Director waives any of the requirements
of this Section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a Construction
Permittee shall be required to; submit a written Construction schedule to the
City ten (10) Working Days before commencing any work in or about the Rights of
Way and, shall further notify the City not less than two (2) Working Days in
advance of any excavation in the Rights of Way. This Section shall apply to all
situations with the exception of circumstances under Section
923.20 (d)(1). (Emergency Situations).
      (e)   Location of Facilities.  
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Rights of Way are
Full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights of Way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year, the protection of
existing Facilities in the Rights of Way, future City and County plans for
public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in
the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
      (3)   Upon the concurrence of the City, or if it is determined by the
Construction Permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or
other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the
Rights of Way are Full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional Facilities or Systems only
after the Construction Permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
paragraph shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new Facilities or additional
Facilities are attached.
   (f)   Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights of Way. In addition, all cable, wire or
fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface Rights of Way under this Chapter
may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire
or fiber optic cable may be installed under this Chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (g)   Relocation of Facilities.  
      (1)   A Provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and
relocate its Facilities in the Rights of Way whenever the City finds it
necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the City
requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable
Construction Permit Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall
restore the Rights of Way to a condition at least as good as its condition
immediately prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required
to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the City. The Safety-Service Director may request relocation and/
or removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's
Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City or
County;
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Right of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement if such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a Provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated
by the City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order is served
upon Provider, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the City, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City at Provider's cost and expense,
by another Person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the Provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the Provider,
and the Provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (h)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. Before the start date of any
Rights of Way excavation, each Provider who has Facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and make every
reasonable attempt using Best Efforts, to mark the approximate vertical
placement of all its Facilities. All Providers shall notify and work closely
with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of
its Facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
   (i)   Rights of Way Restoration.  
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights of Way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
Safety-Service Director, subject to any applicable Laws. The Permittee must
also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same
condition for twelve (12) months thereafter.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Permit, the City may choose
either to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way or the City may restore
the Rights of Way itself at the expense of the Permittee.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow Permittee to restore the Rights of
Way, Construction Permittee shall at the time of Application of a Construction
Permit post a Construction Bond in an amount determined by the City to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to Construction. If, twelve
(12) months after completion of the Restoration of the Rights of Way, the City
determines that the Rights of Way have been properly restored, the surety on
the Construction Bond shall be released.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the City.
      (5)   By restoring the Rights of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Works, correct all Restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Works. Weather
permitting, said work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days of the
receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Works.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, with
notice to Provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that
event, the Permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of billing,
the cost of restoring the Rights of Way and any other costs incurred by the
City. Upon Failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit
posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
   (j)   Damage to Provider's Facilities and to Other Facilities.  
      (1)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a Provider's Facilities to protect those Facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that Provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event the Provider does not pay
or the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by Permittee and
pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Facilities in the Rights of Way which it or its Facilities damage. Each
Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
Facilities of another Provider caused during the City's response to an
Emergency caused by such Provider's Facilities.
   (k)   Rights of Way Vacation. If the City vacates a Rights of Way which
contains the Facilities of a Provider, such vacation shall be subject to the
provisions of O.R.C. 723.04(a).
   (l)    Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights of Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable Laws and the standards as promulgated by the
Safety-Service Director.
   (m)   Inspection.  
      (1)   When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is completed, the
Permittee shall notify the Department of Public Works.
      (2)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by Law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (3)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the Inspector may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any Law, or which violates
the terms and conditions of the Permit and/or this Chapter.
      (4)   The Inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as provided
in Section
923.23(d). An order may be appealed to the Safety-Service Director. The
decision of the Safety-Service Director may be appealed to the Board of Zoning
Appeals whose decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days
after issuance of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Safety-
Service Director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not
been presented within the required time, the Safety- Service Director may
revoke the Permit pursuant to Section
923.20(e).
   (n)   Other Obligations. Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve
Permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and
authority and to pay all fees, including on site inspection fees, required by
the City, or any other city, county, state, or federal Laws.
      (1)   A Permittee shall comply with all requirements of Laws, including
the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service (OUPS) and/or its
lawful successor.
      (2)   A Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable Laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the

free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.
      (5)   Private vehicles other than necessary Construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (o)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. (Ord. 24-2001. Passed 11-5-01.)

(Ord. 21-2012. Passed 9-17-12.)
923.20 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Construction Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application; or
      (2)   To any Person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
City; or
      (3)   To any Person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for
the revocation of a Permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Safety-Service Director, the issuance
of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Safety-Service Director, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights of Way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial. The Safety-Service Director may deny a Permit in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights
of Way, or when necessary to protect the Rights of Way and its users. The
Safety-Service Director, in his or her discretion, may consider one or more of
the following factors: the extent to which Rights of Way space where the Permit
is sought is available; the competing demands for the particular space in the
Rights of Way; the availability of other locations in the Rights of Way or in
other Rights of Way for the proposed Facilities; the applicability of this
Chapter or other regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of
Facilities in the Rights of Way; the degree of compliance of the Provider with
the terms and conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding
communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the
Rights of Way; the condition and age of the Rights of Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the
costs of disruption to the public end damage to the Rights of Way, against the
benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the Rights of Way; and whether such Applicant or their agent has
failed within the past three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full
compliance, with the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other
Chapters of the Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable Law.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section's
923.20 (a)(1) and 
923.20 (a)(2), the Safety-Service Director may issue a Permit in any case where
the Permit is necessary;
      (1)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
      (2)   To allow such customer to materially improve its Service; or
      (3)   To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a Permit
under this Section, the Permit Applicant must not have had knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of Service, or the development project at
the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit.
      (1)   Emergency situations. Each Provider shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable, notify the Safety-Service Director of any event regarding its
Facilities which it considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to
take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency.
Within two (2) business days, unless otherwise extended by the Safety-Service
Director, after the occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is
later), the Provider shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees
associated therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this Chapter for any and all actions taken in response to
the Emergency.
   In the event that the City becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a
Provider 's Facilities, the City may attempt to contact the Provider or System
Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially affected, by the
Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary
in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an Emergency, any
Provider who Constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a Right
of Way without a valid Permit shall cease any further work upon the order of
the inspector or Safety-Service Director and before commencing any additional
work shall within 10 business days of initiating such construction obtain a
Permit, pay double the normal fee for said Permit, pay double all the other
fees required by the Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees
necessary to correct any damage to the Rights of Way and comply with all of the
requirements of this Chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any Law or any provision or
condition of the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a
Permit; or
         D.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required Construction or
Removal Bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section  
923.18 (d).
      (2)   If the Safety-Service Director determines that the Permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
provision or condition of the Permit, the Safety-Service Director shall serve a
written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shell
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit.
Upon, a substantial breach, as stated above, the Safety-Service Director, may
place additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Safety-Service Director
with a plan, acceptable to the Safety-Service Director, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Safety-Service Director, or the
Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation
of the Permit.
      (4)   From time to time, the Safety-Service Director may establish a list
of standard conditions for the Permit. A substantial breach of any condition
shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public Rights of Way as
defined in Section 
923.14 .
      (5)   If a Permittee, commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed
further Permits for one full year, except for Emergency repairs.
      (6)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including Restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation. (Ord. 24-2001. Passed 11-5-01.)
923.21 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any Construction, a
Construction Permittee, excluding the County or City shall deposit with the
Safety-Service Director, in a form acceptable to the Director of Law, an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in an amount
determined by the Safety-Service Director to be appropriate, based upon fair
and reasonable criteria. Unless a Construction default, problem, or deficiency
involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the
Safety-Service Director shall serve the Construction Permittee with notice
detailing any Construction default, problem, or deficiency. If the Safety-
Service Director determines that correction or repair of the Construction
default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been substantially
initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the date following service of
notification and detailing the construction default, problem or deficiency,
then the City may attach the letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment,
written notice shall be served on the Construction Permittee by the Safety-
Service Director.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration, and
continuously thereafter until one hundred twenty (120) days after a Provider's
Facilities have been removed from the Rights of Way, (unless the Safety-Service
Director notifies the Provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a
Provider shall deposit with the Safety-Service Director and maintain, in a form
acceptable to the Director of Law, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of
credit or a surety bond in an amount equal to or greater than fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000.00). The Safety-Service Director shall make all reasonable
efforts to allow Provider a period of five (5) business days after serving
notification to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to
Safety-Service Director's attachment of letter of credit or surety bond
regarding the removal of Facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall be
provided to the Provider by the Safety-Service Director.
   (c)   Blanket Bond. In lieu of the Construction Fond required by Section
923.21 (a) and the Removal Bond required by Section
923.21 (b), the Provider may deposit with the Safety-Service Director, in a
form acceptable to the Director of Law, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of
credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million dollars
($5,000,000.00). Unless a Construction default, problem or deficiency involves
an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Safety-Service
Director shall make all reasonable efforts to allow Permittee a period of five
(5) business days after sending notification in writing to the last known
business address to correct or repair any Construction default, problem or
deficiency prior to Safety-Service Director's attachment of letter of credit or
surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Provider
by the Safety-Service Director.
   (d)   Self Bonding. In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section
923.21 (a), the Removal Bond required by Section 
923.21 (b) and the Blanket Bond required by Section
923.21 (c), those Providers maintaining a book value in excess of twenty
million dollars ($20,000,000) may submit a statement to the Safety-Service
Director requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a
Provider shall assure the City that such self-bonding shall provide the City
with no less protection and security than would have been afforded to the City
by a third party surety providing Provider with the types and amounts bonds
detailed in the above named Sections. This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and,
      (2)   A description of the Applicant's self-bonding program; and,
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Safety-Service Director.
   (e)   Purposes. The bonds required by this Section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the Permittee or Provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this Chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the Permittee or Provider's violation of this Chapter or its failure to comply
with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and other directives of the City
issued pursuant to this Chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including Permit

      (5)   The removal of Facilities from the Rights of Way pursuant to this
Chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the Permittee or
Provider is liable that are not paid by insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this Chapter or other Law.
   (f)   Form. The bond documents required by this Section, and any replacement
bond documents shall, contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the Facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to City of surety's
intention to cancel or not renew this bond."

use of any facilities within the public rights of way shall notify the Safety
Service Director in writing of its intent to discontinue use. The notice shall
provide at least 30 days notice before determination and shall describe the
method of removal of the facilities and the restoration of the right of way.
The permittee shall not remove or disable such facilities without written
approval of the Safety Service Director. After approval, the permittee shall

six months, unless additional time is requested from and approved by the Safety
Service Director. In the event that the permittee requests permission to
abandon its facilities, or if the Safety Service Director determines, by
reasonable available evidence, that the permittee has in fact abandoned its
facilities, the City shall receive full title and ownership of such abandoned
facilities if the Safety Service Director elects to receive such ownership. The
permittee remains responsible for all obligations as owner of the facilities
until the conveyance to the City is completed. In the event that the City
accepts title to abandoned facility, the City does not assume any
responsibility for prior service or maintenance agreements with customers or
other service providers of the permittee. (Ord. 21-2012. Passed 9-17-12.)
923.22 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   City Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the acceptance of an
Application or the grant of a Permit, the City does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service

activity undertaken in or near a Rights of Way, whether any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a Permit. A Provider or
Permittee further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any
action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief
against the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers
and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its Facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a Rights of Way, whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a Permit. This Section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
Provider, Permittee, or to the City; and the Provider or Permittee, in
defending any action on behalf of the City, if allowable by Law, shall be
entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could
assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent
with, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all Providers and
Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the City or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith:
         A.   To persons or property, to the extent arising out of or through
the acts or omissions of Provider, its subcontractors, agents or employees
attributable to the occupation by the Provider or Permittee of the Rights of
Way, to which Permittee’s or Provider's negligence shall in any way contribute.
         B.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the Provider or Permittee, but
excluding claims arising out of or related to City programming.
         C.   Arising out of Provider's or Permittee’s failure to comply with
the provisions of any Law applicable to Provider or Permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving Provider or Permittee reasonable notice of any claim or
the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         B.   Affording the Provider or Permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to

923.23 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-Exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in this Chapter are not
exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City may have at Law
or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and
equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the Rights of Way,
including damages to the Rights of Way, whether caused by a violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of applicable Law.  
   (b)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this Chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, nonappealable order that any Permit, right or any portions of this
Chapter are illegal or unenforceable, then any such Permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable Permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60)
days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable Permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the Permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating
to the term of the Permit and the right of termination. If a Permit or right
shall be considered a revocable Permit as provided herein, the Permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable Permit and the
power to revoke it.
   (c)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The City by the granting
of a Permit, or by issuing a Certificate of Registration under this Chapter,
does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful
powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the City
under the Constitution and Laws of the United States or the State of Ohio to
regulate the use of the Rights of Way. The Permittee by its acceptance of a
Permit, or Provider by applying for and being issued a Certificate of
Registration, agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or
police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested
in or reserved to the City, shall be in full force and effect and subject to
the exercise thereof by the City at any time. A Permittee or Provider is deemed
to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers
of the City to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and
welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable
general Laws enacted by the City pursuant to such powers.
   (d)   Method of Service. Any notice or order of the Safety-Service Director
or Board of Zoning Appeals shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy
thereof is:

      (2)   Successfully transmitted via facsimile transmission to the last
known fax number of the person to be served; or

      (5)   If the notice is attempted to be served by certified, preposted
U.S. mail and then returned showing that the letter was not delivered, or the
certified letter is not returned within fourteen (14) days after the date of
mailing, then notice may be sent by regular, preposted, first-class U.S.; or

U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the letter is then returned showing that the
letter was not delivered, or is not returned within fourteen (14) days after

   (e)   Applies to all Providers. This Chapter shall apply to all Providers
and all Permittees unless expressly exempted.
   (f)   Police Powers. All Person’s rights are subject to the police powers of
the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public. All Persons shall comply with all applicable
Laws enacted by City pursuant to its police or other powers. In particular, all
Persons shall comply with City zoning and other land use requirements
pertaining to the placement and specifications of Facilities.
   (g)   Compliance. No Person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of this Chapter by reason of any failure of City to
enforce prompt compliance.
   (h)   Foreclosure and Receivership.
      (1)   Upon the filing of any voluntary or involuntary petition under that
Bankruptcy Act by or against any Provider and/or Permittee, or any action for
foreclosure or other judicial sale of the Provider and/or Permittees Facilities
located within the Rights of Way, the Provider and/or Permittee shall so notify
the Safety-Service Director within fourteen (14) calendar days thereof and the
Provider and/or Permittee's Certificate of Registration or Permit (as
applicable) shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect.

of this Chapter, any Certificate of Registration or Permit granted pursuant to
this Chapter, subject to any applicable provisions of Law, including the
Bankruptcy Act, one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of the Provider and/
or Permittee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred and twenty (120) days or
unless:
         A.   Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after election or
appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the
provisions of the relevant Certificate of Registration, any outstanding Permit
and of this Chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and,

any Certificate of Registration or Permit shall be construed and enforced in

United States of America, specifically in that order. All Providers and
Permittees as a condition for the grant of any Permit or issuance of any
Certificate of Registration agree that all disputes shall be resolved in a
court of competent jurisdiction in Hamilton County, Ohio.
   (j)   Force Majeure. In the event any Person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions, or obligations required by this Chapter 923 is prevented by

result thereof. For the purpose of this Section, causes or events not within

enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and
fires.

its right to authorize the Construction of Facilities on any particular Rights
of Way. The burden and responsibility for making such determination shall be
upon the Person constructing Facilities in the Rights of Way.
   (l)   Continuing Obligation and Holdover. In the event a Provider continues
to operate all or any part of the Facilities after the termination, lapse, or
revocation of a Certificate of Registration, such Provider shall continue to
comply with all applicable provisions of this Chapter and other laws throughout
the period of such continued operation, provided that any such continued
operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the
Certificate of Registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any,
available to the City as a result of such continued operation after the term,
including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between
the issuance of a Certificate of Registration or of a Permit and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter.

occupied by such nonconforming use within one year from the date such use
becomes nonconforming. It shall be the duty of the Building Commissioner to
issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the nonconforming use upon such
application, but failure to obtain such Certificate of Occupancy within one
year from the date shall create a conclusive presumption that such
nonconforming use did not exist prior to the effective date of this Zoning
Ordinance or of an amendment thereto, as the case may be.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
   (b)   Editor’s Note: Former subsection (b) hereof was repealed by Ordinance

charge therefor shall be set forth in the Hamilton County Zoning Fee schedule,

purpose of this Zoning Ordinance. In case of any question as to the location of

features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the
interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and in the
public interest. In authorizing a variance with attached conditions, the Board

the conditions attached are and shall be complied with.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)

the property in question, or to the intended use of the property, that do not
apply generally to other properties or classes of uses in the same zoning
district;
      (2)    Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same zoning

detriment to adjacent property, and will not materially impair the purposes of
this Zoning Ordinance or the public interest.

specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property, or the intended use of such property for which variance is sought,
one or the other or in combination, is not of so general or recurrent a nature
as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for
such conditions or situation.
(Ord. 16-1983. Passed 4-4-83.)
   (d)    Power to Reverse, Affirm or Modify. In exercising its power the Board

thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. For ordinances
involving residential property Council shall hold the public hearing required

   C-3 Central Business District
   C-4 General Business District.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1141.02 DISTRICTS AND BOUNDARIES ESTABLISHED.
   The several districts and boundaries thereof are hereby adopted and
established as shown on the Zoning Map of the City, which map, attached hereto
together with all notations, references, data, district boundaries and other
information shown thereon shall be and are hereby made a part of this Zoning
Ordinance. The Zoning Map, properly attested, shall be and remain on file in
the office of the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1141.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Except where referenced on the Zoning Map to a street or alley lines or
other designated line by dimensions shown on such Map, the district boundary
lines follow lot lines or the center lines of streets or alleys as they existed
at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance; but where a district line
obviously does not coincide with the lot lines or such center lines or where it
is not designated by dimensions, it shall be determined by scaling.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1141.04 LOT DIVIDED; EXTENSION OF DISTRICT.
   Where a district boundary line established in this chapter or as shown on
the Zoning Map divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Ordinance, the use authorized thereon and the other
district requirements applying to the least restricted portion of such lot
under this Zoning Ordinance shall be considered as extending to the entire lot,
provided the more restricted portion of such lot is entirely within twenty-five
feet of such dividing district boundary line. The use so extended shall be
deemed to be conforming. (Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1141.05 UNCERTAINTY AS TO BOUNDARIES; INTERPRETATION.
   All questions concerning the exact location of district boundary lines shall
be determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals, according to rules and
regulations which may be adopted by it. (Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1141.06 VACATED STREET OR ALLEY.
   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action
as provided by law, the zoning district adjoining the side of such public way
shall be extended automatically, depending on the side or sides to which such
lands revert, to include the right-of-way thus vacated, which shall henceforth
be subject to all regulations of the extended district or districts. (Ord. 1-
1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1141.07 PROPERTY NOT INCLUDED; ANNEXATIONS.
   In every case where property has not been specifically included within a
district, the same is hereby declared to be in the R-1 District. Township
zoning regulations in effect for territory annexed to or consolidated with the
City subsequent to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall, upon the
effective date of such annexation or consolidation, remain in force and effect
for a period not to exceed nine months. The Planning Commission shall recommend
to Council, within a period of not to exceed six months from such date of
annexation or consolidation, a zoning districting plan of such property in
accordance with provisions of Chapter
1129.

   The City Planning Commission shall act as the Board of Architectural Review
when considering any application for a certificate of appropriateness.
(Ord. 4-1988. Passed 3-21-88.)
1161.05 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW: CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   The Board of Architectural Review, in deciding whether to issue a
certificate of appropriateness, shall determine that the application under
consideration promotes and enhances the distinctive architectural character of
the community and would not be at variance with existing structures within that
portion of the district in which the structure is or is proposed to be located
as to be detrimental to the interests of the District. In conducting its
review, the Board shall make examination of and give consideration to the
elements of the application including, but not necessarily limited to:
      (1)    Height, which shall include the requirements of Section
1147.04  for an R-3 Multi-Family Residence District.
      (2)    Building massing, which shall include the relationship of the
building width to its height and depth, and its relationship to the viewer's
and pedestrian's visual perspective.
      (3)    Window treatment, which shall include the size, shape, and
materials of the individual window units and the overall harmonious
relationship of window openings.
      (4)    Exterior detail and relationships, which shall include all
projecting and receding elements of the exterior, including but not limited to,
porches and overhangs and the horizontal or vertical expression which is
conveyed by these elements.
      (5)    Roof shape, which shall include type, form and materials.
      (6)    Materials: texture and colors, which shall include a consideration
of material compatibility among various elements of the structure in relation
to the character of the design.
      (7)    Compatibility of design and details, which shall include the
appropriateness of the use of exterior design details, compatible with a
traditional style of architecture as approved by the Board.
      (8)    Landscape design and plant materials, which shall include, in
addition to requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, lighting and the use of
landscape details to highlight architectural features or screen or soften
undesirable views.
      (9)    Pedestrian environment, which shall include the provision of
features which enhance pedestrian movement and environment and which relate to
the pedestrian's visual perspective.
      (10)    Signage, which shall include, in addition to requirements of
Chapter
1175, the appropriateness of signage to the building.
   (b)    In conducting its inquiry and review, the Board may request from the
applicant such additional information, sketches and data as it shall reasonably
require. It may call upon experts and specialists for testimony and opinion
regarding the matters under examination. It may recommend to the applicant
changes in the plans that it considers desirable and may accept a voluntary
amendment to the application to include or reflect such changes. The Board may
keep a record of its proceedings and shall append to the application copies of
information, sketches and data needed to clearly describe any amendment to it.
   (c)    When its review is concluded, the Board will determine by a vote of
its members, whether the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall
be approved. If approved by three or more of its members, the Board shall
return the application and appended material to the secretary with the
instruction that the certificate of appropriateness be issued, provided all
other requirements of a building permit, if applicable, are met. If not
approved, the Board shall return the application and appended material to the
applicant with a notice that the certificate of appropriateness shall not be
issued because the application did not meet the criteria and standards set
forth herein. (Ord. 4-1988. Passed 3-21-88.)
1161.06 PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY UPON DEMOLITION OF A STRUCTURE.
   (a)    Whenever a structure within the District is proposed to be
demolished, an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed
with the Planning Commission Secretary as provided in this chapter. In
considering such application, the Board of Architectural Review shall limit its
inquiry to the proposal for grading, landscaping and other design treatment of
the property once the structure has been removed.
   (b)    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the demolition
of a structure whether public or private, within the District. (Ord. 4-1988.
Passed 3-21-88.)
1161.07 REPAIR OR MAINTENANCE EXCEPTION.

affirmative vote of a majority of its members, or failing to so elect, shall
reject the application for appeal. In the event Council elects to hold a public
hearing on the request for appeal, the hearing shall be held not later than
sixty days after a final decision has been rendered by the Board. Council, by a
majority vote of its members, shall decide the matter and its decision shall be
final.
   (c)    If no notice of intent to appeal is filed with the Planning
Commission Secretary and the Clerk of Council within the period specified in
subsection (a) hereof, Council may at the option of a majority of its members
and not later than ten days following the expiration of the appeal period,
elect to review any architectural review decision of the Board. Council shall
schedule a public hearing on the matter which shall not be held more than sixty
days after a final decision was rendered by the Board. At a public hearing,
Council by a majority vote of its members, shall decide the matter and its
decision shall be final.

CHAPTER 1163
Design Guidelines
1163.01    Purpose.
1163.02    Applicability.
1163.03    Zoning certificate.
1163.04    Design guideline standards.
1163.01 PURPOSE.
   The North College Hill Design Guidelines are intended to provide design
standards pertaining to commercial and mixed use districts areas, including
PUD's, wherever these are located, in order to provide for a clean, visually
appealing and cohesive design element in the commercial business districts in
the City. These regulations provide basic, general criteria to be used by the
Planning and Commission and Building Official when evaluating the
appropriateness of proposed development and redevelopment in the City.
   Further, these provisions are established to achieve the following:
   (a)   Strengthen, protect, enhance and improve the existing visual and
aesthetic character of the City, and to prevent the creation or perpetuation of
nuisances or blight in the City in commercial areas of substantial public and
private investment.
   (b)   To ensure that each new commercial development and redevelopment
project will be both functional and attractive.
   (c)   To protect and improve property values.
   (d)   To foster and encourage creative application of design principles.
   (e)   To ensure that these objectives are achieved through a review process
which assures that each proposal complies with these guidelines.
   (f)   To ensure development is consistent with the policies of the
Comprehensive Plan. (Ord. 2-2013. Passed 7-1-13.)
1163.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   All regulations of this Design Guidelines Chapter shall apply to and
control property development on any property within a commercially zoned
district. However, in the case of conflict between the provisions of a specific
design guideline and other regulations established in this Zoning Code, the
provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. The adoption of these design
guidelines shall not have any affect on a previously approved permits or
certificates or Planned Unit Development approval during the period of validity
of such approval.
   (b)   Unless otherwise identified, the design of the building or structure
applicable to this Chapter shall be cohesive and consistent with the character
of the adjacent buildings.
(Ord. 2-2013. Passed 7-1-13.)
1163.03 ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   No new construction, minor or major building improvements, as identified
below, may be made to any property where these regulations and standards apply
until a Zoning Certificate (Chapter
1125) has been issued by the Building Official.
   (a)   Minor Building Improvement.
      (1)   Minor demolition of non-significant parts of principal structures;
      (2)   Roof, cornice, window, door, step and wall repair or replacement;
unless work matches the original;
      (3)   Painting, only if there is a change in the colors from the
original;
   (b)   Major Building Improvement.
      (1)   New construction;
      (2)   Demolition, except where it qualifies as a Minor Building
Improvement above;
      (3)   Signs, awnings and hardware;
      (4)   Modifications to any facade that is visible from any public right-
of-way;
      (5)   Substantial expansion of existing principal structures (50% or more
of the gross floor area);
      (6)   All other improvements not determined to be minor building
improvements by the Building Official.
         (Ord. 2-2013. Passed 7-1-13.)
1163.04 DESIGN GUIDELINE STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall apply to the design and appearance of all new
construction or building renovation in a commercially zoned district. As a
consideration during any plan review, the Planning Commission shall determine
if the proposal complies with the following standards:
   (a)   Building Scale and Massing.
      (1)   Building Height.
   All buildings in the district shall conform to the height requirement for
the district in which it is situated as measured from the grade line at the
midpoint of the facade to the highest point of the building.
      (2)   Horizontal Design.
         A.   A building's vertical and horizontal dimensions shall be in
proportion to one another without over emphasis of either dimension.
         B.   Horizontally long buildings shall be visually broken up through
the use of recesses or setback variations, architectural detailing, various
roof heights and application of compatible building materials to cause the
façade to appear as a series of proportionally correct masses.
         C.   Neighboring structures may influence the placement of the common
horizontal elements (e.g., cornice line and window height, width, and spacing)
on new or infill structures.

CHAPTER 1169
Planned Unit Development District (PUD)
1169.01    Purpose.
1169.02    PUD district designation and general requirements.
1169.03    Establishment of the review process.
1169.04    Planning Commission and Council action on concept plan.
1169.05    Preliminary and final development plan submission requirements.
1169.06    Preliminary and final development plan approval process.
1169.07    Amendments to an approved planned unit development.
1169.08    Revocation.

uses and to allow procedures supplemental to those applicable in other use
districts to establish under which development plans particularly designed to
meet the objectives of this Chapter;
   (d)   To allow for creative development that conforms to the goals and
objectives set forth in the North College Hill Comprehensive plan;
   (e)   To encourage the best features of sustainable neighborhood
development;
   (f)   To promote business and employment opportunities, where applicable.
      (Ord. 2-2013. Passed 7-1-13.)
1169.02 PUD DISTRICT DESIGNATION AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Types of PUD's. Subsequent to the approval by City Council, the
designation of PUD may replace any existing zoning district, with the
limitations described herein. There are two types of PUD's permitted under this
zoning code:
      (1)   PUD-RES. A PUD may be predominately comprised of residential land
uses of varying types and densities, in which case it is referred to as a PUD-
RES. The tract of land proposed to be developed as a PUD-RES must be owned or
controlled by one person or single entity.
      (2)   PUD-BUS. A PUD may also be a commercial or mixed use development,
including commercial and residential uses, referred to and a PUD-BUS. The tract
of land proposed to be developed as a PUD-BUS must be owned or controlled by
one person or a single entity, and must be at least (1) contiguous acre in
size.
      (3)   Upon approval of the Final Development Plan according to Section
1169.06, the Official Zoning Code shall be amended to include the approved
regulatory language in the appendix of the code.
   (b)   Permitted Uses. The permitted uses in both the PUD-RES and PUD-BUS
district are as set forth below:
      (1)   Permitted Uses - PUD-RES. An applicant may propose to include any
mixture of permitted or conditional uses traditionally permitted in any
residential district established in this zoning code, as well as land uses
which are allowed as a permitted used in the C-1 district, provided that not
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the net acres in the development is
devoted to non-residential uses. Non-residential uses must be conducive to
providing services geared towards local neighborhood needs.
      (2)   Permitted Uses - PUD-BUS. An applicant may propose to include any
mixture of non-residential land uses in a proposed PUD-BUS development that is
permitted or is conditionally permitted in this zoning code. A PUD-BUS may
include residential uses only if such uses are located on the upper floor(s) of
a multi-story building.
   (c)   Development Standards and Guidelines. The following standards
represent broad parameters under which all PUD developments must be designed.
      (1)   General Review Guidelines for Approval. In evaluating a proposed
Development Plan, the following guidelines shall be used by the Planning
Commission and City Council.
         A.   The PUD district is consistent with the goals and objectives of
the NCH comprehensive plan.
         B.   The PUD district is an effective and unified treatment of the
development possibilities of the project site, and the development plan makes
appropriate provisions for the preservation of streams and stream banks, wooded
cover, rough terrain and similar areas.
         C.   The PUD district is planned and developed to harmonize with any
existing or proposed development in the area surrounding the project site.
         D.   Off-street parking and loading areas are provided in accordance
with Chapter
1177, unless otherwise altered by the PUD.
         E.   There is a beneficial relationship between the proposed PUD
district and the neighborhood/area in which it is to be established.
         F.   Evidence of sufficient or proposed off-site and on-site services
and infrastructure is presented. Said services or infrastructure shall be in
place at completion of construction of the project.
         G.   Common open spaces and recreational areas shall be accessible to
the entire PUD and community in general.
         H.   Commercial uses shall be compatible with the character of the
surrounding residential buildings.
         I.   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non-random fashion.
Long, unbroken building facades should be avoided.
         J.   Although not required, the projects should follow the
recommendations as published by the U.S. Green Building Council.
      (2)   Central Water and Sewer Facilities. All structures in developments
approved as a PUD must be served by central or public water and sewer
facilities.
      (3)   Development Layout and Design. The design and layout of all PUDs
shall display excellence in design by properly considering significant site
features such as topography, natural drainage patterns, roadway access and
circulation, surrounding land used, and general public welfare to result in
desirable and sustainable land development. Attractive landscaped buffer areas
shall be provided between the PUD and incompatible land use and activities.
      (4)   Utilities. All utility services in a PUD shall be entirely
underground.
      (5)   Circulation. The pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems shall
be designed to fully accommodate traffic generated by the development in a safe
and efficient manner.
         A.   Internal local streets shall connect to existing street systems
that are capable of handling the new traffic generated by the new development.
         B.   Pedestrian circulation systems shall connect to external
pedestrian systems either through sidewalks or trails.
      (6)   Required Open Space and Common Land: Public open spaces shall be
required as a condition of approval for any PUD. Public open spaces encompass
several types of spaces including open, undeveloped land or public gathering
spaces such as plazas, wider sidewalks for sidewalk cafés, urban gardens,
expanded tree lawns, or pocket parks that encourage public gatherings.
         A.   PUD-RES
A minimum of twenty percent (20%) (excluding areas for vehicle parking and
circulation) of the land developed for residential purposes in a PUD-RES
project shall be reserved for common open space including undeveloped land and/
or public gathering spaces. Clustering residential density is encouraged to
preserve undeveloped open space.
         B.   PUD-BUS
A minimum of fifteen (15%) of the land developed in a PUD-BUS shall be reserved
for public open spaces including undeveloped land and/or public gathering
spaces.
      This required amount of common space shall be established as common open
space under one owner, and provisions shall be established for maintenance and
care. The legal articles relating to any organizations of property owners in
the development charged with such open space maintenance shall be submitted to
the City. The City Council may require as a condition of final approval, any
evidence deemed necessary to document that the required common space shall
remain in its stated condition as long as the development exists, including but
not limited to such legal documents as deed restrictions, conservations,
easements.
      (7)   Clustering Residential Density:
         A.   PUD-RES
To achieve a clustering of residential density and to provide for the required
common open space or public gathering area(s) in a PUD-RES, the lot area
requirements for residential land uses may be reduced by up to twenty percent
(20%) from the highest density residential use regulated under this code at the
time of application for the type of residential use proposed (e.g. single
family, two family or multi-family). The lot width and yard requirements for
residential lots may also be reduced as needed to accommodate a variety of
structural patterns, clustering designs, and housing types.
         B.   PUD-BUS
To achieve a sustainable mix of residential and business uses and public open
spaces, the minimum floor area requirement for multi-family residential land
uses may be reduced by up to 40%.
If the Planning Commission finds that any of the following conditions would be
created by an increase in density, it may then deny or limit any increase in
density by an amount that is sufficient to avoid the creation of any of the
following conditions:
            1.   Congested or unsafe access to the planned development.
            2.   Traffic congestion in the streets which adjoin the planned
development.
            3.   An excessive burden on parks, recreational areas, schools and
other public facilities that serve or are proposed to serve the planned
development.
      (8)   Spacing and Building Height.
         A.   The location of all structures shall be shown on the development
plans. The proposed location, height, and arrangement of structures shall not
be detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent dwellings or to the existing
or prospective development of the neighborhood.
         B.   Minimum lot areas, frontage and yard requirements shall be
discussed with the Planning Commission to ensure that the proposed development
complies with the intent of this Chapter.
      (9)   Peripheral Setbacks. If the Planning Commission determines that
topographical or other barriers do not provide a sufficient buffer between
"PUD" Districts and contiguous land uses to avoid detrimental impact upon the
economic value of the contiguous real estate, the Planning Commission shall
impose either or both of the following requirements:
         A.   Structures and parking areas located on the perimeter of the
residential "PUD" District may be required to be set back by a distance
sufficient to protect against an adverse impact upon the value of contiguous
land.
         B.   Structures located on the perimeter of the residential "PUD"
District may be required to be permanently screened in a manner that is
sufficient to protect against adverse impact on the value of contiguous land.
      (10)   Residential Dwelling Types:
         A.   Along with clustering residential density, a PUD-RES may include
a mixture of dwelling types, including single-family detached dwellings, two-
family units, zero lot line units, and multi-family units, provided the overall
maximum density is not exceeded.
         B.   A PUD-BUS may only include multi-family dwelling units located on
the upper stories of a building.
            (Ord. 2-2013. Passed 7-1-13.)
1169.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REVIEW PROCESS.
   The establishment of a PUD, pursuant to this Chapter, is a four-step
process. It is recommended that the developer or property owner seeking the PUD
meet with the City Administrator to discuss the intent of the PUD prior to
filing application. This conversation shall be non-binding to the application
process. The process is as follows. Application requirements are established in
Section
1169.05.
   (a)   First, a conceptual plan is submitted to the Planning Commission for
review and recommendation to City Council for approval. If this action is
approved by City Council, the official zoning map of the City is amended to
reflect the PUD designation including a number to uniquely identify the PUD
(e.g. PUD-BUS 1, PUD-BUS 2, PUD-RES 3, etc.).
   (b)   Second, the PUD is reviewed by Planning Commission and, if approved,
recommended by Planning Commission to City Council for consideration as a
zoning map amendment pursuant to Chapter
1129, District Changes and Regulation Amendments. The approval or denial of the
establishment of a PUD is a legislative action by the City Council.
   (c)   Third, a Preliminary Development Plan must be reviewed, approved and
recommended by the Planning Commission for action by City Council pursuant to
Section
1169.06 of this Chapter. Action on the Preliminary Plan by City Council is an
administrative act. If approved by City Council, the Preliminary Development
Plan becomes a text amendment to the Zoning Code Appendix with a designation
PUD-RES/BUS (Insert number in sequential order).
   (d)   Fourth, a Final Development Plan must be reviewed and acted on by
Planning Commission pursuant to Section
1169.06 of this Chapter. The Planning Commission's action on a Final
Development Plan is final. Once approved by Planning Commission, the text of
the PUD shall receive the same corresponding unique identification number
stated in
1169.03(a), above. The text shall remain on file as the regulatory language
guiding the development of that PUD.
      (Ord. 2-2013. Passed 7-1-13.)
1169.04 PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL ACTION ON CONCEPT PLAN.
   The Planning Commission shall study the application and Concept Plan and
shall hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days of the time of submission
of a complete application as determined by the Building Official. Following
this public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a report to City
Council within thirty (30) days recommending approval or disapproval and the
reasons therefore. The Planning Commission may explicitly impose special
conditions relating to the Planned Unit Development with regard to type and
extent of public improvements, maintenance of common and public open space, and
any other pertinent development characteristics as needed in making a
determination. The time period for review may be extended if agreed to by the
applicant.
   Action on the Concept Plan by the Planning Commission and City Council shall
be as follows:
   (a)   If, from the facts presented, the Planning Commission or City Council
is unable to make the necessary findings specified in this Chapter, the
application shall be denied or returned to the applicant for clarification. In
taking action, the Planning Commission and/or Council may deny the Concept Plan
or may recommend approval of said plan subject to specified amendments.
If the application is approved by the Planning Commission and City Council, the
approval of the Concept Plan shall be limited to the general acceptability of
the proposed land uses, density levels and their interrelationship, and shall

1175.01 INTENT.
   (a)    Sign regulations, including provisions to control the type, design,
size, location, illumination and maintenance thereof, are established in order
to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
      (1)   To promote attractive and maintain high value residential districts
by permitting only nameplates, bulletin boards and signs related to the
development, rental or sale of properties in such districts;
         (2)   To provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for
identifying and advertising goods sold or services rendered in business
districts by regulating the size, type and design of signs to the type and size
of establishments;
      (3)   To provide for appropriate signs for the identification and
preservation of commercial and industrial development;
      (4)   To control the design of signs so that their appearance will be
aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings and the overall design for the
area;
      (5)   To reduce traffic hazards by restricting signs which exceed the
viewers’ capacity to receive information or which increase the probability of
accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision;
      (6)   In establishing these objectives the City has determined that,
without adequate regulation and design standards, signs are a nuisance. The
number of signs in North College Hill is unduly distracting, and in some cases
reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. Therefore, the
number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs permitted should
comply with the standards of the chapter in order to reduce the aforementioned
effects.
   (b)    The signs of least value to the people of North College Hill are
those which carry commercial messages other than the advertisement of any
product, service, event, person, institution, or business located on the
premises where the sign is located.
   (c)    Except as provided herein, all signs not conforming to the provisions
of this chapter are hereby declared a nuisance. It is further declared that the
regulations contained in this chapter are the minimum regulations necessary to
abate the nuisance and to achieve the purpose of this chapter.
   (d)    Signs shall be designed, erected, altered, moved, displayed and
maintained in accordance with the regulations set forth in this Chapter. The
provisions of the Chapter shall not amend or in any way interfere with the
other codes, rules or regulations governing traffic signs within the City.

1189.01 AVERAGE DEPTH OF FRONT YARDS.
   In the R-District, where the average depth of at least two existing front
yards on lots within 100 feet of the lot in question and within the same block-
front is less or greater than the least front yard depth prescribed elsewhere
in this Zoning Ordinance, the required depth of the front yard on such lot
shall be modified. In such case, this shall not be less than the average of the
depth on the two lots immediately adjoining, or, in the case where there are no
buildings on both of the lots immediately adjoining, the average depth of the
front yards on lots within the same block front; provided, however, that the
depth of a front yard on any lot shall be at least ten feet and need not exceed
fifty feet.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3- 24- 69.)
1189.02 STEEP SLOPES; FRONT YARD GARAGE OR PARKING AREA.
   In the R-District, where the natural slope of a lot within the required
front yard has an average slope, normal to the front lot line at every point
along such line, of such a degree or percent of slope that it is not
practicable to provide a driveway with a grade of twelve percent or less to a
private garage or parking area conforming with the requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance, such garage or parking area may be located within such front yard,
but not in any case closer than six feet from the front lot line.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1189.03 DOUBLE FRONTAGE LOTS.
   Buildings on lots having frontage on two nonintersecting streets need not
have a rear yard, if an equivalent open space is provided on the lot in lieu of
such required rear yard; applicable front yards must be provided, however, on
both streets.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1189.04 REAR AND SIDE YARD COMPUTATION.
   In computing the depth of a rear yard or the width of a side yard, where the
rear or side yard abuts an alley, one-half of the width of the alley may be
included as a portion of the required rear or side yard, as the case may be;
provided, however, that no side yard shall be less at any point than three
feet, and no rear yard less than ten feet, exclusive of any alley.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1189.05 SIDE YARD MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Side Yard Increased. Each side yard, where required, shall be
increased in width by one inch for each foot by which the length of the side
wall of the building, adjacent to the side yard, exceeds fifty feet.
   (b)    Side Yard Varied; Wall Not Parallel. Side yard width may be varied
where the side wall of a building is not parallel with the side lot line or is
broken or otherwise irregular. In such case, the average width of the side yard
shall not be less than the otherwise required least width; provided, however,
that such side yard shall not be narrower at any point than one-half the
otherwise required least width, or narrower than three feet in any case.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1189.06 REAR AND SIDE YARDS REDUCED.
   Depth of a rear yard or width of each side yard for a one-family or two-
family dwelling may be reduced by four inches and two inches respectively, for
each foot by which a lot at the time of enactment of this Zoning Ordinance is
less than 100 feet deep or less than fifty feet wide; provided, however, that
no such side yard shall be less at any point than three feet, or, in the case
of such side yard along a side street lot line, less than five feet; and
further provided that no such rear yard shall be less than ten feet. The width
of one side yard may be reduced when authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals,
in the case of a one-family or two-family dwelling, to a width of not less than
three feet, provided the sum of the widths of the two side yards is not less
than the required minimum, and provided the distance between the proposed
dwelling and another dwelling, existing or proposed, on an adjacent lot is not
less than the required minimum sum of the widths of two side yards; provided,
however, that such reduction may be authorized only when the Board finds it
warranted by the location of existing buildings or conducive to the desirable
development of two or more lots.
(Ord. 1-1969. Passed 3-24-69.)
1189.07 TRAFFIC VISIBILITY ACROSS CORNER LOTS.
   A modification of yard requirements under the provisions of this chapter
shall not be permitted in any R-District on any corner lot which could result
in the erection or maintenance of a structure within twenty feet of the corner,
the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines, which interferes with
traffic visibility across the corner.

   (a)    It is hereby found and determined that there may exist within the
City blighted, deteriorating, deteriorated or underutilized areas of the nature
defined in this chapter which constitute a serious and growing menace injurious

residents and occupants thereof; that the existence of such areas:
      (1)    Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of
disease and crime, and to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive

adequate police, fire and accident protection and for other public services and
facilities; or
      (2)    Constitutes an economic and social liability; or

community; that this menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and exercise by the police power, and cannot be dealt with
effectively by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids
herein provided; that the elimination by the City, in whole or in part, of
blighted or underutilized and deteriorating areas by urban renewal as defined

   If the owner of property in an urban renewal area is willing to make the use
of his property conform to the urban renewal plan and the Mayor is of the
opinion that the acquisition of such owner's property will not be necessary to
carry out the urban renewal plan if the owner makes his property conform to the
urban renewal plan, then in such case the Mayor, in lieu of acquiring such
property may, on behalf of the City, enter into an agreement with such owner in
which the owner agrees to conform his land, the structures thereon and the use
thereof to the urban renewal plan within the time set forth in the agreement.
The Mayor may require as a condition to enter into such an agreement that the
owner furnish such security for the performance of his obligations under the
agreement as the Mayor believes is necessary in order to protect the interests
of the City.
(Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)
1195.10 MODIFICATIONS OF URBAN RENEWAL PLAN; HEARING.
   (a)    The Mayor or any person interested may petition Council to modify the
urban renewal plan adopted for a project area. Such petition shall be in
writing and shall state in detail the modification desired. Upon receipt of
such petition, Council shall refer the same to the Planning Commission for its
recommendation. The Commission shall review such modifications and return the
petition to Council, together with its recommendations.
   (b)    In the event the proposed modification contemplates an extension of
the project area, the addition of a new type of urban renewal activity which
requires the acquisition of property, or a change in zoning within the area,
Council shall, before considering it, hold a public hearing thereon, at which
an opportunity shall be provided for all persons interested to be heard, either
in person or by counsel. Notice of such hearing shall be given in the manner
prescribed in Section
1195.06. Council may either approve or reject the proposed modification by a
majority vote. If the proposed modification is adopted by Council, it shall
become part of the urban renewal plan,
(Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)

   (a)    The Mayor or the City's agent, with Council approval, is hereby
authorized to negotiate for the sale of property in a project area which is not
to be retained by the City for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan.
In connection therewith the Mayor is hereby authorized to enter into necessary
appraisal and market analysis contracts. No land shall be sold by the Mayor
except pursuant to a special ordinance of Council authorizing such sale, which
ordinance shall prescribe in detail the terms and conditions upon which such
sale is to be made and the covenants to be contained in the deed from the City
to the redeveloper.
   (b)    Pending the use or sale of the property in a project area it may be
temporarily rented for such use and purposes as may be desirable, even though
not in conformity with the urban renewal plan.
(Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)

covenant or covenants prohibiting the restriction of the sale or use of such
property on the basis of race, religion or any other standard that is not
applicable to all persons or families irrespective of race, religion or
ancestry.
(Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)
BLIGHT ELIMINATION
1195.20 LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   (a)    It is hereby found and determined that there exists within the City
premises that by reason of age, obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack
of maintenance or repair or a combination thereof constitute a blight and a
nuisance upon the surrounding neighborhood because they are fire hazards,
health hazards, places of retreat for immoral or criminal purposes or for the
breach of the public peace, substantial and unreasonable interference with the
reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises in the neighborhood,
or factors seriously depreciating property values in the area
   (b)    It is further found that programs aimed at specific elimination of
the particular blights or nuisances involved in neighborhoods of the City have
sometimes proven inadequate or ineffective, have sometimes failed to prevent
recurrence of blight and have sometimes resulted merely in the alteration of
the nature or form of the nuisance or blight that previously existed. It is
further found that it therefore becomes necessary in order to eliminate
nuisance and blight and to prevent recurrence of blight on the premises for the
City to obtain the title of the blighted premises and to take direct action to
remove or remedy the blight or provide for its removal by others and to make
further provisions for future development, redevelopment or use of the premises
in such a way as to prevent any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the
premises.
   (c)    It is further found and determined that acquisition of such blighted
property by the City in order to eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent
its recurrence constitutes a public purpose.
(Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)
1195.21 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of Sections
1195.20 through
1195.30 the words and phrases defined herein shall have the meaning
respectively ascribed to them, unless a different meaning is clearly indicated
in the context.
   (a)    "Blighted premises" means premises which because of their age,
obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance, or repair or
any serious combination thereof constitute a fire hazard, a serious health
hazard, a substantial and unreasonable interference with the reasonable and
lawful use and enjoyment of other premises within the neighborhoods or a factor
seriously depreciating property values in the neighborhood.
   (b)    "Neighborhood" means an area of the City comprised of all premises or
parcels of land which in whole or in part are located within a radius of 500
feet of any one parcel or lot within the City.
   (c)    "Redevelopment" means the acquisition of blighted premises, the
demolition of a structure or structures thereon, the making of site
improvements, including the construction or reconstruction of structures
thereon, or the sale of property for use in accordance with the Zoning or
Building Code of the City. Redevelopment may include the construction or
improvement by the City of any buildings for public use or resale by private
persons.
   (d)    "Rehabilitation" means the restoration, rehabilitation or
conservation of blighted premises by improvement, modernization or repair of a
structure or structures thereon to bring it into conformance with applicable
building and zoning provisions of the City.
      (Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)
1195.22 DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   (a)    The Mayor shall present to Council, from time to time, a report which
shall list therein the location and ownership of premises which he has reason
to believe are blighted premises as defined in Section
1195.21(a) and which are located in the City outside of urban renewal areas or
"blighted areas" as defined in this chapter. The report shall state briefly the
factors which in the Mayor's opinion, would warrant the determination that the
premises so listed on the report are blighted. The premises so listed on the
report shall be only those blighted premises which, in the opinion of the
Mayor, are such that, in order to eliminate the existing blight and to prevent
further blight, acquisition therefor shall be necessary for one or more of the
following reasons:
      (1)    The owner of the premises cannot or will not:
         A.    Eliminate the blighted condition; and/or
         B.    Prevent recurrence of the blight; or
      (2)    The owner has not responded to a lawful order by the City for such
owner to take action to eliminate its recurrence within thirty days after due
notice of the request or order has been given him by:
         A.    Posting such order or notice on the premises;
         B.    Personal delivery; or
         C.    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the
owner; or
         D.    Publishing once a week for three consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation a notice of the issuance of the order relating
to the premises and directing the owner to contact the Mayor in regard to such
order; and
      (3)    Direct action, short of acquisition by the City to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,
demolition, or blighted structures, or barricading such structure has proved to
be unsuccessful:
         A.    To eliminate the blight; or
         B.    To prevent its recurrence; or
      (4)    In the opinion of the Mayor, based upon conditions existing on the
premises and in the neighborhood, such direct action would be likely to prove
inadequate to eliminate blight or prevent the recurrence.
         (Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)
1195.23 PUBLIC HEARING.
   (a)    Upon receipt of a report from the Mayor, Council shall set a date for
public hearing in regard to the existence of blight on the premises and
necessity for acquisition by the City in order to eliminate blight and to
prevent the recurrence thereof. Upon the fixing of a day for a public hearing,
the Clerk of Council shall promptly cause notice to be given to the owner or
owners of record of the premises and the occupants thereof, if any, or the
person in charge of such premises, if any, notifying them of the time and the
place of the hearing and apprising them of their right to appear at such
hearing to show cause why the premises should be declared to be blighted or why
the City should not acquire such premises for the purpose of eliminating blight
thereon and preventing the recurrence of blight. Notice of such hearing shall
be given by:
      (1)    Posting the notice thereof on the premises; or
      (2)    Personal service; or
      (3)    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address of the
owner or person in charge of the premises or to the occupants thereof; or
      (4)    Publishing the notice once a week for three consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City.
         (Ord. 10-1990. Passed 5-21-90.)
1195.24 PROCEDURE.
   (a)    At the hearing required by Section
1195.23, the report of the Mayor shall be read and shall constitute prima-facie
evidence of blight on the premises and need for the City to acquire such
premises in order to eliminate the blight and prevent recurrence of blight
thereon. Thereafter, the owner, person in charge, occupant of the premises or
any person having an interest therein may proceed to show cause why the
premises should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire such
premises for the purposes of eliminating blight or prevent its recurrence. At
the hearing, the owner, person in charge of the premises or occupant may cause
to be presented to Council any records of the City pertaining to issues
relevant to the hearing and may examine City employees in regard thereto,
provided that the production of such records or the presence of such employees
is requested by the owner, person in charge or occupant of the premises in
writing at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing.
   (b)    If the owner, person in charge or occupant of the premises does not
appear and presents testimony for the purpose of showing cause why the premises
should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire the premises for
the purpose of eliminating the blight and preventing recurrence of blight, the
Mayor, or his duly appointed representative, shall proceed to present evidence
to Council of the existence of blight on the premises and the need to acquire
the premise for elimination of the blight and the prevention of recurrence of
the blight thereon. Members of the public residing in the neighborhood or who
may otherwise have knowledge of the condition of such premises may address
Council at the hearing in regard to the proposed action of the City.
   (c)    Council may adjourn the hearing from time to time, and grant
continuances to the Mayor or his representative or the owner in charge or
occupant of the premises, in order for them to present further argument or
evidence in regard to the existence of blight on the premises or the need for
the City to acquire such premises in order to eliminate blight or prevent the
recurrence of blight thereon.

VACANT/FORECLOSED PROPERTY REGISTRATION
1195.31 FINDINGS.
   (a)   Whereas it is hereby found and determined that insufficient vacant
property guidelines, can pose a danger to the public health, safety and welfare
of families and communities. Several studies have determined that vacant and
foreclosed properties can quickly become blighted properties. Moreover, vacant
and foreclosed properties are at greater risk of becoming abandoned properties
than other properties in the City. Locating the person in control of the
property or responsible for the care and maintenance of the property is often
an impossible task, mired in disputes between the mortgagee, mortgagor,
servicer and sub servicer. Accordingly, citations and invoices for property
maintenance are routinely ignored at these properties which place these
properties at increased risk for becoming unsecured, vandalized and hazardous.
These properties are also responsible for thousands of dollars of unpaid
invoices due to the City of North College Hill for maintaining these
properties.
   (b)   The purpose of this ordinance is to ensure that vacant and foreclosed
properties are protected and maintained and the city officials are alerted to
the location of these vulnerable properties in a timely manner. This ordinance
is enacted in order to address the problem of blighted properties that are a
direct result of vacant and foreclosed properties and that pose a threat to the
public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. 17-2017. Passed 11-20-17.)
1195.32 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Vacant Property. Any vacant building not involved in a foreclosure;
any vacant building that is in a standard condition; a vacant building that is
in a substandard condition, but is suitable for rehabilitation; or a building
that has been vacant for more than one hundred
and twenty days.
   (b)   Foreclosed Property. Any property that is involved in a procedure by
which a party who has loaned money secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on
real property (or has an unpaid judgement), forces the sale of the real
property to recover the money due, unpaid interest, plus the cost of
foreclosure, after the debtor fails to make payment.
   (c)   Owner. Any person, agent, operator, firm or corporation having a legal
or equitable interest in the property, or recorded in the official records of
the state, county or municipality as hold title to the property; or otherwise
having control of the property, including the guardian of the estate of any
such person, and executor or administrator of
the estate of such person if ordered to take possession of real property by a
court.
(Ord. 17-2017. Passed 11-20-17.)
1195.33 POINT OF SALE INSPECTION ON VACANT AND FORECLOSED PROPERTIES
   (a)   Point of sale inspections are hereby authorized on all properties that
are subject to vacant, foreclosed property registration. Mortgagees and
property owners shall arrange to have all properties subject to the
requirements of this Ordinance inspected by the code official within five days
of filing for the property to be sold. If the mortgagees or property owner
fails to arrange an inspection, the property shall be inspected by the code
official prior to the property being sold at a judicial sale or pursuant to a
search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (b)   If as a result of the above inspection, the code official determines
that health code violations, property maintenance code violations, hazards or
structural defects exist on the property; the code official shall notify the
City Administration of the conditions. The City Administration shall provide
written notice via certified mail to the mortgagee or the mortgagee's agent
listed on the vacant foreclosed registration form, the owner of record
and any equitable lien holders, informing the parties of the following:
      (1)   The need to repair and correct the violations, hazards or
structural defects prior to judicial sale:
      (2)   If the property is not brought into compliance within thirty days
of the issuance of the notice of violation, the code official may correct or
repair some or all of the violations:
      (3)   If the code official corrects or repairs some or all of the
violations, the City Administration shall promptly place a priority lien on the
property for the total cost of abating the violations. The City Administration
shall collect the priority lien from the proceeds of the judicial sale of the
property, or upon subsequent sale of the property, or by methods provided in
ORC 715.261. When notice is given as provided for in the section, the lien
shall be a priority over liens of prior record and the lien will be effective
on the date the City incurs the cost of the repairs.
   (c)   Property subject to the requirements of this Ordinance shall not be
re-occupied without a Certificate of Occupancy from the North College Hill

requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1309.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.   
   Article XVIII, Section
3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt
land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of North College
Hill, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows. (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of North College Hill has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
(Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.03  PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of North College Hill as identified in Section
1309.06 including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of North College Hill.
(Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study for Hamilton County, Ohio and incorporated
areas dated May 17, 2004. Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Hamilton County, Ohio
and incorporated areas dated May 17, 2004.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of North College Hill as required by Section 
1309.13 (c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the City Hall, 1646 W. Galbraith Road, North
College Hill, Ohio 45239.
(Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not to repeal any existing ordinances including
subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant
or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by
the regulations. (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations. (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of North College Hill, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-
04.)
1309.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal. A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or

chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,

filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100- year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than I square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 1 foot feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U. S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of North College Hil1 whose historic preservation program has been
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMP). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal govemment that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of North College
Hill Flood Insurance Rate Map dated September 29, 1986, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
govemments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction;"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation . The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.12 ADMINISTRATION.

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of North College Hill flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1309.06  accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1309.13 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and
proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by more than one
foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Nonh College Hill, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of North College Hill have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of North College Hill Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
North College Hill boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map
of the City of North College Hill suitable for reproduction, clearly showing
the new corporate limits or the new area for which the City of North College
Hill has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1309.14 .
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1309.12 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of North College Hill and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
nnust be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of North College Hill specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.12 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-04.)
1309.14 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board and Variance Procedure.
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by Chapter
1127 of Codified Ordinances of the City of North College Hill shall hear and
decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
   (b)   Variances.   
      (1)   Any person believing that the use and development standards of
these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application
for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (2)   In considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board shall
consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following
factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects af wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   The Building Commissioner shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
   (c)   Variance Conditions.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (b)(2) A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
   (d)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Hamilton Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 8-2004. Passed 5-3-
04.)

without footings and with the bottom of the wall at the same level as the
bottom of the retaining slab.
         B.    Low retaining walls (up to four feet high), adjacent to and
retained by hard-surfaced paving at the front of the wall, may be built with
the bottom of the retaining wall at one foot six inches below the finished
grade at the front of the wall.
         C.    All other retaining walls shall be built with the bottom of the
footings at least two feet six inches below the finished grade at the front of
the wall.
         D.    In lieu of engineered design, gravity walls, with level backfill
and level grade at the front of the wall shall have a minimum width at the top
of eight inches if of poured concrete or twelve inches if of brick, solid
concrete block or stone. At any point along the height of the wall, the

the distance if the wall is brick, solid concrete block, stone.
         E.    Unengineered hollow concrete block walls shall not be permitted
for the construction of curb walls or retaining walls.
         F.    A granular backfill shall be placed behind the wall at an
elevation coinciding with the finished grade in front of the wall extending to
within eight inches of the top of the wall. This backfill shall be at least
twelve inches thick against the back of the retaining wall. Earth backfill
shall be carefully placed behind this granular backfill; the granular backfill
shall be made sufficiently wide to assure a full twelve inches thick drainage
strata.
         G.    Provisions for drainage of the backfill shall be made either by
means of weep holes (four inch diameter maximum six inches o.c.) in the wall or
with a system of perforated pipe of four inch minimum diameter laid at the base
of the backfill and having a proper gradient to an outlet.

the yard shall require a continuous durable handrail on at least one side where
the vertical rise of the stair exceeds thirty inches or contains more than
three risers.
         (Ord. 26-1989. Passed 12-18-89.)
1313.04 GRADING AND DRAINAGE.
   (a)    Grading.
      (1)    The site plan submitted for the building shall show, in addition
to all proposed improvements, all revisions being made to the site which are
not in accord with the approved and executed grading plan for the subdivision.
This shall include field verified grade elevations of existing conditions.
      (2)    When a lot is graded to higher or lower level than the existing
grade, the owner shall provide slopes (max. 3: 1), retaining wall, or other
approved protection, on his property, to preserve the elevation of the
adjoining property. Steeper slopes may be approved in special limited cases.
      (3)    Finished grade immediately adjacent to the building shall be
graded downward away from the building at a minimum slope of five percent (5%)
(five-eighths inch in twelve inches) for a distance not to exceed one-half of
the side yard (ten feet maximum).
      (4)    All parts of the grading and drainage systems shall satisfy the
requirements of the City Engineer and the Building Department.
         A.    Grading shall be done so that the drainage pattern (in place or
approved) is not changed, and storm water ground run-off to adjoining property
is not increased, re-directed, concentrated or caused to spill off the property
in new locations, so as to create storm water problems on adjacent property.
         B.    Storm water shall be directed into the same watershed and in the
same general direction that existed prior to the site grading operation.
Diversion into other watersheds is not permitted, except when approved for very
minor grading areas occurring totally within the newly developed lot, and then
only when no problems will be created on adjacent property.
      (5)    All applicable requirements of the grading and drainage
regulations of the various agencies shall be complied with before a Certificate
of Occupancy shall be issued.
         A.    Work which is executed but is not in conformance with the
regulations and/or the approved site plan, shall be removed and remedial action
taken to bring the property into full compliance.
   (b)    Drainage. The storm drainage system on each lot shall comply with the
above and shall include, but is not limited to the following:
      (1)    An approved surface and/or sub-surface drainage system for the
collection and disposal of storm runoff and sub-surface water from the site to
prevent flooding, erosion and standing water. Concentrate storm drainage flow
shall be directed to approved surface and/or sub-surface drainage facilities as
required herein.
      (2)    The drainage system shall carry and discharge storm water without
producing any adverse effect on adjacent or immediate downstream properties.
Retention facilities shall be provided, as required by the City Engineer to
facilitate the containment and slow release of storm run-off.
      (3)    The choice of outflow facilities lies with the property owner, but
shall be approved by the City, which reserves the right to require use of
another facility. Such facilities shall include, but are not limited to:
         A.    Existing surface and piped facilities, such as swales,
watercourses, drainage easements, storm sewers, etc. as regulated by the City
Engineer.
            1.    Use of storm sewers shall be approved, in concept, by the
Department of Public Works, and no such sewer shall be considered available
unless it is low enough to allow the slope of the lateral entering it to meet
the requirements of the storm drainage system regulations.
            2.    The storm or combined sewer shall be considered available
only if the braking or cutting of the flat paving in the public right-of-way,
or if the tunneling under the street to access the sewer is fully approved by
the agency regulating the roadway.
         B.    Street drainage ditches and street gutters, via an outflow pipe
(through the curb, where applicable) as regulated within the public right-of-
way by the City Engineer.
      (4)    Surface drainage. Positive surface drainage shall be provided for
each lot so there is no pocketing of water on any surface. This can be
accomplished by grading or installing catch basins, area drains, underdrains,
etc. properly connected to approved disposal facilities.
         A.    Grading shall be done so that the existing natural ground
drainage of the areas is not impeded, distorted or redirected.
      (5)    Yard drainage. Where no storm or combined sewer is available, no
garage apron, driveway, stairwell, window (area) well, foundation drain,
walkway, below-grade entrance area, or any below-grade area subject to
receiving storm drainage shall be permitted unless it has a gravity drainage
system or an approved sump well and pump installation.
         A.    Outflow shall comply with subsection (b)(3) hereof, except that
no clear water sump discharge shall be permitted into a street gutter.
      (6)    Building drainage. All building surfaces which collect and drain
storm water shall have slopes, drains, gutters and downspouts, or other such
facilities, installed in full accord with the Ohio Plumbing Code, and Chapter
20 of the Hamilton County Building Code. All parts and devices of such
collection system shall be connected to the drainage system as prescribed in
the Plumbing Code and the storm water therein shall be carried to proper
outflow facilities, as required by subsection (b)(3) hereof.
         A.    Gutters and downspouts, for one and two family dwellings, shall
be provided in sheet metal material, at the rate of one downspout and necessary
guttering for each 400 square feet, or fraction thereof, of horizontal building
area under each roof surface.
Downspouts shall be connected to the drainage system, as regulated by the
Plumbing Code, as the first joint above the grade.
         B.    All other buildings shall be regulated by the OBBC.
      (7)    All projects shall be planned, designed and executed to utilize
proper drainage equipment, techniques and facilities. Plans submitted for
review must accurately show all existing and proposed storm drainage system
features, including downspouts, leader lines, grading, elevations (grades),
swales, easements, outflow, etc. Additional information may be required as
necessary for complete review.
         A.    Drainage piping subjected to traffic loads under private roads,
driveways, etc. shall be heavy-gauge corrugated metal, concrete, reinforced
concrete, ADS plastic, PVC Schedule 40 or metal, as per State of Ohio DOT
specifications. Earth cover over such piping shall be a minimum of one inch to
six inches thick.
      (8)    Work executed at variance with stated rules and regulations or the
approved drawings shall be removed and/or re-worked to meet the requirements
applicable.
      (9)    When operation of drainage system or pattern is in doubt, drainage
to any means of disposal shall be dye-tested to insure proper function.
Such testing shall be accomplished by the general (prime) contractor or owner,
in the presence of the appropriate inspector(s), and compliance with the
applicable regulations shall be achieved prior to the issuance of the
Certificate of Occupancy.
   (c)    Application for a permit of any new building shall be accompanied by
the required number of site surveys of the property, prepared by a registered
surveyor. This shall show, in addition to the lot location, bounds and building
location on the lot etc., the following information:
      (1)    Type of sewer (such as storm, sanitary, combined), material and
size of the sewer, sea level elevations of sewer inverts at location of
laterals, inlets, outlets, catch basins, manholes (when sewer is to be
utilized); the proposed floor level of the lowest floor (including basement or
cellar) of building;
      (2)    Accurate, field-verified, sea level elevations of existing grades;
proposed final grades of yard to determine compliance with this section;
      (3)    Drainage pattern and/or facilities that are available for use or
which are to be constructed (See subsection (b)(7) hereof);
      (4)    Where project is to be placed between two closely adjacent
buildings, or on a large isolated lot, or where no subdivision grading plan is
available, an expanded site survey is required. This survey shall accurately
show all existing buildings, elevations, drainage facilities, and drainage
patterns on the site and on adjacent property within fifty feet (minimum) of
the new building, or at an additional distance as necessary for complete
review. This plan shall show all existing and proposed elevations and elements
of the drainage system which shall be reviewed for approval in light of the
surrounding properties and their drainage facilities, patterns, and
requirements.
         (Ord. 26-1989. Passed 12-18-89.)
1313.05 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION.
   The National Flood Insurance Program and the City operate a flood plain
management program through the adoption of Flood Damage Prevention Regulations.
A part of the flood plain management system requires control of building
construction in flood-prone areas as follows:
      (a)    Projects regulated by the State-adopted OBBC shall be documented,
using such standards as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers booklet Flood Proofing
Regulations-72 (a technical guide cited in Appendix B of the OBBC which
delineates design data for the flood-proofing of structures) as required in
provisions of the OBBC and as set forth in this section.
      (b)    Within any Special Flood Hazard Area as identified in Section 3.2

1315.05 RIGHT TO MAKE IMMEDIATE REPAIRS.
   (a)   Upon being served notice, the owner may make immediate application in
writing or in person to the Building Commissioner for a special building permit
to undertake the repairs or replacement of items found to constitute a public
nuisance.
   (b)   Adequate plans and specifications as required by the Building
Commissioner, covering the repairs or replacements shall be furnished by the
owner to the Building Commissioner within fifteen days after receipt of notice
or such additional time as the Building Commissioner may deem necessary to
complete plans and specifications not to exceed ninety days. The Building
Commissioner shall upon approval of the plans and specifications cause a
special building permit to be issued to the owner. The special building permit
to be issued by the Building Commissioner shall be for a period of thirty days
and within the thirty days the owner shall effect and complete the repairs or
replacements, or the Building Commissioner may grant an extension to the
special building permit if the owner shows reason or cause for the request
extension and which extension shall more readily effect the repairs or
replacement with respect to the existence of a public nuisance, and stating
that unless the owner thereof shall cause the abatement of a public nuisance by
rehabilitation or by removal of the building or structure the same shall be
abated by the City at the expense of the owner. Such abatement shall start
within fifteen days after service of the notice and shall be complete within
forty-five days or such additional time as the Building Commissioner may deem
necessary to complete the abatement. (Ord. 16-2012. Passed 9-7-12.)
1315.06 APPEAL.
   The owner may within ten days after completion of service of the notice,
make a demand in writing to the Building Commissioner for a hearing on the
question of whether in fact a public nuisance exists. The hearing shall be held
within ten days following receipt of the written demand and at least two days’
notice in writing of the hearing shall be given to the owner. The hearing shall
be conducted by a Hearing Board composed of the Mayor, the Fire Chief, the
Building Commissioner, Building Inspector and the Law Director or in the event
any of the officers are unable to attend, by someone from their respective
department delegated by them to act in their behalf. All members of the Hearing
Board shall concur that a public nuisance exists before enforcement of the
abatement is carried out. A copy of the decision of the hearing officers shall
be promptly served upon the owner in the manner provided for in Section
1315.03. (Ord. 16-2012. Passed 9-7-12.)
1315.07 ABATEMENT BY BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   Should the nuisance not be abated at the expiration time stated in the
notice or expiration of the time stated in the special building permit issued
by the Building Commissioner or such additional time as the Hearing Board may
grant, the Building Commissioner shall be authorized, at any time thereafter to
enter upon the premises and the owner shall permit him entry to abate the
nuisance by demolition and removal of the structure or by taking any other such
action as may be required.
   (b)   In abating such nuisance, the Building Commissioner may call upon any
department, division or bureau of the City for whatever assistance may be
necessary; or may, by private contract, obtain the abatement thereof, and the
cost of such private contract shall be paid from City funds specifically
authorized by Council in order to abate such public nuisance.
   (c)   In abating such nuisance, the Building Commissioner may go to whatever
extent necessary to complete the abatement of the same and the cost of the
abatement action shall be recovered from the owner in the following procedure:
      (1)   The owner or owners shall be billed directly by certified mail for
the cost of the abatement. The bill for the cost of the abatement shall be paid
within sixty days after receipt of the bill.
      (2)   If costs are not so recovered, then the City shall cause the cost
of the abatement to be levied as an assessment and recovered in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.261.
         (Ord. 16-2012. Passed 9-7-12.)
1315.08 REPEAT OFFENDERS.
   (a)   It is the intent of the City Council, in adopting this section, to
impose on and collect from the owner of a nuisance property the cost for law
enforcement and other services, which are over and above the cost of providing
normal law enforcement and other services City-wide, if the said excess costs
are spent to respond to and/or abate a public nuisance which has occurred, or
is maintained and permitted, on the nuisance property.
   (b)   If a premises has been declared a nuisance property within the past
twelve months, and pursuant to this chapter a new, continuing or recurring
public nuisance is found to exist, notice shall be served on the owner
indicating the intent of the Building Commissioner to certify the costs of
responding to and abating the public nuisance. However, if the owner was
previously put on notice of the public nuisance at issue, notice of intent to
certify costs will not be served until the thirty day time period, or other
time period as determined by the City, to abate the public nuisance has
expired. Notice of intent to certify costs shall be served at least thirty days
before such certification occurs.
   (c)   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice of intent to
certify costs may within ten days after completion of service of such notice
ask the Building Commissioner in writing for reconsideration of the intended
certification of costs. If the Building Commissioner finds that the facts
presented do not support the finding of a nuisance, the Inspector shall rescind
the notice. Otherwise, the Inspector shall refer the appeal for hearing by a
Hearing Board composed of the Mayor, the Fire Chief, the Building Commissioner,
Building Inspector, and the Law Director or in the event any of the officers
are unable to attend, by someone from their respective department delegated by
them to act in their behalf. Action by the City to abate the nuisance shall not
be stayed by such appeal. If on appeal any of the following situations is
proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the costs of abatement shall not be
certified and imposed on the owner:
      (1)   The present owner was not the owner at the time of either of the
public nuisances that prompted the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property.
      (2)   The present owner was not the owner at the time of the public
nuisance that prompted the current declaration of a nuisance.
      (3)   The owner had no knowledge of the public nuisance, and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the public nuisance, and upon
receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, the owner promptly took all actions necessary and reasonable to abate
the public nuisance.
   (d)   The costs for responding to and abating a public nuisance shall
include, but are not limited to, the gross salaries and benefits paid by the
City to persons responding to and/or abating the public nuisance; pro rata
costs for all equipment, including vehicles, used to respond to and/or abate
the public nuisance; the costs of any administrative services used to assist in
responding to and/or abating the public nuisance; the costs of repairs to any
equipment or property damaged in responding to and/or abating the public
nuisance; and the cost of any medical treatment of persons employed by the City
who were injured while responding to and/or abating the public nuisance.
   (e)   The costs for responding to and abating a public nuisance at or
related to a nuisance property shall be recovered from the owner in the
following procedure:
      (1)   The owner or owners shall be billed directly by certified mail. The
bill shall be paid within sixty days after the receipt of the bill.
      (2)   If costs are not so recovered then the City shall cause the costs
to be levied as an assessment and recovered in accordance with Ohio R.C.
715.261. The City reserves its right to seek reimbursement for costs and
damages not recovered by assessment against the property through other legal
remedies or procedures.
         (Ord. 16-2012. Passed 9-7-12.)
1315.09 PROVISIONS NOT EXCLUSIVE.
