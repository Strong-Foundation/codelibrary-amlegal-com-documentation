EDITOR'S NOTE
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three

subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)

of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

to any meeting of Council.
Unless the reading of the minutes of a Council meeting is requested by a member
of Council or the Mayor such minutes may be approved without reading.
      (7)   Receiving motion when question is before Council. When a question
or a proposition is before the Council or under debate or when a motion has
been made no motion shall be received except the following:
         A.   To adjourn (not debatable)
         B.   To table a motion - lay it aside until later (not debatable)

considered be voted on - previous question as it is usually called (not

         E.   To refer the proposal to a standing or special committee
         F.   To amend the main motion
         G.   To postpone any action for an indefinite time
      (8)   Motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider a subject That may
have been acted upon favorably must be made before adjournment of that session
of Council; a motion to reconsider any other subject may be made not later than
two regular meetings after such action was taken. A motion to reconsider may be
made only by any member who voted with the winning or prevailing side. A motion
to reconsider shall be in order at any time except when a motion on some other
subject is standing.
A motion to reconsider being laid on the table may be taken up and acted upon
at any time when the Council is engaged in the transaction of new or
miscellaneous business.
No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on any matter or subject
and the same number of votes shall be required to reconsider the action of
Council as was required to have passed or adopt the same.
      (9)   Motion to take from the table. A motion to take from the table
shall be in order when the order of business is being transacted in which such

indefinite be carried the principal question shall be declared lost.
      (11)   Motion for the previous question. The previous question shall be
in the form "shall the main question now be put?" It shall be admitted only
when demanded by two members and until decided shall preclude further debate on
all amendments and motions. If the previous question is demanded on an
amendment, if the motion for the previous question is carried the question
shall be put without further debate.
However, if the motion for the previous question is carried but before it is
actually put into execution the motion to which it is directed may be laid on
the table.
The requirement that two members must be in favor of a motion for the previous
question may be altered as desired by Council. The reason for requiring more
than one member to be in favor of the motion before it is submitted for vote is
the consideration and discussion of a question should not be stopped only by
one member. Of course, the motion for the previous question may be defeated if
it consumes additional time. If more than one member is in favor of the motion
for the previous question there is then more reason for submitting the motion
of the members for action.
      (12)   Motion to amend. A motion to amend may be amended only once. An
amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the same form.
      (13)   Motions on questions of privilege. Questions of privilege shall be

individually and in their capacity as such members. A question of privilege
shall have precedents over all questions except a motion to adjourn.

be applicable. All such meetings of the standing committees of Council shall be
open to the public.

      (6)    Sick leave from another public employer may be carried over upon
receipt of confirmation of balance from the previous employer. Employees shall
be eligible to use carried-over sick leave on the first of the month following
the month of employment. Such sick leave carried over from another employer

      (7)    Unused sick leave shall be accumulated up to an unlimited number
of hours, except for Sick Leave Conversion, as hereinafter provided.
      (8)    Employees may use sick leave, upon approval of the immediate

         B.   Injury of the Employee, except when an Employee is a member of a

Immediate Family is defined as a spouse residing in the Employee’s household

service to the City, death, or disability, as provided herein.

an appropriate Police and Fireman’s Pension Plan and program of this State for
full-time employees.
      (5)    In the event of the death of Employee, all remaining benefits
hereinunder shall be paid first directly to his/her surviving spouse or if
there is none, then to his/her estate as provided herein. The last effective
pay rate of the Employee shall be applied to all benefits herein.
      (6)    For the purpose hereof, a permanent disability of fifty percent
(50%) or more, recognized by the State of Ohio Industrial Commission, State
Police Pension Board, or competent physicians of both the City of Reminderville
and the Employee shall qualify Employee for payments of accumulated sick leave
when such Employee separates from service with the City of Reminderville by
reason of the disability.
      (7)    The Employee may elect, at the time of retirement from active
service with the City of Reminderville, to be paid in cash for twenty-five
percent (25%) of the sick leave hours accrued but unused by the Employee up to
a maximum of two thousand seven-hundred twenty (2,720) hours. The payments
shall be based on the Employee’s last effective pay rate. Such election shall
eliminate the Employee’s entire sick leave balance for purposes of Sick Leave
Conversion. Once such cash payment has been made, any remaining balance of sick
leave hours shall not be available for use as sick time should the Employee
ever be re-employed with the City of Reminderville; however, such balance shall
remain on file should it be requested by another employer in the future.
      (8)    Upon satisfaction of the above noted requirements for Sick Leave
Conversion, existing Employees of the Police Department may receive one hundred
percent (100%) of the sick leave hours accrued but unused by the Employee up to
an unlimited number of hours accumulated prior to the effective date of this
section. Any sick leave hours accrued after the effective date of this section
by any Employee of any Department of the City of Reminderville shall be subject
to the limitations prescribed herein.
      (9)    Any Sick Leave Conversion payments shall be paid over the course
of two (2) years, by no more than twenty-four (24) payments.

or resolutions inconsistent herewith be and the same are hereby repealed,

139.02) are hereby repealed. However, any ordinance and resolutions or portions
of ordinance and resolutions not inconsistent herewith and which have not
previously been repealed are hereby ratified and confirmed. (Ord. 9-2019.
Passed 6-11-19.)
   139.03  INJURY LEAVE WITH PAY.
   (a)    When a workplace injury or illness occurs, the employee and his/her
supervisor shall complete an Accident/Incident Report which shall be forwarded
to the Chief of Police within 24 hours of the incident. Failure to do so may
result in a delay of benefits.
   (b)    An injured worker shall not be paid any Injury Pay until the Workers
Compensation claim has been fully 'allowed' by the Bureau of Workers
Compensation and by the City. Prior to such approvals, the employee may use
Sick Leave for days absent due to the injury. After a claim is 'allowed',
Injury Leave will replace Sick Leave for that incident.
   (c)    When an employee is injured in the line of duty while actually
working for the City, the employee shall be eligible for a paid leave not to
exceed ninety working days providing the claim is' allowed' by the Ohio Bureau
of Workers' Compensation and the employee signs a waiver assigning to the City
the temporary total benefits which the employee would ordinarily receive as
their workers compensation' as determined by law, for those number of days the
employee receives benefits under this section.
   (d)    The City shall have the right to require the employee to have a
physical exam by a physician appointed and paid by the City, resulting in the
physician's certification that the employee is unable to work due to the injury
or illness as a condition precedent to the employee receiving any benefits
under this section. The designated physician's opinion shall govern whether the
employee is actually disabled or not, but shall not govern whether the City
shall extend the period of leave.
   (e)    When an employee is injured while on duty, the employee may be
eligible to return to work on light duty, if available, with the prior approval
of a physician attesting to the fact that the employee is capable of
satisfactorily performing the specific functions with or without
accommodations. The employee on light duty shall be compensated at his or her
regular rate of pay while performing light duty work. The light duty may be in
a department other than the employee's regular department and may involve work
that is not within the employee's regular job description.
   (f)    The City shall have the right to ask any employee injured in the line

full time employees upon receipt of confirmation of balance from the previous
employer. Such sick leave carried over from another employer shall not be

or more years of service to the City, death, or disability, as provided herein.

            (6)    For the purpose hereof, a permanent disability of fifty

of both the City of Reminderville and the Employee shall qualify Employee for
payments of accumulated sick leave when such Employee separates from service
with the City of Reminderville by reason of the disability.

payments shall be based on the Employee's last effective pay rate. Such
election shall eliminate the Employee's entire sick leave balance for purposes
of Sick Leave Conversion. Once such cash payment has been made, any remaining
balance of sick leave hours shall not be available for use as sick time should
the Employee ever be re-employed with the City of Reminderville; however, such
balance shall remain on file should it be requested by another employer in the
future.

current rules and directives.
   (b)    An injured worker shall not be paid any Injury Pay until the Workers

Injury Leave will replace Sick Leave for that incident.
   (c)    When an employee is injured in the line of duty while on duty and
working for the City, the employee shall be eligible to remain on paid status
for an unlimited number of working days providing the claim is “allowed” by the

physical exam by a physician appointed and paid by the City, resulting in the
physician's certification that the employee is unable to work due to the injury
or illness as a condition precedent to the employee receiving any benefits
under this section. The designated physician's opinion shall govern whether the
employee is or is not disabled, but shall not govern whether the City shall
extend the period of leave.
   (e)    When an employee is injured while on duty, the employee may be
eligible to return to work on light duty, if available, with the prior approval
of the Fire Chief and a physician attesting to the fact that the employee is
capable of satisfactorily performing the specific functions with or without
accommodations. The employee on light duty shall be compensated at his or her
regular rate of pay while performing light duty work.
   (f)    The City shall have the right to ask any employee injured in the line
of duty to perform light duty work if the physician approves the employee can
return to such light duty. If the employee refuses to perform light duty work,
the City has the right to deny sick leave or injury leave to the employee.
   (g)    The employee is not permitted to work for any other employer during
the hours that they are being paid Injury Leave by the City. Working for
another employer during hours that the employee is being paid Injury Leave by
the City, shall result in forfeiture of all Injury Leave pay for that injury or
illness.

overtime during a workweek. (Ord. 12-2023. Passed 5-9-23.)

U.S. Marine Corps or U.S. Coast Guard shall be granted leave, not to exceed
fifteen (15) shift days per calendar year, in addition to vacation leave, for
the purpose of participating in scheduled training duty. If the compensation
received for such training duty is less than the employee's normal pay from the
City, the employee will be paid the difference. If the compensation from the
training duty is greater than the employee's normal pay, then the leave shall
be leave without pay.
   (b)    Employees of the City shall be granted leave to serve in the military
forces of the United States when such service is in consequence of any Act of
Congress or call of the President of the United States. If the employee's

service.
   (c)    Provided application is made for re-employment within ninety (90)
days after expiration of the employee's obligated service, he/she shall be
reappointed at the same rank of status as he/she held at the time of his/her
call to military service. Any appointments or promotions affected while an
employee is on extended military leave will be made with an understanding of
the obligation of the City to reappoint such employee to his/her former rank at

leave shall be credited to an employee when he/she is reappointed for purposes
of longevity or qualification, just as though he/she were employed by the City

completed five (5) years or more of continuous service will be granted unpaid
personal leave. Employees must request personal leave in writing to the Fire
Chief at least two (2) weeks prior to the time you wish such leave to commence.
If the personal leave request is necessitated by an emergency, the employee or
a member of the employee’s immediate family must notify the Fire Chief as soon
as practicable; this should be followed up with a written explanation of the
nature of the leave and the expected length of absence. In such emergency
situations, the written explanation must normally be submitted within three (3)
days of the beginning of your leave.

personal leave in their former positions or positions comparable in status and
pay, subject to budgetary restrictions, the City’s need to fill vacancies, and
the ability of the City to find qualified temporary replacements.
   (e)    If an employee does not return to work by the expiration date of
leave or does not obtain permission in advance through the Fire Chief to extend
the leave, the City will consider him/her to have resigned.

personnel and in lieu of overtime compensation, the employee may elect to

(240) hours of compensatory time into the next calendar year.
               (4)    REPEAL

shall be based on the Employee’s last effective pay rate. Such election shall
eliminate the Employee’s entire sick leave balance for purposes of Sick Leave
Conversion. Once such cash payment has been made, any remaining balance of sick
leave hours shall not be available for use as sick time should the Employee
ever be re-employed with the City of Reminderville; however, such balance shall
remain on file should it be requested by another employer in the future.

Conversion, existing Employees of the Police Department may receive one hundred

benefits to all employees who are members of the Public Employees Retirement
System (PERS) or employed as policemen or firemen and are members of the Police
and Fireman’s Disability Pension Fund (PFDPF) or PERS are hereby modified as
follows, in order to provide for a salary reduction pick-up of employee
contributions to PERS and PFDPF.
   (b)    The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each such
employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable City
ordinances. Such total annual salary and salary per pay period of each employee
shall be payable by the City in two parts as follows: deferred salary; and cash
salary. An employee’s deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of said
employee’s total annual salary or salary per pay period which is required from
time to time by PERS or PFDPF to be paid as an employee and shall be paid by
the City to the PERS or PFDPF on behalf of said employee as a pick-up and in
lieu of the PERS or PFDPF employee contribution otherwise payable by said
employee. An employee’s cash salary shall be equal to said employee’s total
annual salary or salary per pay period less the amount of the pick-up for said
employee and shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to
said employee. The City shall compute and remit its employer contributions to
PERS or PFDPF based upon an employee’s total annual salary or salary per pay
period, including the aforesaid pick-up. The City’s total combined expenditures
for such employees’ total salaries otherwise payable under the applicable City
ordinances (including pick-up amounts) and its employer contributions to PERS
or PFDPF shall not be greater than the amounts it would have paid for those
items had this provision not been in effect.

for the purpose of computing daily rate of pay, for determining paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence, or for any similar purpose.
   (d)    Any pick-up by the City of an employee’s contributions to PERS or
PFDPF shall be mandatory for all of the employees previously described who are
members of the PERS or PFDPF. No such member shall have the option of choosing
to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the
City to PERS or PFDPF.
   (e)    The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
Federal, State and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of
such reporting and withholding, it being the City’s understanding that Federal
and Ohio income tax laws and regulations presently require it to report as an
employee’s gross income his total annual salary less the amount of the pick-up
while applicable municipal income tax laws require it to report as an
employee’s gross income his total annual salary including the amount of the
pick-up.
   (f)    The Mayor, or his designee, is hereby directed to take all acts
necessary and appropriate to initiate implementation of the provisions of this
section, including but not limited to making applications to the Internal
Revenue Service and the board administering the PERS or PFDPF programs to
determine the requirements of the boards in connection with such pick-up plan.

   191.04 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION.
   (a)   Method of Determination. In the taxation of income which is subject to
the City income tax, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the City shall
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the City, then only such portion shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the City for the purposes of municipal income taxation. The
portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been
derived from within the City in absence of actual records thereof, shall be
determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
City, during the taxable period to the average net book value of all real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever
         situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from+sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does produce an equitable
result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be submitted so as to
produce such result.
   (b)   Sales Made in the City. As used in subsection (a) hereof "sales made
in the City" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the City.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside of the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside of the City regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   Total Allocation. Add together the percentage determined in accordance
with subsection (a) hereof or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in subsection (a) hereof.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the City.
   (d)   Rentals. Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
191.03(a)(3), (4) and (5) only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived
(whether so rented, managed, or operated by a taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer, in whole or in part.
   Where a gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month; provided further, that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net profits derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds such two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month; provided further, that the person who operates a
licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross
income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
   (e)   Operating Loss-Carry Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to August 1, 1972, allocable to the City may be applied against the
portion of the profit of succeeding tax taxable years allocable to the City
until exhausted but in no event for more than five years immediately following
the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall
be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the City in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the City.
      (3)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations the manner
in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined. (1978 Code
Sec. 281.04)

a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed within four months from the end of such fiscal year or period.
The Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return
of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by such
employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commission or other
compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Administrator shall
be accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject
to tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions or other
compensation. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Subsection (a) hereof was amended by Ordinance 3-
1991 which extended the filing deadline for those serving in the Middle East.)
   (b)   Form and Content. The return shall be filed with the Administrator on
a form or forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator
setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned and gross income from business, profession, or other

finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,

shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits, to the City.

liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make

half percent(1 ½%) per annum is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every
person residing in and/or earning and/or receiving income in the City of
Reminderville.
Individuals.
   (A)   For residents of Reminderville, the income tax levied herein shall be
on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
192.02(C)(16)).
   (B)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
192.02(C)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City of
Reminderville with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            (ii)   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to Reminderville
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)   "Refundable credit" means the amount of Reminderville income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to
Reminderville for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent that taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in Reminderville

         (b)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile describe in
division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in
Reminderville for all or part of the taxable year.

individual;

the individual's residency;
         (g)   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
         (h)   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)   The number of contact periods the individual has with
Reminderville. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one
"contact period" with Reminderville if the individual is away overnight from
the individual's abode outside of Reminderville and while away overnight from
that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two (2)
consecutive days in Reminderville.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

   (F)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
Reminderville or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Reminderville shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in Reminderville for purposes of municipal income taxation in the
same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Reminderville during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Reminderville to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
192.04(C).
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
Reminderville to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Reminderville, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator
of the City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)   Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.12(A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
192.12(A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)   The employer;
            (ii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client or patient;
            (iii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client or patient
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in Reminderville if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within Reminderville
from a stock of goods located within Reminderville.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within Reminderville from a
location outside Reminderville, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
Reminderville and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within Reminderville
to purchasers outside Reminderville, provided that the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Reminderville to the extent that such services are performed in Reminderville.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Reminderville shall be sitused to Reminderville.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Reminderville shall be sitused to
Reminderville.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Reminderville based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Reminderville.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Reminderville's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Reminderville or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of
Reminderville. Reminderville shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Reminderville, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
Reminderville to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of Reminderville shall report
the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Reminderville. The individual may claim a credit for
taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation
to the extent that such a credit is allowed under Reminderville's income tax
ordinance. When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (7)   Intentionally left blank.

         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
192.04 of this chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 192.04 of this chapter.
         (Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Reminderville shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in Reminderville. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
192.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
192.03 of this Chapter. An Employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Reminderville the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Reminderville in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399.00, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of Reminderville in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.00.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payment to the Tax Administrator
not later that the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Reminderville. The payment of tax
by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and Reminderville as the
return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax
under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Reminderville income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.    
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Reminderville the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Reminderville income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Reminderville until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Reminderville during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Reminderville
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
Occasional Entrant-Withholding.

or controlled by an employer.
         (c)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of business" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
      If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee
spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for
or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i)of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)
(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

         (g)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than
twenty (20) days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include

      (2)   (a)   Subject to division (C)(3), (5), (6) and (7) of this section,
an employer is not required to withhold Reminderville income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in
Reminderville if the employee performed such services in Reminderville on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in
Reminderville.
            (ii)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Reminderville. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in Reminderville at which the employer provides or provided services
that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by
the employer to last more than 20 days if either of the following applies at
the time the services commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of Reminderville and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
192.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in
Reminderville only if the employee spent more time performing services for or
on behalf of the employer in Reminderville than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work.
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employer.
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Reminderville exceeds the 20 day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Reminderville for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Reminderville.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Reminderville
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
Reminderville for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in Reminderville.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Reminderville and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
192.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Reminderville, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of Reminderville.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
192.04.
         (Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Reminderville income tax return shall be completed and
filed by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject
to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
192.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due Reminderville.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Reminderville
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to Reminderville, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of the
Chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by Reminderville, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)   Reminderville shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio Form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Reminderville to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)    (1)    (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the Ohio
Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to Reminderville. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in the Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Reminderville. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Reminderville's income tax
return. The extended due date of Reminderville's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of Reminderville's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Reminderville's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Reminderville income tax
return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the Reminderville income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall
grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of Reminderville's income tax return. The extended due date of
Reminderville's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Reminderville, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge
that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive
the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or failed to file for an
extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.      
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Reminderville shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Reminderville for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with
Reminderville an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Reminderville income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with
Reminderville for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g))
within Reminderville.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in Reminderville and
does not expect to be subject to Reminderville income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Reminderville. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Reminderville, make any sales in Reminderville, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by Reminderville during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Reminderville for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with Reminderville income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations.” The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this Chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the time-stamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City of Reminderville by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
192.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Reminderville, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Reminderville and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by Reminderville to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Reminderville, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by
Reminderville or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this Chapter and of Reminderville's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing Via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file
Reminderville's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

withholding tax returns.

   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of
Reminderville for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by Reminderville during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to Reminderville before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Reminderville in accordance with
this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the National Guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid taxes.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Cade, except that, if such a

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.

Section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
Reminderville's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal low. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Reminderville income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Reminderville. A taxpayer that is required to file
a consolidated Reminderville income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Reminderville income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission form the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Reminderville income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3) and (4) of
this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that section.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Reminderville income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (2)(C)(1) to
the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the
adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Reminderville income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section 192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused

entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

Section
192.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Reminderville. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eight percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, the property,
payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of
the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Reminderville;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Reminderville income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
192.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Reminderville income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Reminderville in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Reminderville before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Reminderville may continue to file

dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
(12) months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month

      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month of
the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with Section 718.05 of the Ohio Revised
Cade.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22 ½%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

        (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is

any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with Reminderville under Section
192.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Reminderville but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

   192.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. (Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section

   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Reminderville:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18(A)(4).
(Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with Reminderville, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Reminderville as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Reminderville is subject to recovery by Reminderville.
If Reminderville's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed

Reminderville shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding
Reminderville claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the
tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income
or wages.
   (C)   If Reminderville's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Reminderville's tax rate, However, if Reminderville's tax rate is greater than
the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to Reminderville, along with any penalty and
interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry-forward.
(Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Reminderville changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Reminderville. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of Section
192.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by Reminderville. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Reminderville tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Reminderville return showing income

federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional
Reminderville income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than then dollars.

      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board or Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination of the
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
192.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Reminderville does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal, an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
192.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Reminderville income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that

         (Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the ground that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after
the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Reminderville official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facia evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facia evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Reminderville
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by the Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 23-2023. Passed 11-28-23.)
   192.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Reminderville that arises pursuant to Reminderville's income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of
Reminderville:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to

(ORC 4513.60)
   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.

property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.

willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
 331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy- two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three- day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first- time offender
under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that
the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited
driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first- time offender
under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that
the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited
driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

feet nine inches in height, who is not required by subsection (a) or (b) of
this section to be secured in a child restraint system, is being transported in
a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety vehicle as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under Ohio R.C. 5104.011, that
is required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped
with seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the
motor vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
   (d)   When any child who is at least eight years of age but not older that

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

qualified technician or chemist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer, and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law
enforcement officer.
      (7)   A physician, registered nurse, or qualified technician or chemist
who withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital,
first-aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant

the court, in lieu of the suspended term of imprisonment, places the offender
on probation and requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory three
consecutive days of imprisonment that it is required to impose by subsection
(f)(1) hereof if the court places the offender on probation for part of the
three consecutive days; requires the offender to attend, for that part of the
three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention program that is certified
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10; and sentences the offender to a term of

sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of ten consecutive days and may
sentence the offender pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to a longer term of
imprisonment. In addition, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of
not less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) nor more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000).
   In addition to any other sentence that it imposes upon the offender, the
court may require the offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program that
is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
      (3)   If, within five years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to more than one violation of this section, Ohio
R.C. 1547.11, of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a watercraft or
manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, of a

case in which the jury or judge found that the offender was under the influence
of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, the court shall
sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of thirty consecutive days and
may sentence the offender to a longer term of imprisonment of not more than one

court may require the offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program that
is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
      (4)   Upon a showing that imprisonment would seriously affect the ability
of an offender sentenced pursuant to subsections (f)(1), (2) and (3) hereof to
continue the offender’s employment, the court may authorize that the offender
be granted work release from imprisonment after the offender has served the
three, ten, or thirty consecutive days of imprisonment that the court is
required by subsections (f)(1), (2) and (3) hereof to impose. No court shall
authorize work release from imprisonment during the three, ten, or thirty
consecutive days of imprisonment that the court is required by subsections (f)
(1), (2) and (3) hereof to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from the
place of employment and the place of imprisonment and the time actually spent
under employment.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any section of the Revised Code that authorizes the
suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or the placement of an
offender in any treatment program in lieu of imprisonment, no court shall
suspend the ten or thirty consecutive days of imprisonment required to be
imposed by subsections (f)(2) or (3) or place an offender who is sentenced

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. (ORC
2901.21)
 
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender's specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person's
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this

   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or

and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.

(ORC 2901.24)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor     Maximum  Fine
First degree            $5000.00
Second degree           4000.00
Third degree            3000.00

Minor misdemeanor not
specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Mayor or
Police Chief shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and

on the health, safety, and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on
property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the special
variance. Applicants for special variances and persons contesting special
variances may be required to submit any information the Mayor or Police Chief
may reasonably require. In grating or denying an application, the Mayor or
Police Chief shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons
for denying or granting the special variance.

containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any conditions of the
special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those
provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which
the special variance was granted.
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for initial special variances.

variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a
special variance.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.

   531.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When not inconsistent
with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in
the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include
the plural. "Shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
   (a)   "Minor" means any person under the age of eighteen or, in equivalent
phrasing often herein employed, any person seventeen or less years of age.
   (b)   "Parent" means any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)   As a natural or adoptive parent;
      (2)   As a legal guardian;
      (3)   As a person who stands in loco parentis; or
      (4)   As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court.
   (c)   "Remain" means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon
the streets, including the congregating of groups, or of interacting minors,
totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using
the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going
home.
   (d)   "Street" means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of
the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case
of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. "Street" includes the legal right
of way, including but not limited to the traffic lanes, the curb, the
sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found
within the legal right of way of a street. "Street" applies irrespective of
what it be called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court,, road or
otherwise.
   (e)   "Time of night" is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether
Eastern Standard time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at
that hour by the public in the Municipality, prima facie the time then observed
in the Municipal Administrative Offices and Police Station.
   (f)   "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to,
but not including the day of, the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making
it clear that seventeen or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to
the phrase "under eighteen years of age". Similarly, for example, eleven or
less years of age means under twelve years of age.
   531.02 CURFEW HOURS.
   No person seventeen or less years of age shall be or remain in or upon the
streets within the Municipality at night during the period of time commencing
at 10:30 p.m. and ending at 5:30 a.m.
   531.03 EXCEPTIONS.
   In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a street during the nocturnal
hours for which Section
531.02 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not be
considered in violation of this chapter:
   (a)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   (b)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   (c)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
first delivering, to communications center personnel at the Municipal Building,
where and by whom high priority messages to the Chief of Police are regularly
received, written communication signed by such minor and countersigned if
practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone
number, addressed to the Chief of Police specifying when, where and in what
matter the minor will be on the streets at night, during the hours when this
chapter is otherwise applicable to the minor, in the exercise of a First
Amendment right specified in such communication.
   (d)   In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent
has communicated to the Police Station personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a
described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of such
communication or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of
Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received
and of the names and address of such parent and minor, shall be admissible
evidence.
   (e)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.
   (f)   When returning home, by a direct route from, and within thirty minutes
of the termination of a school activity, or an activity of a religious or other
voluntary asociation, of which prior notice, indicating the place and probable
time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for immediate
reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the
Police Station.
   (g)   When the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each
calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more
than forty-five days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and place of employment and
his hours of employment.
   (h)   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona
fide interstate movement through the Municipality. This also exempts interstate
travel beginning or ending in the Municipality.
   (i)   Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, such
as provisions for notification, are severable, and additional, also severable
exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled
respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be considered by
Council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student
government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward,
precinct and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority
concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
   531.04 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or by
inefficient control, allow such minor to be or remain upon any street under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this chapter. "Knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
   531.05 POLICE PROCEDURES.
   A policeman, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the
streets in prima facie violation of this chapter, normally shall take the minor
to the Police Station, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for
such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access
to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a
birth certificate, a policeman on the street shall in the first instance, use
his best judgment in determining age.
   (a)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a
parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example, a minor of
tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or
are known.
   (b)   In any event, such policeman shall within twenty-four hours file a
written report or shall participate to the extent of the information for which
he is responsible in the preparation by himself and with the Juvenile
Investigator, in the filing of such report within twenty-four hours.
   (c)   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   (d)   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall
by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of the violation with a
warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this
chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable
penalties.
   531.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    If, after the warning notice pursuant to Section
531.05 of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates Section
531.04 in connection with a second violation by such minor, this shall be
treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a
parent shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and for each subsequent offense,
a parent shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (b)   Normal procedures before the juvenile authorities shall be followed in
any case where the provisions of this chapter cannot be made effective by the
imposition of other penalties under this section.

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in

a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

when the Applicant provides a supplemental submission in response to the City's
notice of incompleteness issued pursuant to subsection (b), but may be tolled
again if the City notifies the applicant in writing, within ten (10) days of
receiving a supplemental submission, that the Application remains incomplete
and identifies which items specified in the original notice of incompleteness
are still missing. Timely notice by the City of the deficiencies in a
supplemental submission tolls the time period set forth in subsection (a) until
the Applicant supplies the specified information.
   (c)   The timeframes in subsection (a) may be tolled by mutual agreement
between the Applicant and the City. The timeframes in subsections (a)(2) and

      (Ord. 03-2004. Passed 7-13-04.)
   1102.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Developers of subdivision developments, any new commercial,
industrial, institutional or utility development must submit a Stormwater
Management Plan to the Summit County Soil and Conservation District and the
City Engineer. No final plans shall be approved, no building permits shall be
issued, and no construction related activity will take place on the property
until and unless the Stormwater Management Plan has been submitted to the
Summit County Soil and Water Conservation District, the City Engineer and
approved by Council.
   (b)   Developers of individual lots shall submit a Storm Water Management
Plan to the City Storm Water Committee and the City Engineer. No final plans
shall be approved, no building permits shall be issued and no construction
related activity may take place on the property until and unless the Storm
Water Management Plan has been reviewed by the City Engineer, the City Storm
Water Committee and approved by Council.
(Ord. 03-2004. Passed 7-13-04.)
   1102.04 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS.
   The required Storm Water Management Plan shall identify means for
controlling the stormwater runoff release rate from the site or development and
providing storage potential for the excess storm water runoff (where required).
All computations and plans to the implementation of this chapter must be
prepared in accordance with, but not be limited to, the most recent version of
the Stormwater Management Manual published by the Summit County Engineer and/or
items requested by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 03-2004. Passed 7-13-04.)
   1102.05  DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The following rules shall govern the design of improvements with respect to
managing stormwater runoff:
   (a)   Methods of Determining Storm Water Runoff Rate and Volume. Calculating
runoff discharge rate and total volume drainage and detention facilities shall
be made using the most recent version of the Stormwater Management Manual
published by the Summit County Engineer and/or as requested by the City
Engineer.
   (b)   Drainage Facility Design.
      (1)   Developers of subdivision developments, any new commercial,
industrial, institutional or utility development that propose to drain storm
water into the City's storm water system shall construct drainage facilities
designed to hold the 100-year rain event using post construction parcel
hydrology. Storm water can be released from the ponds at a maximum of the 5-
year pre-construction hydrology rate.
         A.   All drainage facility shorelines and basin bottoms shall be
planted with native Ohio vegetation in an effort to capture and assimilate
water pollution. This ordinance does not regulate additional water quality
ponds as mandated by the EPA or any other County or State agency.
      (2)   The developer of an individual lot that proposes to drain storm
water into the City's storm water system shall deposit sufficient funds into
the City of Reminderville Storm Water Pond Fund for the City to manage the
stormwater. Such funds shall be used by the City to 1) purchase strategic land,
2) create stormwater ponds, 3) drainage way maintenance, or 4) be placed in the
stormwater general fund.
         A.   The amount of such deposit shall be calculated using the selling
price of current land, the space needed to capture the additional volume of
water flowing from the property during the 100-year rain event due to
construction/improvements, and the associated construction cost of the basin to
accommodate the additional volume. The City Engineer shall perform this
calculation and the owner and/or builder shall be responsible for any costs
associated with making the cost determination.
         B.   It shall be the responsibility of the City to inspect and
maintain these retention and detention ponds.
            (Ord. 03-2004. Passed 7-13-04.)

preliminary plat and prior to the approval of the final plat and/or
construction drawings, the developer shall submit to the City Engineer and the
County Soils Department a general grading plan for the entire subdivision or
development. The Engineer shall review the plan to insure the control of soil
sediment pollution caused by accelerated erosion during development and by
accelerated storm water runoff after development. If, in the judgment of the
City Engineer, the topography is that the drainage of the sublots or parcels
shall require the installation of storm drains or storm sewers from rear yards,
open space, and phased development, such storm drains or storm sewers shall be
installed by the developer at the time that the sewer and water improvements
are installed in the subdivision or development.
If any lot or parcel collects and discharges surface water other than directly
to an on-site stream, river or into a storm sewer system, the Engineer shall

maintained by the owner thereof. The City shall have the right to enter onto
such sublot or lands to maintain any drainage system approved by the Engineer
in the event the owner thereof shall fail to correct a problem after
notification by the Engineer. Any costs incurred shall be chargeable to the
property owner, or made a lien on such premises, in accordance with Ohio R.C.
715.47.
In any of the foregoing circumstances, the construction of open drainage
ditches as a substitute for such storm drains or storm sewers shall not be
permitted.

(1978 Code Secs. 1270.05, 1270.07)
   1137.04 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the following powers:
(a)   To hear and decide appeals, filed as hereinbefore provided, where it is
alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, grant or refusal made by the Building Inspector or other
administrative official in the interpretation of the provisions of this
section.
(b)   To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases, filed as hereinbefore
provided, such variance from the provisions or requirements of this section as
will not be contrary to the public interest; but only in such cases where,
owing to special conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, the
literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this section would
cause undue and unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the section
shall be observed and substantial justice done.
(c)   Where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or unusual
shape of a specific piece of property on the effective date of this section, or
by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary
situation or conditions of such piece of property, or of the use or development
of property immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, the
literal enforcement of the requirements of this section would involved
practical difficulty or would cause unnecessary hardship, unnecessary to carry
out the spirit and purpose of this section, the Board shall have the power to
authorize a variance from terms of this section so as to relieve such hardship,
and so that the spirit and purpose of this section shall be observed and
substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of
the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the interest of the
furtherance of the purposes of variance, with attached conditions; the Board
shall require such evidence and guarantee or bond, as it may deem to be
necessary, that the condtions attached are being and will be complied with.
(d)   No such variance in the provisions or requirements of this section shall
be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds, beyond reasonable doubt,
that all the following facts and conditions exist:
(1)   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property in question, or to the intended use of the property,
that do not apply generally to other properties or classes of uses in the same
district.
(2)   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district
and in the same vicinity.
(3)   That the authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property, and will not materially impair the purposes of
this chapter or the public interest.
(e)   No grant of variance shall be authorized unless the Board specifically
finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of property, or the
intended use of such property for which variance is sought, one or the other or
in comobination, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of general regulation for such
conditions or situation.
(f)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide, in accordance with the
provisions of this section, applications, filed as hereinbefore provided, for
special exceptions in the use of land, buildings and other structures; for
interpretation of the Zoning Map; for decisions upon other special questions on
which the Board is authorized by this section to pass. In considering a special
exception or interpretation of the Zoning Map, the Board shall give due regard
to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures; and in
authorizing a specific exception, the Board may impose such maintenance and
operation, in addition to those expressly stipulated in this section for the
particular exceptions, as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and the public interest.
(g)   The Board shall have the power to permit the restoration, extension,
alteration, or change of a nonconforming use.

taken within twenty days after the decision. An appeal shall stay all
proceedings in furtherance of the action apealed from , unless the Bulding

Building Apeals after the notice of the appeal has been filed, that by reason
of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent
peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed by
other than a restraining order granted by the Boasrd or by a court having
lawful jurisdiction. Within its powers The Board may reverse or affirm wholly
or in pat or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as in its
opinion ought to be done, and to that end, shall have all the powers of the
Building Inspector from whom the appeal is taken, and it may issue or direct

Appeals shall decide all appeals within thirty days after date of hearing.

board, or bureau. Such application shall be filed with the Building Inspector

      (Ord. 20-2004. Passed 10-26-04.)
   1151.02 PURPOSES.
   (a)    It is desirable that a zoning district be established which will
permit the application of modern planning techniques in the development of
residential areas, providing a variety of housing-types with suitable
recreational uses being developed within such residential areas.
   (b)    The clustering of houses and multi-family dwelling units, as defined
in this Zoning Code, in order that large areas of land can be left open, for
more flexible recreational use by all inhabitants within an area and for the
preservation of large areas of natural scenic beauty is appropriate. This
arrangement does not adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the
community and the citizens thereof when such open spaces can be assured for the
use of all of the residents within an area or within the planned development
district.
(Ord. 20-2004. Passed 10-26-04.)
   1151.03 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In determining whether or not to establish a planned development district
within an area of the  City  and in reviewing any plans for the development of
such a district, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council shall take into
consideration the effect the district and its development will have upon
properties in the surrounding vicinity, population density, open spaces,
traffic problems and the relation to public safety, the availability and
provision for essential services particularly water and sewage disposal, the
need for adequate open space to provide light and air and recreational
facilities, population trends, topography, unique scenic features of the
particular parcel under consideration and the health, safety and welfare of the
community and the citizens thereof in the  City  and surrounding metropolitan
areas.
(Ord. 20-2004. Passed 10-26-04.)
   1151.04 AREA, DENSITY AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Area Requirements.  A planned development district shall contain at
least 100 acres of land. All land within the district shall be contiguous and
shall not be divided into parts by any State or Federal limited access highway,
or by any large area of land not included within the district, or by any
railroad rights of way. The existence of public or private streets or highways
other than limited access highways, electrical transmission lines, transmission
pipes or other rights of way in fee or by easement within any area shall not be
considered as any large area of land in determining if an area is contiguous.
   (b)    Density Requirements.  In a planned development district, the overall
density of the dwelling units within the district shall not exceed three
dwelling units per acre after first subtracting fifteen percent (15%) acreage
to be devoted for open space. Ledges, wetlands and other geographical phenomena
may be included within the fifteen percent (15%) open space, however, if such
geological phenomena exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the area of the district,
then such additional area shall also be excluded when determining density for
the district: The residential use areas shall consist of at least thirty-three
and one-third percent (33-1/3%) single-family dwelling units.
      (1)    In computing the overall density, residential and recreational use
areas of the district shall be used for the calculation, excluding all areas
intended for open space, school sites, street areas, parking lots, wetlands or
land set aside for nature preserves and other similar non-open space areas.
      (2)    As used in the above paragraph, land area means the acreage of the
building site.
   (c)    Open Space Requirements.  In a planned development district, at least
fifteen percent (15%) of the land constituting the district shall be reserved
as open space on which no buildings or structures other than buildings or
structures for recreational uses shall be may be constructed. Parking lots are
not to be considered as open space. Such open space including any recreational
facilities proposed to be constructed in such space shall be clearly shown on
the general plan, and the general plan shall include descriptive data as to
methods to be employed to preserve and maintain such space.

   1157.02  PURPOSES.
   (a)    It is desirable that a zoning district be established which will
permit the application of modern planning techniques in the development of
residential areas, providing a variety of housing types while preserving the
environmental assets contained within.
   (b)    It is desirable to permit the clustering of houses and multi-family

for the residents of the ECPDD to enjoy.
(Ord. 4-2005. Passed 3-22-05.)
   1157.03  GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In determining whether or not to establish a ECPDD within the area of the
City  and in reviewing any plans for the development of such a district, the
Planning and Zoning Commission (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Planning
Commission") and Council shall take into consideration the effect that the
district and its development will have upon properties in the surrounding

   1339.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Reminderville as identified in subsection (d) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Reminderville.
   (d)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 20, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year

a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Reminderville as required by Section
1339.04(c).

hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the City Hall at 3382 Glenwood
Boulevard, Reminderville, Ohio 44202.
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.

         C.    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes.
      (2)   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a
state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Reminderville, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (h)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 10-2009. Passed 6-9-09.)
   1339.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (3)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (4)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (5)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (6)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (7)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor”. See “Lowest Floor.”
   (8)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)”means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (13)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      A.   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the
100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      C.   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      D.   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
      E.   ZoneA99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system
under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (15)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
   (16)   “Flood Protection Elevation” or FPE, is the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   “Floodway”.
      A.   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      B.   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (18)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above
a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Reminderville's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” means an official FEMA determination,
by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down
into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   “Manufactured home park”, as specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (25)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   “New construction” means structures for which the" start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of
Reminderville Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 17, 1990, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (27)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (28)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (29)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (30)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (31)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (32)   “Special Flood Hazard Area,” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AI-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction;"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (37)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 10-2009. Passed 6-9-09.)

of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required . The following as-built

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Reminderville's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1339.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.    Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1339.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Reminderville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Reminderville have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Reminderville's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Reminderville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of Reminderville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Reminderville has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1339.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1339.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Reminderville and the

actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1 and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Reminderville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1339.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance application shall be accompanied by
a application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of
Reminderville.
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 10-2009. Passed 6-9-09.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1339.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that

1344.01 CREATION OF CHAPTER.
   Council hereby creates Chapter
1172 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Reminderville which shall read
as follows:
   (a)   COMMUNITY: Throughout this regulation the Community shall mean the
City of Reminderville, State of Ohio, and its designated agents and
representatives.
   (b)   COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN: The Construction Site
Conservation Plan developed to meet this regulation will be coordinated and
combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and the Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan that are developed for the same site. These plans will be
titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water Permit for General
Construction.
      (Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.02  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of this regulation is to establish consistent technically
feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm
water management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
Community.
 
   (b)   This regulation further intends, but is not limited, to:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream
flooding, erosion, and sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems
that are caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (4)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (7)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
      (11)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
         (Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.03  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.04  CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
 
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
 
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
 
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom. (Ord. 13-2013.
Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.05  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.06 SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, subdivisions, industrial
projects, commercial projects, building activities on farms, redevelopment of
urban areas and all other land uses not specifically exempted. This chapter
does not apply to:
   (a)   Land disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops or
Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution
Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio Administrative
Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (b)   Coal surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1513 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (c)   Other surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1514 of the Ohio
Revised Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
      (Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.07  CONSULTATIONS.
   (a)   In implementing these regulations the Community Engineer or other
Community officials may consult with the local county SWCD, state and federal
agencies and other technical experts as necessary. Any costs associated with
such consultations may be assessed to the applicant or his or her designated
representative.
 
   (b)   The issuance of two building permits is an option that is recommended
in order to ensure compliance with having the required BMPs installed with the
minimal use of inspectors and enforcement time. This option applies to single-
family residential construction and other similar types of construction. By
using this two building permit approach the community can use positive
reinforcement by issuing the second building permit after the required BMPS
have been installed instead of using negative enforcement such as stop work
orders, fines and jail time. Two versions of a Temporary Seeding table are
found in the Minimum Standards section of this chapter. The one that is
selected will be determined by which option the community selects in this
section.
(Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.08  ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS.
   Two building permits will be issued for all single-family residential
construction and similar types of construction as determined by the Community
Engineer. The first building permit shall allow the construction of the footers
and basement walls or slab. No additional construction shall be performed and
no additional building materials shall be allowed on the site until the
Community has issued the second building permit. The Community Engineer may
approve the stockpiling of additional construction materials on the site prior
to the issuance of the second permit if a suitable location can be identified.
Proper Soil Erosion and Sediment Control must be maintained on the stockpile
area prior to, during, and after the area is used for stockpiling.
   The second building permit, allowing delivery of the remaining building
materials and the remaining construction activities, shall not be issued until
the Community Engineer certifies that the required BMPs and any other BMPs
identified in the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan submitted with the
Application for the first building permit have been properly installed,
pursuant to the most recent edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development
manual. (Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.09 CONSTRUCTION SITE CONSERVATION PLAN.
   (a)   In order to control storm water damage and sediment pollution of water
resources, wetlands, riparian areas, other natural areas, and public and
private lands, the owner of each development area shall be responsible for
developing a comprehensive Construction Site Conservation Plan. This plan will
address storm water management (volume and peak rate of runoff), soil erosion,
sediment and other wastes control. This plan must contain a description of
controls appropriate for each construction operation covered by these
regulations, and the operator must implement the planned controls in a timely
manner. The plan and BMPs used to satisfy the conditions of these regulations
shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rain Water and Land Development manual. The plan must make use of the practices
that preserve the existing natural condition to the Maximum Extent Practicable.
The plan shall identify the subcontractors engaged in activities that could
impact storm water runoff. The Construction Site Conservation Plan shall
contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that
they have been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in
complying with the Construction Site Conservation Plan.
 
   (b)   If the community intends to require soil erosion, sediment and storm
water management controls on construction sites that disturb less than 1 acre
(43,560 square feet) the next section should be included. This section needs to
be deleted if small construction sites are not to be regulated by this chapter.
 
   (c)   The lower limit of 8,000 square feet of disturbed land area is used in
this model because at least one community in northeast Ohio has used this
threshold for several years. The Community can select an alternative threshold
value of its choosing not to exceed 1 acre in size.
 
   (d)   Development Sites Under 1 (One) Acre In Size: Individual development
sites that are larger than 8,000 square feet and smaller than one (1) acre
(43,560 square feet) in total size of disturbed area, can submit abbreviated
soil erosion and sediment control plans with the topography plan for the
requested permit(s). The abbreviated plan must cover the following items, in
addition to any other items from this chapter that are required by the
Community Engineer.
      (1)   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the increased storm water
runoff that will be caused by the planned development project will be handled.
This statement must identify the Best Management Practices (BMPs) the new
construction project will include in order to address storm water runoff.
      (2)   Redevelopment Exemption: Owners of development sites that were
created by demolishing an older existing structure can request, in writing,
that the Community Engineer exempt them from the storm water issues if the
total soil surface area being made impermeable is the same or less than the
total soil surface area that was impermeable due to the structure(s) being torn
down and removed.
      (3)   Riparian and Wetland Setbacks: All riparian and wetland setback
areas will be identified in the plan and in the field before construction
starts.
      (4)   Soil Erosion and Sediment Issues: A sketch of the entire
development site must be submitted that identifies the location of:
         A.   All existing and planned impervious areas, storm water inlets,
drainage swales, wetlands, streams, conservation easements and other natural
features to be saved and protected on the property.
         B.   All existing and planned temporary and permanent conservation
practices for the site. Residential lots shall include at a minimum the
following:

the site or accepting drainage from the site, and;
            5.   Silt Fence protection for any stream located on or close to
the site and lacking an adequate vegetative buffer, and;
            6.   Silt Fence to prevent sediment discharge into street storm
sewer inlets where no centralized sediment control exists for the drainage area
that includes the lot, and;
            7.   Construction fence to protect any conservation easements,
riparian setbacks and wetland setbacks from encroachment by construction
activities.
      (5)   The schedule for the use of Temporary Seeding developed according
to the Temporary Seeding Table contained in the Minimum Standards Section of
this chapter must be included. The location of construction material stockpile

(Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.10  EASEMENTS.
   Future access to floodplains, flood control facilities, runoff drainage
ditches and channels, runoff storage facilities, storm sewers and other
drainage ways and structures, as required by the Community Engineer, shall be
secured by means of easements.
   (a)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the Community and, in
single-family residential developments, the homeowners association.
   (b)   Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width,
in addition to the width of the ditch, channel, or other facility it is to
serve. Access easements of this type shall be provided on one (1) side of the
flood control or storm drainage ditch, channel, or similar type facility.
   (c)   Access along the initial drainage system shall be by means of
easements. Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in
width, with a minimum ten (10) foot width on either side of the centerline.
   (d)   Access adjacent to storage facilities shall consist of a twenty-five
(25) foot easement in the case of detention (dry) basins, and a twenty-five
(25) foot easement with a twenty-five 25 foot level bench in the case of

   (e)   Easements for the emergency flow ways shall be a minimum of twenty-
five (25) feet in width, or larger if required by the Community Engineer.
   (f)   Flood control or storm drainage easements containing underground
facilities shall have a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet.
   (g)   The easements shall be restricted against the planting within said
easement of trees, shrubbery or plantings with woody growth characteristics,
and against the construction therein of buildings, accessory buildings, fences,
walls or any other obstructions to the free flow of storm water and the
movement of inspectors and maintenance equipment and also restricted against
the changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan.
      (Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.11 MAINTENANCE.
   Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including
on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will
be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)   Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the
Community Engineer and the post- construction operator of the BMP (including
homeowner associations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to
the Community Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
   (b)   Single Family and Multi-family Residential Developments:  A
Homeowners' Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected
lands and shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance
and inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become
officially accepted by the Community.
   (c)   Apartments, Commercial and Industrial Developments: The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the
Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.
   (d)   Maintenance Design: All temporary and permanent soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures
and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and
maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans.
Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
   (e)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each and every year after the Best Management
Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water: A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk for
loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related
to imminent failure as determined by the Community Engineer: A written and
stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or Certified
Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction. (Ord. 13-2013.
Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.12  MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table below
(placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the
drainage area).
 
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to Range of slope for a particular drainage
area
 
 
100 linear feet of Silt Fence (in percent)
0.5                           < 2%
0.25                          2% but < 20%
0.125                         20% but < 50%
 
 
      This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale
Barriers are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices: Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
 
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven (7) days of the most
(1) year or more                        recent disturbance
Any areas within fifty (50) feet of a   Within two (2) days of reaching final
stream and at final grade               grade
Any other areas at final grade          Within seven (7) days of reaching final
                                        grade within that area
 
 
   If the community selects the option of requiring two building permits on
single-family residential construction and other similar types of construction
Option 1 below of the "Table 2: Temporary Stabilization" is the correct table
to select. The difference is in the "Time frame" column of the "Residential
subdivisions for disturbance which has occurred on building lots" row. This is
compatible with the NPDES Storm Water Permit Rules for Construction Activities.
 
 
Option 1
 
Table 3: Temporary Stabilization
 
Area requiring temporary stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed areas within fifty (50)   Within two (2) days of the most recent
feet of a stream and not at final grade disturbance if the area will remain
                                        idle for twenty-one (21) days or more
Disturbed areas that will be dormant
for more than 21 days but less than one Within seven (7) days of the most
(1) year and not within fifty (50) feet recent disturbance within the area
of a stream
                                        Within 7 days of the most recent
Residential subdivisions for            disturbance if housing unit
disturbance which has occurred on       construction on the lot is not
buildings lots                          scheduled to begin within 21 days of
                                        the disturbance
                                        In any case, Temporary or Permanent
                                        Stabilization will be properly
                                       installed, pursuant to the most recent
                                        edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land
                                        Development manual, before the second
                                        building permit is issued.
                                        Within 7 days of the most recent
Non-residential subdivisions and        disturbance if further construction

                                        Where vegetative stabilization
                                        techniques may cause structural
                                       instability or are otherwise

employed.
 
Option 2
 
   To be selected if the two building permits process for single family
residential construction and other similar types of construction is not
selected for use in a community's ordinance. The intent of this table is to
require that individual sublots be covered with a Temporary Seeding prior to
transferring the Ohio EPA NPDES Permit coverage from one developer to another
or to a homebuilder. Without using two building permits, the only way that a
community can ensure that this requirement is met is to:
   1.    First require a copy of the Ohio EPA letter stating the permit
coverage has been transferred. This letter takes Ohio EPA two weeks to process
and mail. Since the Permit transfer request is to be submitted 7 days before
the lot ownership transfer takes place, the selection of this method can
prevent a builder from starting construction for a minimum of fourteen (14)
days after the property transfer takes place.
   2.   The Community Engineer must inspect the lot to be sure the temporary
seeding has been done. This will add to the builders delay unless the Community
Engineer inspects the parcel prior to receipt of a copy of the NPDES Permit
Coverage transfer letter.

                                        Engineer shall then inspect the lot to
                                        ensure that the Temporary Seeding has
                                        been done.

   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability
or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
 
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds:
      (1)   A sediment settling pond is required for any one of the following
conditions:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of
silt fence or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of
inlet protection; or
         D.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
         E.   Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in
writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner
demonstrated to be equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
      (2)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres disturbed
at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided
until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 10
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used.
      (3)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and
1000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (4)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 48 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever is most
stringent.
      (5)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4:1 is
recommended.
      (6)   The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet.
      (7)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (8)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (9)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all upslope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
      (2)   All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more
acres will require a sediment settling pond.
      (3)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All sediments
shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water
is outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps Of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned
and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non- erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils: 
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports when
deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has 80% vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections:
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven (7)
calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the Community Engineer certifies the site as being stable.
The Community Engineer certification does not relieve the permittee from
meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more
than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a
definable area has been fully stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and
no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site.
      (4)   Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed
by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the
inspection report must include:
         A.   The inspection date;
         B.   Names, titles, and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection;
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection
including the timing, duration, and depth of any storms;
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of the inspection;
         E.   Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from
the site;
         F.   Location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained;
         G.   Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location;
         H.   Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist
at the time of the inspection; and,
         I.   Crrective action required including any necessary changes to the
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan and implementation dates.
      (5)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
         A.   Requiring the owner's inspections to be documented and turned in
to the Community Engineer will give the Community the information it needs to
see if there are problems on the site and to insure that those problems are
being taken care of by the owner with a minimum of Community time and expense.
      (6)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.
      (7)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (8)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (9)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (11)   Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (13)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within 10 days of the inspection.
      (14)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
      (15)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community's and state's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum
and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage area. All
additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed. If the
fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be kept in the "dike"
tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminants, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on- lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)   Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Community Engineer and anyone else requested by the Community
Engineer to the meeting.
   (w)   Storm Water Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the storm water management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, whichever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Community Engineer
to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock- lined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
         (Ord. 13-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1344.13  STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
 
   (b)   Runoff Volume: Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in subsection (a) hereof determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q
after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from this table:
 
 
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
 
The Percentage Increase in Volume of Runoff is:
Equal To or  And Less The 24-Hour “Critical Storm”
Greater Than Than     For Discharge Will Be:
0            10       1 Year
10           20       2 Years
20           50       5 Years
50           100      10 Years
100          250      25 Years
250          500      50 Years
500          --       100 Years
 
 
   (c)   Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion of Existing Facilities:
      (1)   For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of
a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the
post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one (1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Community

storm water, soil erosion, sediment, or other wastes control or water quality
practice prior to the approval of the final plat where, in the Community
Engineer's judgment, such proper construction or installation is not
immediately necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and
where the prior installation or construction of such improvement would
constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in the case of new vegetation
or weather conditions, or because in the case of concrete, building
construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and tear on new
structures. In such event, the Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee that such deferred improvements
will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed specified time, but
not to exceed six (6) months after the filing of such final plat.
   The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent
improvements, and soil erosion, wastes controls, and water quality practices.
   The Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check
or Cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil erosion,
sediment, and other wastes controls and water quality practices will be
constructed and removed in a timely manner, as determined by the Community
Engineer.
   (a)   The Guarantee: The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash. The
Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in the ORC Chapter 711.101.
      (1)   Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or Review Boards.

Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
      (3)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
Construction Site Conservation Plan having been approved by the Community
Engineer.

for a period of not less than 2 (two) years after final acceptance of the storm
water, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices in an amount
equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer, of the
construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension: The Community Engineer may extend for cause the time
allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
   (e)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection: The Community will not release the Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
   (g)   Slow Release Devices: Performance and maintenance guarantees will be
maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed in
detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform
ground cover at a growth density of 80% or better.
   (h)   Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released
by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.

   (a)    It is hereby determined that the system of streams within the City of
Reminderville contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the City. The purpose of this Riparian Setback chapter is to
protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the City of
Reminderville and to protect residents of the City from property loss and
damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream. The method of
implementing this chapter is by controlling uses and developments within a
Riparian Setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters and regulating base flow.
      (2)    Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)    Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams.
      (4)    Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter
streams.
      (5)    Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of
stream channels.
      (6)    Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain
diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (7)    Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)    Benefit the City of Reminderville economically by minimizing
encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and to the environment of the City, the quality of life of
the residents of the City and corresponding property values.
      (9)    Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
City of Reminderville.
   (b)    The following regulation has been enacted to protect these services
of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing structures and
uses in riparian setbacks.

the City of Reminderville without full compliance with the terms of these
regulations where applicable.
   (c)    Any person or organization who violates Section
1345.07 shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be required to restore the Riparian Setback through a plan approved by
the City Engineer.
   (d)    The provisions of this chapter may be enforced through civil or
criminal proceedings brought by the City Solicitor on behalf of the City of
Reminderville.
(Ord. 35-2004. Passed 12-14-04.)
   1345.03  CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS AND SEVERABILITY.
   (a)    Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract or
deed, the provisions of this chapter shall control.

tops, heart rot, or insect or fungus problems that will lead to imminent death,
undercut root systems that put the tree in imminent danger of falling, leaning
as a result of root failure that puts the tree in imminent danger of falling,
or any other condition that puts the tree in imminent danger of being uprooted
or falling into or along a stream or onto a structure.
   (d)    DEFINED CHANNEL: A natural or man-made depression in the terrain
which is maintained and altered by the water and sediment it carries.

infiltrate water. This may include roads, streets, parking lots, rooftops,
sidewalks and other areas not covered by vegetation.
   (h)    NATURAL SUCCESSION: A gradual and continuous replacement of one kind
of plant and animal group by a more complex group. The plants and animals
present in the initial group modify the environment through their life
activities thereby making it unfavorable for themselves. They are gradually
replaced by a different group of plants and animals better adapted to the new
environment.
   (i)    NOXIOUS WEED: Any plant defined as a "noxious weed and rank
vegetation" in the Codified Ordinances of the City of Reminderville, Ohio.

water from a base flood, which is the flood that has a one percent or greater
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For the purposes of
these regulations, the 100-year Flood Plain shall be defined by FEMA or a site
specific Flood Plain delineation in conformance with standard engineering
practices and approved by the City Engineer.
   (l)   ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK: The point of the bank or shore to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a district
marked by erosion, destruction or prevention of woody terrestrial vegetation,
predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized characteristic.
The ordinary high water mark defines the channel of a stream.
   (m)    POLLUTION: Any contamination or alteration of the physical, chemical,
or biological properties of any waters that will render the waters harmful or
detrimental to: public health, safety or welfare; domestic, commercial,
industrial, agricultural, recreational, or other legitimate beneficial uses;
livestock, wildlife, including birds, fish or other aquatic life.
      (1)    "POINT SOURCE" pollution is traceable to a discrete point or pipe.
      (2)    "NON-POINT SOURCE" pollution is generated by various land use
activities rather than from an identifiable or discrete source, and is conveyed
to waterways through natural processes, such as rainfall, storm runoff, or
ground water seepage rather than direct discharge.
   (n)    PRELIMINARY PLAN: A drawing of a major subdivision for the purpose of
study and which, if approved, permits proceeding with the preparation of the
final plat.
   (o)    RIPARIAN AREA: A transitional area between flowing water and
terrestrial ecosystems, which provides a continuous exchange of nutrients and
woody debris between land and water. This area is at least periodically
influenced by flooding. Riparian areas, if appropriately sized and managed,
help to stabilize banks, limit erosion, reduce flood size flows and/or filter
and settle out runoff pollutants, or perform other functions consistent with
the purposes of these regulations.
   (p)    RIPARIAN SETBACK: The area set back from each bank of a stream to
protect the riparian area and stream from impacts of development, and stream

other alteration of the earth's surface where natural or human made ground
cover is destroyed and which may result in, or contribute to, erosion and
sediment pollution.
   (s)    STREAM: A surface watercourse with a well-defined bed and bank,
either natural or artificial, which confines and conducts continuous or
periodical flowing water (ORC 6105.01) in such a way that terrestrial
vegetation cannot establish roots within the channel.
   (t)    STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP): The plan which
describes all the elements of the stormwater strategy implemented during and
after construction. The plan addresses erosion control and stormwater quality.
   (u)    STORMWATER QUALITY TREATMENT: The removal of pollutants from urban
runoff and improvement of water quality, accomplished largely by deposition and
utilizing the benefits of natural processes.
   (v)    VARIANCE: A modification of the enforcement of the Riparian Setback
chapter which will not be contrary to the public interest and where, due to
conditions peculiar to this property and not the result of the action of the
applicant, a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in undue hardship
to the applicant.
   (w)    WATERCOURSE: A natural or artificial waterway, such as a stream or
river, with a defined bed and channel and a definite direction of course that
is contained within, flows through, or borders the community.
   (x)    WATERSHED: An area of land that drains into a particular watercourse,
usually divided by topography.
   (y)    WETLANDS: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and
similar areas.
(Ord. 35-2004. Passed 12-14-04.)
   1345.05  ESTABLISHMENT OF A RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)    Riparian Setbacks are established as provided in this chapter.
   (b)    Streams addressed by this chapter are those which meet the definition
of "stream" in Section
1345.04 of these regulations and are indicated on at least one of the following
maps:
      (1)    USGS topographical map.
      (2)    Summit County Riparian Setback map.
      (3)    Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for Summit County, Ohio,
USDA, NRCS.
      (4)    Reminderville Storm Water maps and any relocated waterways.
   (c)    Widths of setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance outward
from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are established
as follows:
      (1)    A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)    A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles.
      (3)    A minimum of 75 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.5 square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles.
      (4)    A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to 0.5 square mile (320 acres).
      (5)    A minimum of 25 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
   (d)    The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey stormwater to another system, tile drainage systems,
and stream culverts.
   (e)    The following shall apply to the Riparian Setback:
      (1)    Where the 100-year Flood Plain is wider than the Riparian Setback
on either or both sides of the stream, the Riparian Setback shall be extended
to the outer edge of the 100-year Flood Plain. The 100-year Flood Plain shall
be defined by FEMA and approved by the City Engineer.
      (2)    Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, the following adjustment for steep slopes
will be integrated into the Riparian Setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope        Width of Setback
15% through 20%              Add 25 feet
Greater than 20% through 25% Add 50 feet
Greater than 25%             Add 100 feet
   Average percent slope of the stream bank is to be calculated for the area
within the Riparian Setback and is to be measured as a line perpendicular to
the stream channel at the location where structures or uses are proposed in the
plan. All of the following measurements are to be performed using County of
Summit Geological Information system data (1994, 2000). Calculate slope as
follows: Change in elevation from the edge of stream channel to edge of
Riparian Setback divided by horizontal map distance from the edge of stream
channel to the edge of the Riparian Setback.
      (3)    Where wetlands protected under federal or state law are identified
within the Riparian Setback, the Riparian Setback shall consist of the full
extent of the wetlands plus the following additional setback widths:
         A.    A 50-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 3 wetlands.
         B.    A 30-foot setback extending beyond the outer boundary of a
Category 2 wetlands.
         C.    No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
      (4)    Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate
agencies. All wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the
Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of
application of the regulations.
      (5)    The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the Riparian
Setback, including any expansions or modifications as required by subsections
(b) through (d) hereof, and identifying this setback on all subdivisions, land
development plans, and/or building permit applications. This delineation shall
be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans, or all plans that
are required, or at the time of submission of any permit applications. This
delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the City Engineer. As
the result of this review, the City Engineer may require further studies from
the applicant.
      (6)    Prior to any soil disturbing activity, the Riparian Setback shall
be clearly delineated with properly installed and maintained silt fencing or
other suitable material by the applicant on site, and such delineation shall be
maintained throughout soil-disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be
maintained in an undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these
regulations. All fencing shall be removed when a development project is
completed.
      (7)    No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City of
Reminderville prior to delineation of the Riparian Setback in conformance with
these regulations.
      (8)    Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the Riparian Setback
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the County of Summit.
      (9)    There shall be no permanent loss in the City of Category 3, 2 or
2A wetlands, as determined by the Ohio EPA's ORAM, as a result of the Cuyahoga
River Watershed TMDL, preservation restrictions imposed by the Ohio EPA in
September 2003.
Exception:       Man-made watercraft channels leading to Aurora Lake and
related sections of Aurora Lake have been generally designed to drain storm
water away from the watercourse. The riparian area of these conveyances is
generally limited to less than ten feet of drainage into the watercourse and in
consideration of the fragile condition of the watercourse walls, it may be
necessary to stabilize the channel walls to protect the health, safety,
property and homes of the citizens of the City of Reminderville. (Ord. 35-2004.
Passed 12-14-04.)
   1345.06  USES PERMITTED IN THE RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)    The following uses are permitted by right within the Riparian
Setbacks without prior approval. Open space uses that are passive in character
shall be permitted in the Riparian Setback including, but not limited to, those

of Summit County; the Summit County Health Department; or other technical
experts as necessary.
         A.    Limited crossings of designated streams through the Riparian
Setback by vehicles, storm sewers, sewer and/or water lines, and public utility
lines will be per the approval of local, county, and state governing agencies
and as a part of the regular subdivision review process.
         B.    One driveway crossing per stream per tax parcel will be allowed
for individual landowners.
         C.    Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be designed
and constructed per the City Engineer's design standards and as approved by the
Reminderville Planning and Zoning Commission. If more than two crossings per
1,000 linear feet of stream center is required for these areas, the applicant
must apply for a variance.
         D.    All roadway crossings shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the Riparian Setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)    Placement of stormwater retention or detention facilities may be
considered within the Riparian Setback if:

1346.01  CREATION OF CHAPTER.
   Council hereby creates Chapter
1346 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Reminderville which shall read
as follows.
   (a)   COMMUNITY: Throughout this regulation the Community shall mean the
City of Reminderville, State of Ohio, and its designated agents and
representatives.
   (b)   COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN: The Post-Construction Water
Quality Plan developed to meet this regulation will be coordinated and combined
with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and the Construction Site
Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site. These plans will be
titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part ofthe NPDES Storm Water Permit for General
Construction.
      (Ord. 14-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1346.02  PURPOSE.
   The intent of this regulation is to:
   (a)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water resources
and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or redevelopment
activities.
   (b)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
   (c)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
   (d)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally practical
standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that
will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water
resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Community.
   (e)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities.
   (f)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site.
   (g)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), natural
infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (h)   Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
   (i)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage to
and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
   (j)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address

   (d)   The plan must make use of the practices that preserve the existing
natural condition to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP).
   (e)   To meet the Post-Construction requirements of this regulation, the
Post-Construction Water Quality Plan must contain a description of the Post-
Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) that will be installed during
construction for the site and the rationale for their selection. The rationale
must address the anticipated impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology,
hydrology, and water quality.
   (f)   Structural post-construction BMPs cannot be installed within a State

   (l)   Maintenance plans must ensure that pollutants collected within
structural Post- Construction practices be disposed of in accordance with
local, state, and federal regulations.
   (m)   Maintenance plans must include legally binding perpetual maintenance
easements and agreements. Easement documents must provide for community access.
   (n)   The Post-Construction Plan will also contain the following information
depending on the size of the development sites as well as any additional
information required by the community engineer:
      (1)   Development sites smaller than five acres: A development site that
will disturb one (1) or more, but less than five (5) acres of land and is not a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the decreased storm
water quality that will be caused by the planned development project will be
handled.
         B.   Description of Measures: A description of the BMPs that will be
installed during the construction process to control pollutants in storm water
discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed.
         C.   Upland Areas: Structural measures placed on upland areas to the
degree attainable.
         D.   Map: A map of the entire site showing the overall development.

prior to the start of construction.
         F.   BMPs: Best Management Practices used in the Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan may include but are not limited to:
            1.   Permanent Storm Water Detention ponds that provide extended
detention of the water volume.
            2.   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions.
            3.   Onsite infiltration of runoff.
            4.   Sequential systems that combine several practices.
            5.   Permanent conservation easements, preferably with the easement
being held by a third party with no vested interest in ever seeing the property
developed.
            6.   Natural Channel Design for drainage ways.
            7.   Bioengineering in drainage ways.
            8.   Recreating floodplains.
            9.   Chemical and biological filters in storm sewer inlets.

            15.   Aquatic benches in Retention Basins and ponds.
         G.   Technical Basis: The plan will contain a statement of the
rationale utilized to select the BMPs used to control pollution and to maintain
and protect water quality.
      (2)   Development sites 5 acres or larger: A development site that
disturbs five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5)
acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will
disturb five (5) or more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
         B.   Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745- 1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to the
following equation:
            1.   WQv = C * P * A I 12 where: WQv =water quality volume in acre-
feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (either
using Table 1 or the following formula: C=0.858i - 0. 78i2 + 0. 774i + 0.04
where i=fraction of post-construction impervious area) P = 0.75 inch
precipitation depth A= area draining into the BMP in acres.
 
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
 
         D.   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
         E.   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA
         F.   The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard
BMPs approved for general use. However, communities with a regulated MS4 may
limit the use of some of these BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain
time is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage
available for successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance
conditions. The outlet structure for the post-construction BMP must not
discharge more than the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the
drain time.

         G.   The owner may request approval from the Community Engineer to use
alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vender supplied Post-Construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
         H.   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural

developed property), Post- Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. Where projects are a
combination of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be
treated shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the
new development at 100 percent WQv and redevelopment at 20 percent Wqv.

            (Ord. 14-2013. Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1346.09  EASEMENTS.
   Future access to all permanent vegetative and/or mechanical Post-
Construction water quality conservation practices (BMPs) and other areas, as
required by the Community Engineer, shall be secured by means of perpetual
easements.
   (a)   The easements shall be recorded in the name of the Community and, in
single-family residential developments, the homeowners association. Recorded
easements must provide for community access.
   (b)   Such easements shall be not less than twenty-five (25) feet in width,

ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk for
loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related
to imminent failure as determined by the Community Engineer: A written and
stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or Certified
Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction. (Ord. 14-2013.
Passed 3-12-13.)
 
1346.11 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control pollution of water resources, the owner or person
responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   Standards and Specifications: Post-Construction runoff practices used
to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county, or the Ohio EPA, whichever is most
stringent. The construction of new roads and roadway improvement projects by
public entities shall implement Post-Construction BMPs in compliance with the
current version of the Ohio Department of Transportation's Location and Design
Manual. Volume Two: Drainage Design that has been accepted by Ohio EPA
   (b)   Water Quality Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the Water Quality and the Storm Water
Management Basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
hand wheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and
specifications for the office serving the local county. Each principal spillway
shall have the capacity to pass the 100 year design storm flows. The inlet or
riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the
structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into
orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall
be no less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe
is required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location.
Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
Water Quality and Storm Water Management basin. Emergency spillways shall
convey flood flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in
accordance with NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the
local county. Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity
unless exempted in writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3: 1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be incorporated
into the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)   Water Quality Basin: If a Water Quality Basin is needed and cannot
be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin then a
separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained into perpetuity.
      (10)   Water Quality Basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (11)   Flexibility: These standards are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional and/
or more stringent requirements nor shall the standards limit the right of the
Community Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
         A.   If the Community Engineer waives, in writing, individual
requirements the owner will provide the Community Engineer with the information
and documentation required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived requirement will
not degrade water quality.

   The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate BMPs for
each construction operation. Prior to the start of grading and within seven
days from the start of grubbing the applicant must implement such controls. The
SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s) responsible for
implementation. The time frame for SWP3 implementation shall be consistent with
the current Ohio EPA NPDES Construction permit.
   (a)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without a SWP3 or
Abbreviated SWP3 approved by the City of Reminderville.
   (b)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without a pre-
construction meeting being held with the City Engineer. It will be the

   The controls shall include the minimum components set forth in Sections
1348.10.1 and
1348.10.2.
(Ord. 2-2007. Passed 3-13-07.)
   1348.10.1 ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION CONTROLS.
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The applicant must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
      (1)   Stream protection. The requirements of the City of Reminderville
Riparian Setback Ordinance (Chapter
1345, inclusive) shall be followed.
      (2)   Wetland protection. The setback requirements of the City of
Reminderville Regulations shall be followed in addition to State and Federal
regulations.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The applicant must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A
description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after
grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The applicant must make use of measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices may include,
among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
   (e)   Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in storm
water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices to
prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. An initial inspection of all erosion and
sediment control practices shall be conducted by the project engineer to
certify that the installations comply with the approved SWP3 pursuant to the
City of Reminderville’s Regulations. All controls on the site shall be
inspected by the applicant’s agent at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to
conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional
and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control
measures are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with
knowledge and experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and
erosion controls. Internal inspections and documentation of corrective actions
taken must be made available upon request.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the City Engineer.
   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed
   (j)   Final Stabilization. All soil disturbing activities are complete and a
uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent coverage for
the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures. In addition, all temporary erosion and sediment control
practices are removed and disposed of in an acceptable manner.
(Ord. 2-2007. Passed 3-13-07.)
   1348.10.2 POST CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PRACTICES.
   (a)   Non-structural Water Quality Practices: Non-structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
      (1)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected from
disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
      (2)   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed to potential
buyers.
   (b)   Structural Water Quality Practices:  Structural post construction best
management practices are permanent features constructed to provide treatment of
storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or infiltration.
      (1)   All structural water quality practices must be established prior to
the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control during development
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
      (2)   Maintenance. The post construction water quality practice must be
maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWPPP or the Storm
Water Management Maintenance Agreement.

suit instituted against any officer or employee because of an act performed by
that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties and under the

or any subordinate shall not be liable for costs in an action, suit or
proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the provisions of this code; and

code.

authority as necessary in the interest of public health, safety and general
welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules and procedures; to interpret and
implement the provisions of this code; to secure the intent thereof; and to
designate requirements applicable because of local climatic or other
conditions. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving structural or fire
performance requirements specifically provided for in this code, or of
violating accepted engineering methods involving public safety or varying any
provision of the Zoning Code of the City of Reminderville.
      (3)    Inspections. The code official shall make all of the required
inspections, or shall accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or
individuals. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing and be
certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the
responsible individual. The code official is authorized to engage such expert
opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that arise,
subject to the approval of the appointing authority.
      (4)    Right of entry. The code official is authorized to enter the
structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect subject to constitutional
restrictions on unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not

duties under this code.

notices or orders to ensure compliance with this code.

this code. Such records shall be retained in the official records as long as
the building or structure to which such records relate remains in existence,
unless otherwise provided for by other regulations.
      (8)    Coordination of inspections. Whenever in the enforcement of this
code or another code or ordinance, the responsibility of more than one code
official of the jurisdiction is involved, it shall be the duty of the code
officials involved to coordinate their inspections and administrative orders as
fully as practicable so that the owners and occupants of the structure shall
not be subjected to visits by numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting
orders. Whenever an inspector from any agency or department observes an
apparent or actual violation of some provision of some law, ordinance or code
not within the inspector's authority to enforce, the inspector shall report the
findings to the code official having jurisdiction.
 
   (e)   APPROVALS.
      (1)    Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved
in carrying out the provisions of this code, the code official shall have the
authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided the code
official shall first find that special individual reason makes the strict
letter of this code impractical and the modification is in compliance with the
intent and purpose of this code and that such modification does not lessen
health, life and fire safety requirements. The details of action granting
modifications shall be recorded and entered in the department files.
      (2)    Alternative materials, methods and equipment. The provisions of
this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to
prohibit any method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code,
provided that any such alternative has been approved. An alternative material
or method of construction shall be approved where the code official finds that
the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the
provisions of this code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for
the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code
in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety.
      (3)    Required testing. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of
compliance with the provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or
method does not conform to the requirements of this code, or in order to
substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the code official
shall have the authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance
at no expense to the jurisdiction.
         A.   Test methods. Test methods shall be as specified in this code or
by other recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted
test methods, the code official shall be permitted to approve appropriate
testing procedures performed by an approved agency.
         B.   Test reports. Reports of tests shall be retained by the code
official for the period required for retention of public records.
      (4)    Material and equipment reuse. Materials, equipment and devices

reconditioned and tested when necessary, placed in good and proper working
condition and approved.

deemed guilty of a third degree misdemeanor, and the violation shall be deemed
a strict liability offense. If the notice of violation is not complied with,
the code official shall institute the appropriate proceeding at law or in
equity to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to require the removal
or termination of the unlawful occupancy of the structure in violation of the
provisions of this code or of the order or direction made pursuant thereto. Any
action taken by the authority having jurisdiction on such premises shall be
charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall
be a lien upon such real estate.
      (4)    Violation penalties. (deleted)
      (5)    Abatement of violation. The imposition of the penalties herein
prescribed shall not preclude the legal officer of the jurisdiction from
instituting appropriate action to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises, or to stop an
illegal act, conduct, business or utilization of the building, structure or
premises.

provisions of the compliance order or notice of violation have been complied
with, or until such owner shall first furnish the grantee, transferee,

   (h)   UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT.
      (1)    General. When a structure or equipment is found by the code
official to be unsafe, or when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy,
or is found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to the
provisions of this code.
         A.   Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect or
warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure contains unsafe
equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete
collapse is possible.
         B.   Unsafe equipment.  Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable
liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the structure
which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to
life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.
         C.   Structure unfit for human occupancy. A structure is unfit for
human occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or to the public.
         D.   Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole
or in part to be occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or
was erected, altered or occupied contrary to law.
      (2)    Closing of vacant structures. If the structure is vacant and unfit
for human habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural
collapse, the code official is authorized to post a placard of condemnation on
the premises and order the structure closed up so as not to be an attractive
nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises within the time
specified in the order, the code official shall cause the premises to be closed
and secured through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement
by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real
estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real
estate and may be collected by any other legal resource.
      (3)    Notice. Whenever the code official has condemned a structure or
equipment under the provisions of this section, notice shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in or about the structure affected by such notice and served
on the owner or the person or persons responsible for the structure or
equipment in accordance with Section 107.3. If the notice pertains to
equipment, it shall also be placed on the condemned equipment. The notice shall
be in the form prescribed in Section 107.2.
      (4)    Placarding. Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to
comply with the notice provisions within the time given, the code official
shall post on the premises or on defective equipment a placard bearing the word
"Condemned" and a statement of the penalties provided for occupying the
premises, operating the equipment or removing the placard.
         A.   Placard removal. The code official shall remove the condemnation
placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and
placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or
removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the code official shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this code.
      (5)    Prohibited occupancy. Any occupied structure condemned and
placarded by the code official shall be vacated as ordered by the code
official. Any person who shall occupy a placarded premise or shall operate
placarded equipment, and any owner or any person responsible for the premises
who shall let anyone occupy a placarded premise or operate placarded equipment
shall be liable for the penalties provided by this code.
 
   (i)   EMERGENCY MEASURES.
      (1)    Imminent danger. When, in the opinion of the code official, there
is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure which
endangers life, or when any structure or part of a structure has fallen and
life is endangered by the occupation of the structure, or when there is actual
or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the proximity of any
structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of
toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or dangerous
equipment, the code official is hereby authorized and empowered to order and
require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith. The code official shall
cause to be posted at each entrance to such structure a notice reading as
follows: "This Structure Is Unsafe and Its Occupancy Has Been Prohibited by the
Code Official." It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure
except for the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs,
removing the hazardous condition or of demolishing the same.
      (2)    Temporary safeguards. Notwithstanding other provisions of this
code, whenever, in the opinion of the code official, there is imminent danger
due to an unsafe condition, the code official shall order the necessary work to
be done, including the boarding up of openings, to render such structure
temporarily safe whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been
instituted; and shall cause such other action to be taken as the code official
deems necessary to meet such emergency.
      (3)    Closing streets. When necessary for public safety, the code
official shall temporarily close structures and close, or order the authority
having jurisdiction to close, sidewalks, streets, public ways and places
adjacent to unsafe structures, and prohibit the same from being utilized.
      (4)    Emergency repairs. For the purposes of this section, the code
official shall employ the necessary labor and materials to perform the required
work as expeditiously as possible.
      (5)    Costs of emergency repairs. Costs incurred in the performance of
emergency work shall be paid by the jurisdiction. The legal counsel of the
jurisdiction shall institute appropriate action against the owner of the
premises where the unsafe structure is or was located for the recovery of such
costs.
      (6)    Hearing. (amended) Any person ordered to take emergency measures
shall comply with such order forthwith. Any affected person shall thereafter,
upon petition directed to the Board of Zoning Appeals, be afforded a hearing as
described in this code.
 
   (j)   DEMOLITION.
      (1)    General.(amended) The code official shall order the owner of any
premises upon which is located any structure, which in the code official's
judgment is so old, dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to be
dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation or
occupancy, and such that it is unreasonable to repair the structure, to
demolish and remove such structure; or if such structure is capable of being
made safe by repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary or to demolish and
remove at the owner's option; or where there has been a cessation of normal
construction of any structure for a period of more than six months, to demolish
and remove such structure.
      (2)    Notices and orders. All notices and orders shall comply with
Section 107.
      (3)    Failure to comply. If the owner of a premises fails to comply with
a demolition order within the time prescribed, the code official shall cause
the structure to be demolished and removed, either through an available public
agency or by contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost of such
demolition and removal shall be charged against the real estate upon which the
structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.
      (4)    Salvage materials. When any structure has been ordered demolished
and removed, the governing body or other designated officer under said contract
or arrangement aforesaid shall have the right to sell the salvage and valuable
materials at the highest price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after
deducting the expenses of such demolition and removal, shall be promptly
remitted with a report of such sale or transaction, including the items of
expense and the amounts deducted, for the person who is entitled thereto,
subject to any order of a court. If such a surplus does not remain to be turned
over, the report shall so state.
 
   (k)   MEANS OF APPEAL.
      (1)    Application for appeal. (amended) Any person directly affected by
a decision of the code official or a notice or order issued under this code

days after the day the decision, notice or order was served. An application for
