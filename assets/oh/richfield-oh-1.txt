   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Richfield has had the matter of
recodification and general revision of its ordinances before it for some time;
and
 
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification; and
 
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council;
therefore,
   BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Richfield, Ohio:
 
Section 1:    That the ordinances of the Village of Richfield, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of
Richfield, Ohio, 1974; save and except for Part Three - Traffic Code, and Part
Five - General Offenses Code, which parts were adopted by Ordinance 19-1974,
passed January 15, 1974.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of
Richfield, Ohio.
Section 2:    That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to November 6, 1974, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

123.01. All sections of the Codified Ordinances without a previous ordinance or
resolution history at the end thereof indicate that the sections contain new
matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
 
Section 4:    This Ordinance is determined to be an emergency measure necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety that is to
facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid practical and legal
entanglements, and provided this Ordinance receives the affirmative vote of
two-thirds of the members elected or appointed, it shall take effect and be in
force from and after its approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it shall take effect

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Richfield has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Richfield ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Richfield, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the
laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and
consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does
not waive right to jury trial, then the magistrate shall require the accused to
enter into recognizance to appear before a court of record in Summit County
(Akron Municipal Court), and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers
filed, together with a transcript or proceedings and accrued costs to date, and
such recognizance, if given, to the court of record.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is the later. Failure to claim jury trial as provided herein is a
complete waiver of right thereto. Jury trial may not be had in courts not of
record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial
may be asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of
record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Richfield ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, pursuant to the authority granted it under Ohio
R.C. 2935.17 and 2937.46 has amended the "Rules of Practice and Procedure in
Traffic Cases for All Courts Inferior to Common Pleas". The amended rules,
styled as the "Ohio Traffic Rules" become effective January 1, 1975.

         B.   If any portion of the profits of the S corporation are allocated
or apportioned to the State of Ohio, the full amount of the distributive share
is taxable.
         C.   Resident S corporations and non-resident S corporations doing
business within the Village shall, on behalf of each shareholder, collect and
remit the tax due on the distributive shares in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter and the rules and regulations.
   (b)   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation, and with respect
to the net profits of businesses, professions or other activities earned and/or
received during the effective period of this chapter on and after July 1, 1969.

(Ord. 17-2006. Passed 3-17-06.)
191.04 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village of Richfield for purposes of income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village of Richfield, during the taxable period, to the average original cost
of all real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, real property includes property rented
or leased by the taxpayer, and the value of such property shall be determined
by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village of Richfield to wages, salaries and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed. Wages, salaries, and other compensation
shall be included to the extent that they represent qualifying wages.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village of Richfield to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in Section
191.04(a)(3), “sales made in the Village of Richfield,” means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Richfield, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within the Village of Richfield.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Richfield regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through his own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the Village of Richfield and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of Richfield to purchasers outside the Village
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through his own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
      (4)   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
191.04 (a)(1), (2) and (3), or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving this total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in Section
191.04(a). A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in
or outside the Village of Richfield.
   (c)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
191.03(a)(3), (4) and (5), only if and to the extent that the rental ownership,
management or operations of the real estate from which such rentals are
derived, whether so rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually, or
through agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part. Landlords must furnish a list of tenants’ names,
addresses and phone numbers when requested by the Administrator, but not more
often than once a year.
      (1)   Where gross monthly rental of any and all properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that, in the case of commercial property the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month.
      (2)   In the case of farm property the owner shall be considered engaged
in a business activity when he share in crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net profits derived from the farm, whether or not
the gross income exceeds the two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
      (3)   A person who operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered
in business whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty ($250.00)
per month.
   (d)   Operating loss carryforward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to July 1, 1969, allocable to the Village of Richfield, may be
applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to
the Village until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years
immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village of Richfield in the same manner as provided herein for allocating
net profits to the Village.
      (3)   Business losses cannot be used to offset Federal W-2 salaries,
wages and other compensation.
      (4)   The Administrator shall provide by rules and regulations, the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

191.06 RETURNS.
   (a)   Except as herein provided each taxpayer shall, for years prior to
taxable year 2004, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a return
on or before April 30 of the year following the effective date of this chapter
(July 1, 1969), and on or before April 30 of each year thereafter, and on or
before April 15th for taxable years 2004 and later. When the return is made for
a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed within four months from the end of such fiscal year or period
for years prior to taxable year 2004, and within 105 days for taxable years
2004 and later. A retiree having no taxable income to the Village of Richfield
shall be exempt from these filing requirements, and any subsequent filings,
upon noting this exemption on the most recent annual return received by the

Richfield, the retiree shall again be required to comply with the provisions of
this chapter, including the filing requirements.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Administrator or on other
forms deemed acceptable by the Administrator, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of income, salaries, wages, commissions and

      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Administrator requires, including but not limited to copies
of all W-2 forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, and all applicable federal
schedules.
   (c)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for filing of the Federal income tax return for taxable years prior to
2004. For taxable year 2004 the extended due date shall be the last day of the
month following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax
return has been extended. For taxable years subsequent to 2004 the extended due
date shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended. The Administrator may require a tentative
return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by
the date the return is normally due. No penalty or interest shall be assessed
in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the
period extended. The Administrator may deny the extension if the taxpayer’s
income tax account with the Village is delinquent in any way.
   (d)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code, may
file a consolidated return with the Village of Richfield. However, once the
affiliated group has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return
with the village, the affiliated group may not change their method of filing in
any subsequent tax year without written approval from the Village.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
of Richfield constituting a portion only of its total business, the
Administrator shall require such additional information as he deems necessary
to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated the Village of
Richfield. If the Administrator finds that the profits are not properly
allocated the Village by reason of transactions with stockholders or other
corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he shall make such allocation as he deems
appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the
Village.
   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay an additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements, limitations or both, contained in
Sections
 191.09 and
 191.10. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for the filing of the original
return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s Village of Richfield tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability
and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (f)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.

191.07 PAYMENT OF TAX, COLLECTION AT SOURCE, AND DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,

however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the
source pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.07(c), or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.07(f), or whether an income tax has been paid to another municipality or
Joint Economic Development District, credit for the amount so paid in
accordance with Section
191.10 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing this return.
   (b)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village of
Richfield is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election, so indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar and one-cent ($1.01) shall be collected or refunded.
   (c)   Collection at Source.
      (1)   In accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the Village of
Richfield shall deduct at the time of payment of such income, salary, wages,
commissions or other compensation, the tax of two percent (2%) per annum of the
gross receipts, income, salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due
by the employer to such employee and shall make a return and pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted, subject to the provisions of
subsections (2)A., B., and (3) hereof. Such returns shall be on a form or forms
prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject to the
rules and regulations prescribed therefore by the Administrator. Such employer
shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld
whether or not such taxes in fact have been withheld.
      (2)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the
same until payment is made by such employer to the Village of Richfield, as a
trustee for the benefit of the Village and any such tax collected by such
employer from his employees, shall, until the same is paid the Village be
deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
         A.   Such employer who deducts the tax in an amount of two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) or more in any month shall, on or before the 20th day
of the following month, pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so
deducted. Such employer shall then continue to deduct and remit taxes on a
monthly basis. However, an employer required to file monthly can subsequently
request permission of the Administrator in writing to file on a quarterly
basis. The request shall include the employer’s justification for filing on a
quarterly basis. The Administrator shall, in writing, approve or deny the
request.
         B.   Such employer who makes payment on a quarterly basis shall pay
such tax deducted by the 20th of the month following the end of the quarter.
      (3)   The payment shall be on a form or forms furnished by or obtainable
from the Administrator upon request, setting forth the amount of tax deducted
for the month or quarter.
   (d)   The employer of a domestic servant shall be required to withhold the
tax on wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed by him
exclusively in such employer’s residence.
   (e)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the Village
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service, shall provide
the Village the names and addresses of the subcontractors. The subcontractors
shall be responsible for all income tax withholding requirements under this
chapter.
   (f)   Declarations.
      (1)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not
subject to Section
191.07(c), or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
191.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon. If a person’s income is wholly from wages from which
the tax will be withheld and remitted to the Village of Richfield in accordance
with Section
191.07(c), such person need not file a declaration.
      (2)   The declaration required by Section
191.07(f)(1) above shall be filed on or before April 30th of each year, and on
or before April 15th for taxable years 2005 and later, during the effective
period set forth in Section
191.03(b), except that no penalties or interest shall be assessed, for not
filing a declaration, on any resident taxpayer who was not domiciled in the
Village on the first day of January of the year in which they became subject to
estimated payments, nor shall penalties or interest be assessed on estimated
payments if the taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to one hundred percent of
the previous year's tax liability, provided that the previous year reflected a
twelve-month period.
      (3)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the beginning of each fiscal year and
within 105 days for taxable years 2005 and later.
      (4)   The declaration required by Section
191.07(f) shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable from the
Administrator or on other forms deemed acceptable by the Administrator;
provided, however, credit shall be taken for Village of Richfield tax to be
withheld from any portion of such income. In accordance with the provisions of
Section
191.10, credit may be taken for tax to be paid or to be withheld and remitted
to another taxing municipality or Joint Economic Development District.
      (5)   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
      (6)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the Village by
individuals shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of 90% of
the estimated annual tax and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or
before July 31st and October 31st of the taxable year, and January 31st of
following year. Provided, however, that in case an amended declaration has been
filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments
on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (7)   Effective January 1, 2003, such declaration of estimated tax to be
paid to the Village by corporations and associations shall be accompanied by a
payment of at least one-fourth of ninety percent (90%) of the estimated annual
tax and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before June 15, September
15 and December 15. In the case of a fiscal year taxpayer the second, third,

(Ord. 17-2006. Passed 3-17-06.)
191.08 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be withheld

and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator; and
provided further, that, in absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall
be assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit,
providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within
three months after a final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Administrator, the Board of Review may
abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from the refusal of the
Administrator to recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board may
nevertheless abate penalty or interest, or both, for good cause shown.
   (e)   Violations. No person shall:

   (g)   All prosecutions under this chapter must be commenced within time
limits specified by Ohio R.C. 718.12.
   (h)   The failure of any employer or person to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from making any
information return, return or declaration, from filing such form, or from
paying the tax.
(Ord. 17-2006. Passed 3-17-06.)
191.09 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. Except in the case of fraud, omission of a substantial portion of
income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the time the return was due
or filed, whichever is later. In the case of fraud, omission of twenty-five
percent (25%) or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a
return, all additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to
recover Village of Richfield income taxes and penalties and interest thereon
shall be brought within six (6) years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later. In those cases in which a commissioner of Internal
Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of
limitations, the period within which, an additional assessment may be made by
the Administrator shall be one year from the time of the final determination of
the Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after the final determination of the
Federal tax liability, whichever is later. However, the following shall apply
regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred compensation
plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Richfield, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Richfield as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds. Income tax that should have been deposited with the Village of
Richfield, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the Village of Richfield. The Village of Richfield will allow a
non-refundable credit for any amount owed the Village of Richfield that is in
excess of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the
tax rate of the other municipality is the same or higher than the Village of
Richfield’s tax rate. If the Village of Richfield’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by
the Village of Richfield.
   (d)   Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a
corporation or association shall be personally liable for failure to file the
return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required. The
dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any employer does not discharge
the officers’ or employees’ liability for a prior failure of such business to
file a return or pay the taxes due.
   (e)   Amounts of less than one dollar and one-cent ($1.01) shall not be
collected or refunded. (Ord. 17-2006. Passed 3-17-06.)
191.10 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   When a resident of the Village of Richfield is subject to a municipal
income tax in another municipality or Joint Economic Development District he
shall not pay a total municipal income tax on the same income greater than the
tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (b)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village of Richfield but
receives net profits, income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, other
personal service compensation, or a distributive share of net profits from a
resident or nonresident unincorporated business entity of which he is a partner

earned in such other municipality or municipalities or Joint Economic
Development Districts where such tax is paid.

another municipality or Joint Economic Development District, such Richfield

payments thereof.
   (c)   The Administrator is charged with the enforcement of this chapter and

conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter. Failure to make any

191.08 (e) shall apply.
   (e)   Authority to determine amount of tax due.

of Richfield from the taxpayer, and shall send to such taxpayer a written
statement showing the amount of tax so determined together with interest and
penalties thereon, if any.

Administrator may extend the date of hearing for good cause shown. After the
hearing the Administrator shall withdraw the assessment or shall adjust or
reaffirm the assessment and it shall then become final. If no protest is filed
as herein provided, such proposed assessment shall become final fifteen days
after being served.
      (3)   A taxpayer shall have thirty days after the date the final
assessment was served or mailed within which to file written notice of appeal
with the Board of Review, and the appeal shall be handled in accordance with
Section
191.15. If no protest is filed as herein provided, such proposed assessment
shall become final thirty days after being served.
   (f)   The Administrator, or any authorized employee, is hereby authorized to
examine the books, papers, records and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to or whom the Administrator
believes is subject to the provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer, supposed

State income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him, whether
as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of
such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (h)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal income tax
return, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or persons
subject or presumed subject to the tax, or by any officer, agent or employee of
a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the failure of any
person to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with an order or
subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
191.08(e).
   (i)   Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or otherwise authorized by this chapter
shall be confidential except for official tax purposes, or except in accordance
with proper judicial order. Whoever divulges such information in violation of
this section shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
imprisoned not more than six months, or both. Each disclosure shall constitute
a separate offense.
   In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the Village of Richfield
who violates this section relative to disclosures of confidential information
shall be punished by immediate dismissal.
   (j)   Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute his tax
liability for a period of six years from the date his return is filed, or the
withholding taxes are paid.

any other municipal corporation, firm or private corporation to permit such
other corporation to act as agent for the Village for the purpose of
administering the Village income tax laws and providing a central collection
facility for the collection of the income tax on behalf of the Village of
Richfield. Such agreement shall be approved by Council.

agreement with any other municipal corporation, firm or private corporation, to

192.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this chapter, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this Chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of
intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition
of property described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (ii)   Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (F)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (G)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code.

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H)
of this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by
division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation

available must be utilized before a taxpayer may deduct any amount pursuant to
division (1)(H) of this section.
         (v)    Nothing in division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section. To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.
      (I)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable

the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section

made the election described in division (47)(B) of this section, is not a
publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division
(23)(D) of this section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (1) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.

   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or

equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
192.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00).
         (c)   Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
(15) days after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this Chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
192.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in section

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer
paid qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty (20) days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
192.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
192.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve (12) or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the
employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes
a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on
those days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for
tax on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this
division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve (12) days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth (10th) day of each month, the casino
operator shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January, a
casino operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located, indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual
return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously
remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January, a
casino operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect
to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth (10th) day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January,
each video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return
electronically with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which
the facility is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld
during the preceding calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld
and that was not previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security
number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of January, a
video lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;    
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
 
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent (50%) of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not
filed or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and
withheld at the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section 192.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for
whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
192.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
192.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
 192.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
192.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
 192.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
192.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B)(1) and (I) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
 192.052 of this Chapter.
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
192.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
192.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
192.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) of Section
192.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
192.051 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (B) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(B)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (1)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (B)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (B)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (B)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (B)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
192.051 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 93-2023. Passed 12-5-23.)
192.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
192.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for

 192.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 192.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
 192.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
192.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
192.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

192.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal

         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as

amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth (9th) month

         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth (12th)
month of the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth (4th) month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
192.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and

following the end of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for

percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with the municipal corporation under Section
192.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

192.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
192.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)    When a resident of the Village is subject to a municipal income tax
in another municipality or Joint Economic Development District he shall not pay
a total municipal income tax on the same income greater than the tax imposed at
the higher rate.
   (b)    Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village but receives net
profits, income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, other personal
service compensation, or a distributive share of net profits from a resident or
nonresident unincorporated business entity of which he is a partner or owner,
for work done, or services performed or rendered outside of the Village, if it
appears that he or such business entity has paid a municipal income tax on or
with respect to the same income taxable under this Chapter to another
municipality or Joint Economic Development District, shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this Chapter in the amount so paid by him, in his
behalf or by such business entity, to such other municipality or Joint Economic
Development District. In no event, however, shall any such municipal income tax
or Joint Economic Development District income tax to the extent paid to another
municipality or Joint Economic Development District and allowed as a credit
hereunder be deductible in computing the net profit of such taxpayer or such
business entity. In addition, such credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by
this Chapter on such income earned in such other municipality or municipalities
or Joint Economic Development Districts where such tax is paid.
   (c)     In the event a Village resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid
another municipality or Joint Economic Development District, such Village
resident is required to file a return or form in such manner as the

192.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
192.081 of this Chapter.

192.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 192.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
192.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
192.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
192.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.

the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
192.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
  
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
 192.052 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter. The application
shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
 
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of
the tenth (10th) month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of the Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
 
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this Chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A, (B), (C), or (E) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.
(Ord. 93-2023. Passed 12-5-23.)
192.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
192.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
192.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
                (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars ($10.00).
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in division (A)(4) of Section
192.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
   (D)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this Chapter;
   (E)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;

      (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
    (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount
payable to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six (6)
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to section
192.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
192.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty (30) days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
192.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
192.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
192.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
    (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
192.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)     Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
(60) days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the
Tax Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.    
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
       (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty (60) days after
the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under
division (C) of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to
prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the
taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney
at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may
allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a
case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the board's final
hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary
mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing
the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the
board's final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
192.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
192.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
192.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
 192.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 72-2015. Passed 11-17-15.)
192.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

192.21 LANDLORD REPORTING.

rent or otherwise lease the same, or any part thereof, to any person for
residential dwelling purposes, including apartments, rooms and other rental

effective date of this section, shall file with the Tax Administrator on or
before the January 31 first following such calendar year a written report
disclosing the name, address and also telephone number, if available, of each
tenant known to have occupied on December 31 during such calendar year such
apartment, room or other residential dwelling rental property.
 
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may order the appearance before him, or his
duly authorized agent, of any person whom he believes to have any knowledge of
the name, address and telephone number of any tenant of residential rental real
property in the Municipality. The Tax Administrator, or his duly authorized
agent, is authorized to examine any person, under oath, concerning the name,
address and telephone number of any tenant of residential real property located
in the Municipality. The Tax Administrator, or his duly authorized agent, may
compel the production of papers and records and the attendance of all persons
before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such person
has knowledge of the name, address and telephone number of any tenant of
residential real property in the Municipality.

following shall be subject to Section
192.99 of this Chapter:

required by subsection (A) hereof; or
      (2)    Makes an incomplete or intentionally false written report required
by subsection (A) hereof; or
      (3)    Fails to appear before the Tax Administrator or any duly

termination of the election.
         (B)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (C)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions
set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (c)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (d)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
192.03 (44) of the Village Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2201 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703 of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and section
192.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (a)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
192.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (b)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
192.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (A)    Except as provided in division (b)(4)(B) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (B)    Division (b)(4)(A) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of
section
192.2206 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of section
192.2206 of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in section 718.01 (L) (2) of the revised code, and
is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in
section 718.01 (D) (5) of the revised code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
192.03 tt (1)of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter
5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or
trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a
taxpayer.
   (d)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of
an aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes.
The tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
192.2210 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2202 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under section
192.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (A)    Separate accounting;
         (B)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (D)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of section
192.2210 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of section
192.2210 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (c)    As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)    The employer;
         (B)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)    For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (e)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under section 718.01 of the revised code, the taxpayer shall add the
amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (g)    When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2203 INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATOR; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by sections
192.22 to

disclose such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a
proper judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the
Revised Code. The tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service
with copies of returns filed. This section does not prohibit the publication of

apportionable to the Village under this chapter for any prior year:
      (1)    The taxpayer's name, address, and federal employer identification
number;
      (2)    The taxpayer's apportionment ratio for, and amount of municipal
taxable income apportionable to, the Village pursuant to section
192.2202 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    The amount of any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward

   (c)    Not later than thirty days after each distribution made to municipal
corporations under section 718.83 of the Revised Code, the tax commissioner
shall provide to the Village a report stating the name and federal
identification number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are
attributable to the Village and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated
payment.
   (d)    The information described under divisions (b) and (c) of this section
shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the Village
tax commissioner under section 718.83(D) of the Revised Code.
   (e)   (1)   The Village expects that the tax commissioner will, pursuant to
section 718.84(E) of the Revised Code, provide tax returns and other
information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax commissioner shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (b) and (c) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    if the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax commissioner under this section, the Village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2204 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under section
192.2208 of the Codified Ordinances, shall be submitted to the tax
commissioner, on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or
before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with sections
192.2201,
192.2202, and, if applicable,
192.2206 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
   (b)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall

information.
         (B)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (c)   (1)   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (B)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (C)    An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section
192.012 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers who
have made the election under section
192.22 of the codified ordinances to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise required to
file annual returns.
   (e)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (f)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. (Ord. 19-
2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2205 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section

manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (b)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (b)(1) or (2) of section
192.063 (b) (1) (2) of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax
commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (c)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
192.2201 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (b) of section
192.2201 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (A)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
192.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
192.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (A)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
192.2202 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (f)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
192.2202 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2207 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2208 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (A)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (A)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (B)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (A)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (C)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2209 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within
the time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (A)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (B)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon
which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains
information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially
incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position
that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or
impede the administration of sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars
may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
192.2211 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
192.2210 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (b)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2210 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a taxpayer
more than three years after the later of the date the return subject to
assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such time
limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
192.2211 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (b)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (d)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
192.2211 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided
by that section. (Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2211 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (a) of section
192.2210 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (c)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2212 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
192.2210 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
192.2211 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section
192.2211 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2213 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy
of any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (b)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
192.22 to
192.2215 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 19-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
192.2214 CREDITS.
   (a)    A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of the Village pursuant
to section 718.15 or 718.151 of the revised code Codified Ordinances, shall be
available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
192.22 of the Codified Ordinances, against the municipal corporation's tax on
income. A municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the
tax commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-
first day of January of the first year in which the taxpayer is eligible to

      (2)    A copy of the ordinance or resolution authorizing the agreement
entered into between the Village and the taxpayer.
   (b)   (1)    Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the Village granting the credit
that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the credit, the amount of the
credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of the
Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.

192.2215 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   (a)    Except as provided in division (b) of this section, whoever

first degree and shall be subject to a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars or imprisonment for a term of up to six months, or both.

193.01 DEFINITIONS.
   When used in the chapter and unless otherwise distinctly expressed, the
following words and phrases shall have the meanings set out herein:
   (a)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)    "Director of Finance" means the Director of Finance of the Village of
Richfield.
   (c)    "Hotel" or "motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more
rooms are used for accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one
or several structures.
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty days.
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise including all receipts, cash,
credits, and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount
for which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction
therefrom whatsoever.
   (f)    "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel or
motel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in
possession, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions
through a managing agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the
managing agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter,
and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance
with provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent,
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (g)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel or
motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes presently located within the
Village. The use or possession or right to use or possess any room or any suite
of connecting rooms as office space, banquet or private dining rooms, or
exhibit, sample or display space shall not be considered occupancy within the
meaning of this definition unless the person exercising occupancy uses or
possesses, or has the right to use or possess all or any portion of such room
or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
      (Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village of Richfield, for the use of the general fund of the Village, there
is hereby levied a tax of three percent (3%) on all rents received by a hotel
or motel for lodging furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the
Village, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for
the Village, or to the Village.
   (c)    The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or
motel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guests ceasing to occupy space in the hotel
or motel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel or motel, the Director of Finance may require that such tax shall be paid
directly to the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 6-1996. Passed 3-5-96.)
193.03 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)    Upon rents not within the taxing power of the Village, under the
constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States;
      (2)    Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions.
   
   (b)    No exemption claimed under subsection (a) hereof shall be granted
except upon claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty
of perjury upon a form prescribed by the Director of Finance. All claims of
exemption shall be made in the manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.04 PROHIBITION AGAINST FALSE EVIDENCE.
   (a)    No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as
required by the chapter, or present to the operator false evidence indicating
that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
   (b)    If the transient is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.05 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator. The tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the Village, and the operator shall
be liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.06 REGISTRATION.
   On or before January 1,1979, or within thirty days after commencing
business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel or motel renting
lodging to transient guests shall register such hotel or motel with the
Director of Finance and obtain from him a Transient Occupancy Registration
Certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.
Such Certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)    The name of the operator;
   (b)    The address of the hotel or motel;
   (c)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (d)    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Hotel-
Motel Tax Ordinance by registering with the Director of Finance of the Village
of Richfield for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Hotel-
Motel Tax and remitting such tax to the Director of Finance. This certificate
does not constitute a permit." (Ord. 41-1979. Passed 5-1-79.)
193.07 RECORDS INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnished lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's record shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open,
during business hours for inspection by the Director of Finance, or his agents,
and shall be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by any order,
requesting that such records be kept for a longer period of time. (Ord. 59-
1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.08 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of February, 1979, and
on or before the last day of each month thereafter make and file a return for
the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Director of Finance, showing
the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the operator
to the Village for the period covered by the return, and such other information
as the Director deems necessary for the proper administration of this chapter.
   (b)    The Director of Finance may extend the time for making and filing
returns. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing the same to the
Director together with payment of the full amount of tax shown to be due
thereon.
   (c)    The Director of Finance may authorize operators whose tax liability
is not such to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Director upon the
basis of administrative costs of the Village, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (d)    All claims for exemptions from tax filed by transient guests with the
operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   (e)    All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated
as confidential by the Director of Finance and shall not be released by him
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent or the United States, State of Ohio, County of Summit or the Village of
Richfield, for official use only.
   (f)   If for any reason, the hotel or motel shall cease doing business in
the Village, all returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of
business.
   (g)    All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be
held in trust for the account of the Village of Richfield, until payment
thereof is made to the Director of Finance.
   (h)    The Director of Finance, if necessary in order to insure the payment
of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to be made
for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the operator or
authorized agent.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.09 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY DIRECTOR.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Finance shall proceed
in such manner as best to obtain facts and information on which to base the
estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director procures such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided by this
chapter. In case such determination is made, the Director shall give notice of
the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his last known place of business. Such operator may within ten days after the
serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Director
for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the Director, shall become final and
conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the
Director shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax,
interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be fixed.
After such hearing, the Director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted
and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed
herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and
penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days
unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
193.11.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.10 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF OFFICERS.
   If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the Village
under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make such filing
or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or supervision of
or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making payments, shall
be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation shall
not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for prior failure of the
operator to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due for such liability may
be collected by assessment in the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.11 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Director of Finance with
respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the Board of Review in accordance with Chapter
191.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.12 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the Village.
Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the Village
shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the Village. Any person owing
money to the Village under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an
action brought in the name of the Village for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.13 REFUNDS.
   (a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the Village under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing therefor, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Director of Finance within three years of the date of
payment. This claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director.
   (b)    Any operator may claim a refund or take as credit against tax
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Director of
Finance that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a
transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be
allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to
the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient
to the operator.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the Village by filing
of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when the
tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director of Finance, or
when the transient guest having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to
the satisfaction of the Director that the transient guest has been unable to
obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.14 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or
phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held
unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this chapter or any part thereof.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)
193.15 DELINQUENCY.
   (a)    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittances on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which
the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty
equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in
addition to the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed. An
additional penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the total tax and penalty of
the previous thirty day period shall be added for each successive thirty day
period that the account remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under the chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by the chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one-half percent (½%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of
the tax exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
(Ord. 59-1978. Passed 10-17-78.)

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.

entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.

combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three

physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

hereof, the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a
qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to
any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.

subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not

In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

recommendations of the physician, nurse or chiropractor as noted on the
affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor

or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure. (A.O.)

($100.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police
officer in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay
the current hourly rate for police officers providing traffic control services
as determined, from time-to-time, by the Chief of Police. The charge can be
prorated into fifteen minute increments.

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

cause every dog kept or harbored within the Village, except dogs confined to
registered kennels, to wear a valid tag on a collar attached to the dog issued

may be sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Public
Safety. Parts from which a vehicle identification number or derivative of it
has been removed, defaced, covered, altered or destroyed and that are not

manner that the court considers proper in the circumstances.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm

      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06 , or
545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of

duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

727.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses within the Village in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village. The provisions of this
chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication,
including sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose of
effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent of effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before
the Council and in studies of the Brookpark Road corridor conducted by the City
of Brook Park, Ohio; on findings incorporated in the cases of the City of
Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 91976); and on studies in other cities including New
York, New York; Islip, New York,; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with
Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of
Minnesota; this Council finds:
(1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities.
(2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
(3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage
such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
(4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy,
in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those
activities and maintain their facilities.
(5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the
areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
(6)   The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (5) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
(7)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
(8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the
burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually
oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the Village. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will further the
substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex-
related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public health,
safety, and welfare.
(10)   Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses and
requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the
substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual
activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
(11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will
advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in an sexually
oriented business or adult motel.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

final judicial decision within sixty (60) days of the date the appeal was
filed, the Village will issue such applicant a provisional sexually oriented
business license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of
the applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business license to
operate the sexually oriented business or adult motel named in the license
application under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business issued
pursuant to Section
727.07 of this chapter for the period of time specified in subsection (g)
hereof; and
      (2)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business employee
license to act as an employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business
or adult motel under the same terms as a normal sexually oriented business
employee license issued pursuant to Section
727.09 for the period of time specified in subsection (g) hereof; and

application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Zoning inspector pursuant to Section
727.12(b). The Zoning inspector shall grant an application for renewal of a
provisional license unless he determines that new grounds exist for denial of a
license application pursuant to Section

the event that an application for renewal of a provisional license is denied
and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial; the Village has the
right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial appeal of the
previous license denial.

motel, or similar commercial establishment has rented or subrented a sleeping

and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (k)   In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of
the user to immediately telephone and notify the Administrator of the incident.
The notification shall include location and discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume and corrective actions. Within five days following an
accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the Administrator a detailed
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater disposal system, fish kills or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by
this chapter or other applicable law.

   (a)   If any water or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged
to the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in Section
926.08 and, which in the judgment of the Administrator may have a deleterious
effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving
waters, including violation of applicable water quality standards, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Administrator may:
      (1)   Reject the waste;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treatment
of the wastes.
   (b)   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations
Part 128 unless the Village is committed, in its agreement with NEORSD, to
remove a specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances
the applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels
determined by the Administrator, or his duly authorized representative, or
State regulatory agencies.

926.10 CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (a)   Within ninety days after passage of this chapter, each person whose
operation entails the discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer shall
prepare and file with the Administrator a written statement setting forth the
nature of the operation contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and
source of water required for use, the proposed point of discharge of such
wastes into the wastewater collection system of the Village, the estimated
amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting forth expected
bacterial, physical, chemical and other known characteristics of such wastes.
Within a reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of
the Village to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the
judgment of the Administrator may be necessary to adequately guard against
unlawful uses of the Village's wastewater system.
   (b)   When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would
create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule
imposed herein, a request for extension of time may be presented for
consideration of the Administrator. All requests for extension of time shall be
submitted in writing stating the reasons for such a request. Under no
circumstances shall the extension of time exceed ninety days after approval of
the extension by the Administrator.
   (c)   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as

   Charges for waste treatment pursuant to Section
926.17 shall apply to wastes not exceeding normal concentrations as follows:
   (a)   For discharge to conventional gravity sanitary sewers:
      (1)   BOD - 210 milligrams per liter;
      (2)   Suspended Solids - 214 milligrams per liter;
   (b)   Applicable concentrations shall be based upon average concentrations,
weighted in proportion to volume of flow and determined during each billing
period by the most practical method possible. Should the average concentration
discharged to a Conventional Gravity Sanitary Sewer of any constituent exceed
the normal concentration provided in subsection (a) hereof, a surcharge for
each constituent so exceeded shall apply for the applicable billing period, in
accordance with the provisions of Section
926.18.

926.14 POLLUTANTS IN EXCESS OF NORMAL CONCENTRATIONS.
   (a)   Wastewater containing pollutants in excess of normal concentrations as
defined in Section
926.13(a) shall be:
      (1)   Subject to prohibition of discharge to the wastewater treatment
works; or
      (2)   Subject to pretreatment prior to discharge to the wastewater
treatment works to comply with concentrations or amounts of pollutants
established by the Village and subject to payment of a surcharge pursuant to
Section
926.18; or
      (3)   Permitted to be discharged to the wastewater treatment works
without pretreatment, subject to payment of a surcharge pursuant to Section
926.18.
   (b)   The Village shall determine which of the three alternates shall apply,
based upon the volume and concentration of pollutants of the wastewater
involved.
(Ord. 5-1991. Passed 1-17-91.)
926.15 VOLUME OF WASTEWATER.
   (a)    As described in subsequent sections of this chapter, certain segments
of the Sanitary Sewer Charges can be determined by applying a unit charge to a
volume of wastewater flow from each user. In all cases, this volume to be
charged for shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded
on the meters used to measure water from the water system within the Village,
unless the user is supplied with water from a source other than the water
system in the Village or unless a substantial volume of water supplied to the
user is not discharged to the wastewater treatment works, in which case, the
volume of water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be
determined by a meter installed to measure wastewater discharged, or by other
means approved by the Village. In the event a sewer user shall elect at his own
cost and expense to install a meter to register the exact volume of wastewater
that enters the wastewater treatment works, the volume to be charged for such
metered shall be based upon one hundred percent (100%) of the actual meter
reading and the rates established by the Village shall apply. Meters installed
other than the meter used to record consumption from the water system of the
Village shall be approved by the Village and installed and maintained at the
expense of the user. All commercial customers shall install a meter to monitor
either the water consumption or wastewater discharge as required by this
subsection. All residential properties shall be required to install a meter to
monitor either the water consumption or waste water discharge so as to provide
estimates for actual consumption for single family residential users throughout
the Village.
   (b)    Wastewater meters may be tested by the Village for accuracy at the
expense of the owner once a year.
   (c)    The Village shall have the authority to remove the meter on its
initiative to undertake the test and correct any meter which in its judgment is
registering incorrectly without the consent of the owner. Should the wastewater
meter be found to be registering outside of the accuracy of the specifications
published for such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for shipping, testing,
repair and replacement. Should the wastewater meter be found to be registering
within the accuracy of the specifications published for such meter, the Village
shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and replacement. During the
period the meter is not in service, the volume of wastewater discharged shall
be determined by the Administrator.
   (d)    Residential properties connected to the Village's sewerage system
without either a water consumption meter or a sewer discharge meter shall be
required to comply with subsection (a) of this section no later than December
31, 2024. Until such time that a compliant meter is installed under this
section, unmetered properties having no access to Village water and no
available water meter shall be charged according to the system and accompanying
tables shown in Exhibit B, which provide an estimate of anticipated flow for
unmetered users within the Village for the purpose of establishing a sanitary
sewer charge.
(Ord. 84-2023. Passed 11-21-23.)

discharges primarily segregated sanitary wastes or primarily wastes from
sanitary conveniences.
   (c)   Any industry, commercial/retail, or governmental/institutional/
religious establishment whose wastes are not primarily sanitary wastes or not
primarily wastes from sanitary conveniences shall be placed in the industrial
user class.
   (d)   The placement of a user within the resident user class shall be as
determined by the Administrator in accordance with the above criteria. (Ord.
17-2008. Passed 3-18-08.)
   (e)   Except as provided herein, no free service shall be permitted and no
user shall be excused from paying the above charges. A "homestead exemption" of
forty percent (40%) of the user charge being charged to customers pursuant to
Exhibit B of this Chapter shall be granted to users if a homestead exemption
has been applied for and granted by the Summit County Auditor for such
property. In order to be eligible for this "homestead exemption," the property
owner must furnish to the Director of Finance, on an annual basis, forms from
the Summit County Auditor verifying that the homestead exemption was granted
for the property.

EXHIBIT A
TAP-IN FEE REQUIREMENTS
A.   INTRODUCTION AND POLICY
A tap-in fee shall be charged to each property owner making a connection to the
Village's sanitary sewer system. The primary purpose of the tap-in fee shall be
to cover costs of inspection and other administrative fees that are borne by
the Village of Richfield. A permit to open or tap a sanitary sewer for
residential building shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). A permit to open
or tap a sanitary sewer for a commercial or industrial user shall be two
hundred dollars ($200.00).
Each tap-in fee shall be reviewed to assure that any previously applied
assessment costs present a true representation of the affected property. The
assessment policy shall be reviewed for the existing property at the time of a
tap-in fee consideration. Additional fees such as property expansion user fees
may also be charged to a connecting property at the time of connection. The
assessment policy and property expansion user fees shall be as defined below.
B.   ASSESSMENT POLICY
Properties within the Village which have been changed by consolidation or
property splits, or properties annexed to the Village which become part of an
existing property already served by the appropriate sewer district, shall be
subject to this assessment policy review and any additional costs shall be
included in a total tap-in fee.
Outlined below are the modifications with regard to any assessment and/or tap-
in fee procedure.
   1.   Property Modifications - Any existing properties which lie within the
Village and are modified through means of a split, consolidation or other
appropriate means shall be reviewed for compliance with the current assessment
policy in effect as of the time of certification of assessments to the County
Auditor for the appropriate sewer district.
      The assessment formula shall be applied to each of the modified property
(ies) to determine if any adjustment to the cost of the assessment is required.
The parameters to be investigated shall include: front footage, acreage,
zoning, land value and existing system utilization.
      Any increase in the adjusted assessment costs shall be paid to the
Village within sixty days of a certified notification to the property owner.
   2.   Annexed Properties - Any property that is annexed to the Village if
adjacent to a property currently in an existing sewer district, and which has
previously been assessed, shall be subject to this policy.
      For the purpose of this policy any sewer service provided these annexed
lands shall be provided after payment of an additional tap-in fee for those
areas not previously assessed.
      The additional fee shall be calculated in accordance with the current
assessment formula in effect as of the time of certification to the County
Auditor of the affected sewer district. The formula shall be applied to those
parameters of the formula applicable to the annexed area and shall include
front footage, acreage, zoning, land value and existing system utilization.
   3.   Formula - The formula shall be as finalized at the time of
certification to the County Auditor. It shall be reviewed annually and dollar
values adjusted each year to reflect construction cost modifications as
outlined in the Construction Cost Indices as provided by the Engineering News
Record.
C.   NEW SERVICE
The cost for a new service shall be completely borne by the property owner.
This service shall be installed by a licensed contractor, having secured all
permits as set forth by the Village. The design and construction shall be in
accordance with the design and construction standards of the Village.
A tap-in fee shall be applied for each connection. The tap-in fee and the
assessment cost shall be reduced by the amount of the actual cost of the
improvement to the owner from the central sewer to the owner's property line.
D.   PROPERTY EXPANSION USER FEES
In the event of a property undergoing significant change after assessment fees
had been determined, the Administrator may impose additional property expansion
user fees to reflect actual usage at the time of connection or improvement,
whichever occurs later. This property expansion user fee shall be applied to
any nonresidential building addition and any residential dwelling wherein
additional dwelling units are to be added. A schedule of these property
expansion user fees shall be determined by the Village and may change from time
to time. The fees in effect at the time of a submittal for expansion shall be
assessed to the affected property and included in the total tap-in fee.
   (Ord. 5-1991. Passed 1-17-91.)

included as Exhibit B-1. The assigned flows are totaled for each applicable
sewer district and the values assigned shall be calculated with the appropriate
value for the base unit - a single family residence. These values shall be
included with the metered values to determine the total revenue/flow volume
factors for the entire system. This data shall be utilized to prepare an annual
user charge.

1101.01 PURPOSE.
     Council finds, in the interest of promoting the public health, safety,
convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare, that it is necessary to
enact a Zoning Code for zoning within the limits of the Village of Richfield,
Summit County, Ohio, in order to regulate and promote the orderly development
of the community, to restrict the location of buildings and other structures
and of premises to be used for trade, industry, residence or other specified
uses, to regulate and limit the height of buildings and other structures
hereafter erected or altered, to regulate the bulk and location of buildings
and other structures hereafter erected or altered, to provide for the amount of
lot area which may be occupied, building setback lines and the area of yards,
courts or other open spaces and, for the combination of all of the purposes
hereinbefore described, to divide the Village into zoning districts as
hereinafter provided, which zoning districts are deemed and hereby determined
to be best suited to carry out the aforesaid purposes, all in accordance with
the Land Use and Thoroughfare Plan for Richfield Village.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1101.03 LONG TITLE.
     Titles One through Seven of this Part Eleven - the Planning and Zoning
Code, shall be known as "A Zoning Code to provide for dividing the incorporated
territory of Richfield Village into zoning districts for the purpose of
regulating the location, use, height, bulk, number of stories and size of
buildings and other structures, the amount of lot area which may be occupied,
building setback lines, size of yards, courts and other open spaces, and
density of population; to provide for a Board of Zoning Appeals; to authorize
conditional zoning certificates; and to provide for the administration and
enforcement of, and to provide penalties for violations of, the provisions of
this Zoning Code."
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1101.05 SHORT TITLE.
     Titles One through Seven of Part Eleven of these Codified Ordinances shall
be known as the "Zoning Code of the Village of Richfield, Ohio", or the "Zoning
Code."
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1101.07 INTERPRETATION.
        In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Zoning
Code, as most recently amended, shall be held to be the minimum requirements
for the promotion of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity, and general welfare.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1101.09 CONFLICTS.
       Whenever the regulations of this Zoning Code require a greater width or
size of yards or other open spaces, a lower height limit, a greater percentage
of lot to be left unoccupied, a lower density of population, or a more
restricted use of land, or impose other higher standards than are required in
any other ordinance or regulation, private deed restriction or private
covenant, these regulations shall govern. However, if the requirement of the
other ordinance, regulation, private deed restriction or private covenant is
the more restrictive, then such requirement shall govern.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1101.11 VALIDITY AND SEPARABILITY.
       If any section, subsection, or provision of this Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid or ineffective in whole or in part, or to be inapplicable to any person
or situation, the effect of such decision shall be limited to the provision
which is expressly stated in the decision to be invalid or ineffective, or to
the zoning lot, building or other structure or tract of land immediately
involved in the controversy. All other provisions of this Zoning Code or
amendments thereto, shall continue to be separate and fully effective, and the
application of any such provision to other persons or situations shall not be
affected.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1101.13 COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING REGULATIONS.
       All structures shall comply with the standards and requirements of the
Summit County Building Department regulations adopted and administered by the

herewith are hereby repealed.

appeals in Section
1107.05 (a) the Board shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the same
pursuant to Section
1107.05 (a)(2). The Board shall review each application for a variance to
determine if it complies with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and
evidence demonstrates that the literal enforcement of this Zoning Code will
result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, depending on the type
of variance sought.
         (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1107.09 REQUIRED FINDINGS FOR VARIANCE.
   (a)   When considering a request for a variance the Board shall be subject
to powers and limitations of powers set forth in Article X Section
10.02  of the Charter of the Village of Richfield and further subject to the
required findings set forth in Section
1107.09 (b) or Section
1107.09 (c) depending on the type of variance sought. The applicant for a
variance shall have the burden of proof in these proceedings.
   (b)    No variance to the provisions or requirements of the Zoning Code,
pertaining to area zoning requirements such as frontage, setback, and height
shall be granted by the Board unless the Board has determined that a practical
difficulty exists or will result from a literal enforcement of the Zoning Code.
The factors to be considered and weighed by the Board in determining whether a
property owner, seeking an area or setback variance, has proved practical
difficulty, include:
      (1)    Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to the lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
      (2)    Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)    Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structure;
      (4)    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment if the variance is granted;
      (5)    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer ,trash pickup;
      (6)    Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
       (7)    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
       (8)    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
         (9)    Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on
the applicant any special privilege that is denied by these regulations to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
         (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
          
   (c)   Subject to Article X, Section
10.02 of the Charter of the Village of Richfield, the Board may authorize a
variance, other than for area zoning requirements such as frontage, setback and
height, in specific cases, from the strict application of the Zoning Code,
provided that it has considered the conditions enumerated in (1) through (7)
below have been met:
      (1)   The variance requested stems from a condition, which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zoning district;
      (2)   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the applicant;
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent owners;
      (4)   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, or general welfare;
      (5)   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and intent
of the zoning code;
      (6)   The variance sought is the minimum which will afford relief to the
applicant; and
      (7)   There is no other economically viable use, which is permitted in
the zoning district. (Ord. 13-2019. Passed 7-2-19.)
1107.11 CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   The Board may further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems
necessary to ensure that the objectives of the regulations or provisions to
which the variance applies will be met.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1107.13 ACTION BY THE BOARD.
   The Board shall either approve, approve with supplementary conditions as
provided in Section
1107.11 , or disapprove the request for a variance according to the procedures
established for appeals in Section
1107.05 (a)(4). The Board shall further make a findings in writing that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that
will make possible a reasonable use of the land, building or structure. If a
variance has been denied by the Board, the Board need not reconsider the same
or substantially similar request for a variance if resubmitted within one year
after the date of the decision, unless the underlying conditions have
substantially changed.

Board's decision as approved in the meeting minutes. The Board shall issue such
findings and conclusions. Nothing herein shall extend the time for the filing
of an appeal pursuant to Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

   This Chapter regulates the continuance, maintenance, repair, restoring,
moving, and discontinuance of nonconforming buildings, land, and uses are
hereby established in order to achieve among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To permit the continuance of nonconformity but with control so as to
minimize any adverse effect on the adjoining properties and development;
   (b)   To regulate nonconforming building maintenance, repair and extension;
   (c)   To restrict the reconstruction of a nonconforming building if such
building is substantially destroyed;
   (d)   To require the permanent discontinuance of nonconforming buildings,
land and uses if the same are not operated for specified periods;
   (e)   To require conformity if nonconforming buildings, land and uses are
discontinued and to bring about eventual conformity in accordance with the
requirements of the Zoning Code of the Village; and
   (f)   To permit the expansion of nonconforming buildings provided the
expansion does not encroach any further into the required yard than what
currently exists.
      (Ord. 13-2019. Passed 7-2-19.)
1113.03 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   Nonconforming building means a building or other structure existing lawfully
at the time this Zoning Code or any subsequent amendment thereto became
effective, but which does not conform as to dimensions (area and width of lot,
width of yards, percent of land coverage, or height of building), or as to
design (designed or intended for a use not permitted or compatible with the
type of structure), or other regulations of the district in which it is
located. A nonconforming building may be continued as follows:
   (a)   Maintenance and Repair:  A building nonconforming as to dimensions
and/or design may be a continued use and normal repairs may be made. For the
purpose of this Zoning Code, normal repairs include the ordinary maintenance of
a building or structure, the replacement of equipment which is required for
safety of operation and the replacement or substitutions of machinery or
equipment. Normal repairs do not include the replacement of structural parts in
any building nonconforming as to design except when required by law to restore
the structure to a safe condition or to make the building or use conforming.
   (b)   Additions: A building nonconforming as to dimensions and/or required
yards may be added to or enlarged if the additions do not expand the
nonconformity any further, or encroach any further into the required yard, than
what currently exists.
   (c)   Moving: A building nonconforming as to dimension and/or design, may be
moved in whole or in part to any other location on the lot or to another lot if
every portion of such building so moved is made to conform to all current
regulations of the district in which it is to be located.
   (d)   Restoration of Damaged Building: If a nonconforming building is
damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of less than its assessed value
as shown in the current record of the County Auditor, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored but to not more than their former size,
provided such restoration is completed within a period of one year from the
date of damage or destruction. If such a building is occupied by a
nonconforming use prior to damage, such use may be reestablished.
If a building nonconforming as to dimension only is damaged or destroyed more
than its assessed value, it may only be restored or rebuilt in conformance with
all the yard, percent of coverage and height regulations of the district in
which it is located. If a building nonconforming as to design is damaged or
destroyed more than its assessed value, no repairing or reconstruction shall be
made unless every portion of the building is made to conform to all regulations
of the district in which the building is located and it shall be occupied only
by a conforming use. Determination of the value of the reproduction of that
which was destroyed shall be made by three practicing building construction
contractors, one to be appointed by the owner, one to be appointed by the
Zoning Inspector and the third to be selected by the mutual consent of the two
parties.
   (e)   Discontinuance of Use: If any nonconforming building or portion
thereof is not occupied by a use for a continuous period of at least one year,
the nonconforming building or nonconforming portion thereof shall be
reconstructed to comply with this Zoning Code and any further use must be in
conformity with the uses permitted in the district in which it is located.
      (Ord. 13-2019. Passed 7-2-19.)
1113.05 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS.
   "Nonconforming use of a building" means the use of a building existing
lawfully at the time this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto became
effective, but which does not conform to the use, advertising sign, parking, or
loading regulations of the district in which it is located. Any nonconforming
use of a building may be continued only under the following conditions:
   (a)   Change of Use: The nonconforming use of a building may only be changed
to a conforming use. Once a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming
use or a more restricted use, such use shall not be changed back to a less
restricted use or nonconforming use.
   (b)   Expansion of Use: The nonconforming use of part of a building may not
be expanded or extended.
   (c)    Abandonment of Use: If any nonconforming use within a building or
portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of at least one year,
any future use of such building or portion thereof so discontinued, shall
comply with this Zoning Code.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs: A nonconforming sign shall be regulated as set
forth in Chapter
1163 .
   (e)    Nonconforming Parking Facilities: A building or use existing lawfully
at the time this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto became effective, but
which does not conform with the off-street parking or off-street loading
regulations, may be occupied by the existing use without such parking and/or
loading facilities being provided. However, any parking spaces that may be
provided thereafter shall comply with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1177 . Furthermore, if the existing building is altered so that there is an
increase of the number of dwelling units, seating capacity or floor area, or if
the use is changed to a use requiring more off-street parking and loading
facilities, then off-street parking and loading facilities shall be made at
least equal to the number of spaces required for the entire building or use in
accordance with all provisions of Chapter
1177 .
   (f)   Nonconforming Use Performance Standards: Any use established before
the effective date of this Zoning Code and nonconforming as to one or more of
the performance standards established for industrial operations shall be
required to conform thereto within one year.
      (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1113.07 NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.
   "Nonconforming use of land" means any parcel of land nonconforming as to
use, existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Code or any amendment thereto
became effective but which does not conform with the use and/or dimension
regulations of the district in which it is located. Any nonconforming use of
land may be continued under the following conditions:
   (a)   Change of Use: The nonconforming use of land shall not be changed
except to any other use, which complies with this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Expansion of Use: The use of a lot or part thereof, nonconforming as
to use shall not be expanded or extended.
   (c)    Discontinuance of Use: If any lot or part thereof, nonconforming as
to use is discontinued for a continuous period of at least one year, any future
use of such lot or part thereof, shall comply with the use regulations of this
Zoning Code.

developed according to the following:
      (1)   If occupied by a building or use, such building or use may be
maintained, repaired or altered.
      (2)   If occupied by a building or use, such building or use may be
expanded, provided such addition complies with all other zoning regulations
except lot area and lot width.
      (3)   If vacant, the lot may be used for any use permitted in the zoning
district provided such use shall comply with building size and zoning use
requirements. Exceptions shall include lot area, lot width and setbacks, which
are regulated in item (b) below.
   (b)   Any lot not meeting minimum area requirements and being a lot of
record, a lot for which a land contract has been issued, or any lot within an
unrecorded allotment, of which at least one-half of such lots are of record or
have been sold on land contract on the effective date of this Zoning Code, may
be used irrespective of the area, depth or width of such lot. The width of the
side yard of any such lot need not exceed ten percent of the width of the lot;
the depth of the rear yard need not exceed 20% of the depth of the lot.
However, in no instance shall the minimum dimension of the side and rear yards
be less than five and 20 feet, respectively.

the grouping of open space and accessory facilities, such as garages or parking
spaces, flexibility in architectural design, including detached single-family
cluster dwellings on separate lots and attached single-family dwellings. The
area proposed shall be in one ownership, or if in several ownerships, the
application shall be filed jointly by all of the owners of the properties
included in the plan. In addition to the regulations outlined in Chapter
1130, the following conditions shall apply:

not less than 40%. For the purposes of this Section, "open space" means the
total of the areas of the development (whether in private, public, or common
ownership) which are maintained in their natural state or in lawns or other
vegetated landscaped areas and excluding the areas covered by buildings,
pavements, decks, pools, and similar structures and surfaces. Pavements
designed for passive recreation in public or common areas (e.g., trails,
pedestrian walkways, bikeways, areas around fountains and landscaped ponds) may
be included in open space.
         (6)    Off-street parking shall be provided as regulated by Chapter
1177.
         (7)    Developments regulated by this section shall conform to the
Subdivision Regulations applicable to residential districts.
      (8)   General Open Space Standards. Open space in a Planned Unit
Development shall be preserved, located, and arranged to comply with the
following standards as appropriate for the site, site conditions, and the
nature of its surrounds:
         a)   Areas of steep slopes, wetlands, watercourses, mature forests,
rock outcroppings or other notable features worthy of preservation are
appropriate for inclusion in designated open space;
         b)   Areas which may provide mitigation of impacts between proposed
and existing uses, particularly where a site abuts an existing single family
residential development or zoning district, are appropriate for designated open
space;
         c)   Where a proposed development will create building or lot
arrangements, such as housing clusters or a building with mass atypical in
residential areas, frontage along public roads may be appropriate as open space
in either its natural state or in a man-made landscape;
         d)   Professionally designed, installed, and maintained common open
space areas for passive recreation are encouraged in locations which are
physically and visually central to the development and accessible to all users
of the development.
         e)   Open space should be located where necessary to relieve the
visual and functional impacts of long rows of lot frontages and dwelling
facades, garages, and parking areas and to mitigate the impacts of clustering
in areas of traditional developments.
         f)   An area of land proposed as designated open space may not
completely fulfill the open space requirement even if it provides the minimum
area of land set forth in this Chapter. The amount and location(s) of open
space shall be selected and designed to address the open space standards
outlined above as appropriate for the specific development.

   (c)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Landscaping shall be used as a transition between uses, and to
screen areas from public view and to improve the appearance of developed areas.
All yard areas not used for accessory structures and uses shall be landscaped
and maintained with grass, trees, and shrubs.
      (2)   Plant materials should be chosen which are indigenous, moderately
fast growing, and require minimal maintenance. The landscape design should

(5)   Where landscaping is used as screening it shall be opaque year round.
      (6)   Landscape screening shall be of a height and density so that it
provides the full desired affect within three years growing time.
      (7)   Landscaping, walls, planters or similar means shall be used to
screen parked cars. Whenever structures such as walls or fences are used to
create a screen, plants shall be located on the sides of the structure which
can be seen from the surrounding streets, walks and other properties which are
used by the public. Landscape plans shall be approved by the Commission.
      (8)   All parking areas shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs and fences

unnecessary diffusion onto adjoining properties.
   (e)   Location, Orientation, Size and Shape of Buildings.
      (1)   No building shall exceed 5,000 square feet of gross floor area on
the ground floor. The 5,000 maximum square foot limitation set forth above
shall not be varied by the Planning Commission except upon a demonstration by
the applicant by clear and convincing evidence that a particular difficulty
exists as a result of the application of such standard and that the property
cannot be put to any viable economic use without the exception. The decision to
grant any exception to such 5,000 square foot limitation shall be forwarded by
the Planning Commission to Council for its review. Council shall have 30 days
from its receipt of the decision of the Planning Commission to confirm, deny,
or modify said decision. In the event Council does not act upon the decision of
the Planning Commission within said 30 days, the decision of the Planning
Commission shall be deemed to be confirmed.

   (h)   Building and Lot Aesthetics. The specific guidelines for building and
lot aesthetics in this subsection provide an illustration of the acceptable and
unacceptable methods of building design as it relates to height, scale,
massing, setback and other issues. For each specific guideline that follows, a
description of the recommended approach that the applicant/property owner
should "consider" is provided, with an illustration of the result of the
design. Similarly, a description is provided of the design approach that the
applicant/property owner should "avoid" when designing or remodeling structures
in these districts.
      (1)    Height:
Acceptable - Relating the overall height of new construction or renovation of
existing structures to that of adjacent structures.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3966_5715x1500.jpg]
Unacceptable - New construction that greatly varies in height (too high or too
low) from other buildings in the vicinity.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3995_4275x1980.jpg]
      (2)   Scale:
Acceptable - Relating the size and proportions of new structures to the scale
of adjacent buildings. Although much larger than its neighbors in terms of
square footage, the building shown maintains the same scale and rhythm as the
existing buildings.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4025_5670x1800.jpg]
Unacceptable - Buildings that in height, width or massing violate the existing
scale of the area. The new building shown here disrupts the scale and rhythm of
the streetscape.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4056_5625x2040.jpg]
      (3)   Massing:
Acceptable - Breaking up uninteresting boxlike forms into small, varied masses
such as are common on older buildings. Variety of form and massing are elements
essential to the character of the streetscape.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4088_5655x1815.jpg]
Unacceptable - Single, monolithic forms that are not relieved by variations in
massing. Boxlike facades and forms are intrusive when placed in a streetscape
of older buildings that have varied massing and facade articulation.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4121_5700x1830.jpg]
      (4)   Directional Expression:
Acceptable - Relating the vertical, or nondirectional facade character of new
buildings to the predominant directional expression of nearby buildings.
Horizontal buildings can be made to relate to the more vertical adjacent
structures by breaking the facade into smaller masses that conform to the
primary expression of the streetscape.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4155_5685x1275.jpg]
Unacceptable - Strongly horizontal or vertical facade expressions unless
compatible with the character of structures in the immediate area. The new
building shown does not relate well to either its neighbor or to the rhythm of
the streetscape because of its unbroken horizontal facade.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4192_5745x1200.jpg]
      (5)   Setback:
Acceptable - Maintaining the architectural facade lines of streetscape by
locating front walls of new building in the same plane as the facades of
adjacent buildings. If existing setbacks vary, new building should conform to
historic siting patterns.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4265_6465x1530.jpg]
Unacceptable - Violating the existing setback pattern by placing new buildings
in front of or behind the historic facade line. Avoid placing buildings at odd
angles to the street unless in an area where diverse siting already exists.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4303_5655x1530.jpg]
      (6)   Sense of Entry:
Acceptable - Articulating the main entrances to the building with covered
porches, porticos, and other pronounced architectural forms.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/dad6f0322c7ebfe25a4d3f746b2200aaefd91b06/
IMAGES/0-0-0-4342_5760x1140.jpg]
Unacceptable - Facades with no strong sense of entry. Side entries or entries
not defined by a porch or similar transitional element result in an
incompatible "flat" first floor facade.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4382_5640x1125.jpg]
(7)   Roof Shapes:
Acceptable - Relating the roof forms of the new building to those found in the
area. Although not entirely necessary, duplication of the existing or

(8)   Rhythm of Openings:
Acceptable - Respecting the recurrent alteration of wall area with door and
window elements in the facade. Also consider the width-to-height ratio of bays
in the façade. The placement of openings with respect to the facade's overall
composition symmetry, or balanced asymmetry, should be carefully studied.

Unacceptable - Introducing incompatible facade patterns that upset the rhythm
of the openings established in surrounding structures. Glass walls and window
and door shapes and their locations shown in example are incompatible to the
adjoining buildings.

1145.17 SITE DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   Site development plans and the review of same are required for all
development in the C-H Historic Commercial Districts in compliance with Chapter
1171 . The Commission shall have the authority to engage such architectural and
other professional consultants, as it deems necessary for the review of the

shall be added to the applicant's fee for the application for Site Development
Plan review as an escrow fund to be held by the Village from which to pay such

(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1145.19 DEMOLITION OR RELOCATION.
   (a)   In considering a request to demolish or move a building or other
structure located within the C-H Historic Commercial Districts, the Commission
shall consider the following factors in making its decision to approve or
disapprove the request:
      (1)   The architectural and historic significance of the subject building
or structure;
      (2)   The significance of the building or structure in contributing to
the architectural or historic character of its environs;
      (3)   The relationship between the location of the subject building or
structure and its overall significance (in the case of a request to move a
building or other structure);
      (4)   The present and potential viability of the subject building or
structure, given its physical condition and marketability;
      (5)   If the demolition will remedy conditions imminently dangerous to
the life, health or property, as determined in writing by the Director of
Public Safety, the Division of Fire or a department of Summit County; and
      (6)   The results of the review made pursuant to Section
1145.17 of the plans for the purposed re-use of the site, if any.
   (b)   The Commission may delay action for a period of not more than ninety
(90) days, on the demolition or moving of a building which it deems to be
significant, in order to allow economic viability studies to be conducted, as
well as to allow interested parties the opportunity to explore alternatives to
the proposed action. At the end of such ninety (90) day period, or such longer
period as Council may have authorized, the Commission shall either approve or
disapprove the request to demolish or move. A disapproval of the request to
demolish or move must be based upon written findings of fact approved by the
Commission and related to each of the factors in subsection (a) above and must
be filed with the Clerk of Council immediately. Council may, within thirty days
after such filing, reverse or modify the decision of the Commission by a
resolution of Council receiving the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the
members elected or appointed to Council, which shall be a final order for
purposes of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506. If no action is taken by Council within
such thirty day period, then the decision of the Commission shall be a final
order for purposes of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.

Commission has the authority to adjust lot sizes for certain permitted and
conditionally permitted uses if an applicant demonstrates that four acres are
not necessary based on the size and use of the building proposed. Industry
standards may be considered to demonstrate necessary parcel sizes. Imaginative
building and site design can also be used to vary parcel sizes. In no such case

Further, it is not the intent of this chapter to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
   (b)    Findings. The Council has received substantial evidence concerning
the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes

      (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1169.17 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)    The SWP3 must contain a description and location of all appropriate
BMPs for each construction operation. Prior to the start of grading and within
seven days from the start of grubbing, the applicant must implement such
controls. The SWP3 must clearly describe for each major construction activity
the appropriate control measures; the general sequence during the construction
process under which the measures will be implemented; and the person(s)
responsible for implementation. The time frame for SWP3 implementation shall be
consistent with the current Ohio EPA NPDES Construction permit. No project
subject to this Chapter shall commence without a SWP3 or approved by the Summit
SWCD. No project subject to this Chapter shall commence without a pre-
construction meeting being held with the Summit SWCD. It will be the
applicant's responsibility to contact the SWCD.
   (b)   The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors not
otherwise defined as "operators" as defined in the Ohio EPA's NPDES Permit, who
will be involved in the implementation of the SWP3 of the terms and conditions
of the SWP3. The applicant shall maintain a written document containing the
signatures of all contractors and subcontractors involved in the implementation
of the SWP3 as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and understand the
conditions and responsibilities of the SWP3. The written document shall be
created and signatures shall be obtained prior to commencement of work on the
construction site. A copy shall be provided to the Summit SWCD prior to
commencing with the project.
   (c)    All projects regardless of the area of disturbance must utilize BMP's
to minimize erosion and off site sedimentation. The controls shall include the
following minimum components:
      (1)    During active construction:
         A.    Non-structural preservation measures: The applicant must make
use of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas,
preserving existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at
any one time, and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective
clearing or grubbing practices.
            1.    Stream protection: The requirements of Chapter
1179 Riparian Setbacks of the Codified Ordinances of the Village shall be
followed.
            2.    Wetland Protection: The setback requirements of the Village
Subdivision Regulations shall be followed in addition to state and federal
regulations.
         B.   Erosion control practices: The applicant must make use of erosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over 70% of disturbed soils. A
description of control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after
grading or construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
         C.   Runoff control practices: The applicant must make use of measures
that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, and diversions
to direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
         D.   Sediment control practices: The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than s even days. Such practices may include,
among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment-settling pond.
         E.   Non-sediment pollutant controls: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in
storm water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices
to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
         F.   Compliance with other requirements: The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
         G.   Trench and ground water control: There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
         H.   Applicant Inspections: An initial inspection of all erosion and
sediment control practices shall be conducted by a qualified individual to
certify that the installations comply with the approved SWP3. All controls on
the site shall be inspected by the applicant's agent at least once every seven-
calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half
inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall assign a qualified
individual to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices
are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether
additional control measures are required. Internal inspections and
documentation of corrective actions taken must be made available upon request.
         I.   Maintenance: The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Summit SWCD.
            1.   When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
                i.   When practices require repair or maintenance: If an
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be
repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection.
               ii.   When practices fail to provide their intended function: If
an inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
               iii.   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If
an inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
         J.   Final stabilization: All soil disturbing activities are complete
and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70% coverage for the
area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures. In addition, all temporary erosion and sediment control
practices have been removed and disposed of in an acceptable manner.
      (2)    Post construction water quality practices.
         A.   Non-structural water quality practices: Non-structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
              1.    All non-structural water quality practices must be
protected from disturbance through the construction phase of the project.
              2.    All non-structural water quality practices must be
protected in perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All
easement or conservation areas must appear on the final plat and be disclosed
to potential buyers.
         B.   Structural water quality practices: Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration.
            1.   All structural water quality practices must be established
prior to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices
should be made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If
detention/retention facilities were used for sediment control during
development sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post
construction storm water quality.
            2.    Maintenance: The post construction water quality practice
must be maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the SWP3 or the
Storm Water Management Maintenance Agreement. The Village shall not be
responsible for the maintenance of post-construction water quality practices
unless explicitly stated in the Storm Water Management Maintenance Agreement.
If necessary, the Village may perform maintenance work and assess the
responsible parties for the cost of the work.

1171.11 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Review by Staff and Consultants. The application shall be referred to
Village Departments and to the Village Engineer and other Village consultants
for review and comment.
   (b)   Review by Commission.  The Commission shall review the complete
application package as transmitted by the Zoning Inspector in terms of the
standards established in this Zoning Code. If deemed necessary, the Commission
or Zoning Inspector, with notice to the applicant, may refer an application to
other qualified consultants for review. All costs associated with outside
consultant reviews shall be at the sole expense of the applicant. Zoning
certificates will not be issued by the Zoning Inspector until all such costs
are paid in full to the Village.
   (c)   Building and Site Design Standards.  In addition to all other
applicable standards in this Code, and the Village's Technical Design
Standards, applicants are required to meet these minimum thresholds and are
encouraged to exceed them as the design evolves. The Zoning Inspector and
Commission shall be guided by the following standards in reviewing each
application for a zoning certificate:
      (1)   Materials shall be appropriate for the use of the building, for
weathering and for relationship to other materials including those used on
adjacent buildings. Unless specifically approved by the Planning Commission on
an individual basis (such as in a "high style" contemporary/modern design),
exterior finish materials shall not terminate at outside corners and shall be
of consistent character and level of finish at all building elevations.
Surrounding context will also be taken into consideration by the Zoning
Inspector and Commission on a case-by-case basis.
      (2)   Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, non-
residential buildings shall be clad in masonry materials. Four-inch split-faced
block is acceptable, with eight-inch split-faced block only permissible on side
or rear building elevations (unless facing a street).
      (3)   Colors and textures shall be appropriate for the size and scale of
the building, for weathering, and for relationship to the site and adjacent
buildings. The use of a single color on homes in a subdivision is not
permitted.
      (4)   Architectural details and ornaments shall be meaningful to the
overall design, and appropriate for the size and scale of the buildings, and
for weathering. Architectural details, ornaments, finishes, fenestration
quality (and quantity where feasible and practical), design intent of massing/
scale/depth/shadow shall be of consistent character, intent, and appearance for
all sides of the building, whether or not visible from a dedicated roadway. The
articulation of facades and the attentive massing of structures give them
relief, richness, visual interest, and scale and are required. Long,
uninterrupted exterior walls devoid of detail, fenestration, and articulation
should be avoided. The use of augmented levels of fenestration at principal
facades is encouraged.
      (5)   Accessory buildings shall be compatible in design and materials as
the main structure. The ground floor area of an accessory building cannot
exceed 75% of the area of the ground floor area of the principal structure. In
no case shall the total area of an accessory structure exceed the area of the
principal structure. Accessory buildings cannot be located or constructed on a
property without a principal structure.
      (6)   Mechanical equipment shall be considered as it affects rooftop
appearance, sidewall openings, sound levels, smoke and other nuisance aspects;
and as it related to overhead wires, gas and electric meter stations and any
other visible appurtenances. Rooftop-mounted mechanical equipment shall be set
back from building edges. Where visible from viewpoint origins as determined by
Zoning Inspector and/or Commission, mechanical equipment shall be screened from
view. Mechanical equipment screens shall be compatible in design and materials
to the main structure.
      (7)   Approaches, drives and parking areas shall be considered as they
affect the appearance from the street and from the site, as well. The
relationship of paving to the building shall be appropriate considering factors
such as safety, drainage and landscaping.
      (8)   All non-residential drives and parking areas shall be paved with
concrete or bituminous concrete or other hard surfaced materials. Chip and seal
is not permitted for non-residential drives and parking areas. Drives and
parking areas can be constructed using permeable materials such as brick
pavers, concrete and asphalt.
      (9)   Landscaping shall be appropriate for the size and use of the area,
and for its relationship to building, street, parking area, walks and adjacent
buildings. Yards shall be landscaped and maintained with grass, trees, and
shrubs. In non-residential zoning districts parking in front of a building
shall be appropriately screened with shrubs, trees or landscaped earthen
mounds.
      (10)   Security fences, i.e. chain-link fencing shall not be permitted in
the O/LI or I Districts in front of any building or other side yard setbacks of
a corner lot. Security fences shall be appropriately screened with trees and
shrubs from a public street. Security fences (other than agricultural
containment fences) are not permitted to be electrified by any means.
      (11)   All trash containers and trash storage areas shall be screened
with a six-foot high masonry enclosure on three sides and a board-on-board gate
on the front. In the Industrial District, all outside storage areas shall be
enclosed and screened from the view of adjacent properties.
      (12)   Lighting shall be considered for the appropriateness of nighttime
illumination of the grounds, drives, walks, parking areas, the building and its
affect upon surrounding areas. Lighting shall conform with the standards set
forth by the International Dark-Sky Association (or reasonable equivalents).
      (13)   Signs shall be considered for appropriateness of size, scale,
shape, color and illumination in relation to building and site.
      (14)   Buildings adjacent to Interstate highways shall be designed and
landscaped to be visually attractive as seen from the highways.
      (15)   The application shall comply with all relevant land planning and
zoning regulations, standards and criteria.
      (16)   The development shall be coordinated and integrated with the
surrounding natural and man-made features.
      (17)   The development shall be coordinated and integrated with the
surrounding development considering both site development and architecture. The
developer shall be required to conform to any local plans for the area
established by the Commission.
         (Ord. 13-2019. Passed 7-2-19.)
   (d)    Modifications Permitted in Residential Districts. Where application
of a provision in the code would result in a development that, in the opinion
of the Commission, would not be satisfactory for the zoning district the
Commission may require adjustments in the development plan (such as improvement
to the design and arrangement of buildings, yards, on-site circulation, access
drives, and such other features as fences, planting or other landscape feature)
to further improve the proposed development and to protect the surrounding
developments.
   (e)    Modifications Permitted in Commercial and Industrial Districts. The
Commission may make adjustments to certain yard requirements in order to attain
greater openness and other amenities by skillful design in the arrangement of
buildings, the layout of drives, on-site circulation and parking areas and the
design of landscaping or other site features provided:
      (1)   The total yard area of the lot shall be not less than required
under the zoning district regulations;
      (2)   The maximum percent of the lot occupied by buildings shall not be
in excess of that permitted in the zoning district;
      (3)   The required percent of lot to be landscaped shall not be reduced;
      (4)   Front yards of buildings may be reduced by not more than 50% of the
required distance;
      (5)   Side or rear yards of a one or two story building may be reduced by
not more than 50% of the required distance but not less than 15 feet only when
adjacent to non-residential districts;
      (6)   Front yards of parking areas may be reduced by not more than 50% of
the required distance but not less than 25 feet;
      (7)   Side or rear yards of parking areas may be reduced to five feet
only when adjacent to non-residential districts. Elimination of side or rear
yards may be permitted when adjoining an existing or planned parking area in a
non-residential district.
   (f)   Action by Commission. The Commission shall take action on the
preliminary development plan within 45 days from the date of the Commission
meeting at which all required plans and data were received. The Commission may
approve the preliminary development plan as submitted, table the plan as
submitted, approve the preliminary development plan as modified and agreed to
by the applicant, or not approve the preliminary development plan as submitted.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1171.13 FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS.

1173.05 BASIS OF DETERMINATION.
   There may be imposed such additional conditions and safeguards as are deemed
necessary for the general welfare, for the protection of individual property
rights, and for insuring that the intent and objectives of this zoning will be
observed. The Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of
each proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall be convinced
that such use on the proposed location:
   (a)    Will be consistent with the general objectives or with any specific
objective of the Land Use and Thoroughfare Plan of current adoption;
   (b)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
compatible and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity, and will not change the essential character
of the same area;
   (c)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
   (d)   Will not be detrimental to property in the immediate vicinity or to
the community as a whole;

Summit County General Health District and the Summit County Building Code; and
   (g)    Will have vehicular approaches to the property, which shall be so
designed as not to create, and interfere with traffic on surrounding public
streets or roads.
      (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1173.07 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Review by Staff and Consultants. The application shall be referred to
Village Departments and to the Village Engineer and other Village consultants
for review and comment.
   (b)    Review by Commission. The Commission shall review the complete
application package as transmitted by the Zoning Inspector in terms of the
standards established in this Zoning Code. If deemed necessary, the Commission,
with the consent of the applicant, may refer an application to qualified
consultants for review. The cost of such review shall be at the expense of the
applicant. The Zoning Inspector shall notify owners of properties within 500
feet, or a larger area if the Zoning Inspector deems it appropriate, of the
perimeter of the property proposed for development not less than ten days prior
to the meeting at which the application will be considered by the Commission.
   (c)    Action by Commission. The Commission shall take action on the

Commission reviews and grants either preliminary or final approval of an
application for approval of a conditional use or whenever the Board grants
either preliminary or final approval of an application for approval of a
conditional use upon appeals from a decision of the Commission, such approval
shall not become effective for a period of 30 days after the meeting at which
the Commission or Board approved the motion for preliminary or final approval
of a conditional use. Within said 30-day period, Council, either by letter
filed with the Clerk of Council signed by four members of Council or by the
affirmative vote of four members of Council, may call up the issue of the
approval of the conditional use. Council may at any time during said 30-day
period waive its right to exercise such call up authority. Upon Council
exercising its call up authority, the action of the Commission or Board in
granting preliminary or final approval of the conditional use shall not become
effective and Council may review the approval of the conditional use using the
same standards as are contained in the Zoning Code governing the Commission's
consideration of applications for approval of conditional uses. The Council
shall not be bound by any time limit in its deliberations. In any such case in
which Council exercises its authority to call up the application for approval
of a conditional use under this section, the determination of Council shall
have final approval authority over the consideration of application for
approval of a conditional use.

1175.05   Commercial and Industrial Districts.
1175.07   Other districts.
1175.09   Conditional nature of use and requirements for permits.
1175.11   General requirements,
1175.13   Permit fees or deposits.
1175.01 PURPOSE.
   The Wireless Telecommunication Facility Chapter accommodates transmitters,
towers and antennas, for use in providing personal wireless services in a
variety of zoned districts, contingent upon having met specified requirements,
conditions and design criteria. This chapter will help minimize the visual
impact of the towers and associated facilities through landscape buffering,
selective design and construction, setbacks for location and the removal of
such facilities when no longer in use. This chapter encourages co-location of
installations on common towers whenever feasible, minimizing the need for
additional towers. This process is directed at maintaining a balance between
the Village's right to preserve its land use policies for health, safety,
welfare and aesthetics, while allowing the federal government to provide for
and spur competition in the telecommunication industry.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)

         (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1175.09 CONDITIONAL NATURE OF USE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITS.
   A wireless telecommunication facility is subject to the provisions of the
appropriate chapter governing conditional zoning certificates for the zoning
district in which it is to be located and is subject to all requirements of
this chapter, including the following items to be considered for review, upon
application for a permit:
   (a)   All towers shall be of a monopole design, as opposed to a lattice or
guy wire design.
   (b)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the telecommunication tower must
be located where it is proposed in order to service the applicant's service
area. There shall be in writing an explanation of why a tower and this proposed
site is technically necessary and that the wireless telecommunication antenna
(s) reasonably serves the purpose for which it is intended within the band
width of frequencies for which the owner or operator of the antenna(s) has been
licensed by the FCC to operate without a significant loss of communication
capability within developed areas of the Village.
   (c)   When a tower is modified or additional equipment is to be located on
an existing tower, the applicant shall provide written documentation from an
Ohio registered Engineer that the existing structure is capable of holding the
modified or additional equipment and that the tower is structurally sound.
   (d)   All applicants for construction of wireless telecommunication towers
shall be required to construct on a base tower structure and structure
foundation that is designed to be buildable up to, but not including, 200 feet
above the finished grade. Such structure shall be designed to have sufficient
structural loading capacity to accommodate at least three antenna platforms of
equal loading capacity for three separate providers of service to be located on
the structure when constructed to the maximum allowable height. The wireless
telecommunication facility shall also be designed to show that the applicant
has enough space on its site plan for an equipment shelter large enough to
accommodate at least three users of the facility. If an equipment shelter is
initially constructed to accommodate only one user, space shall be reserved on
site for equipment shelter expansions to accommodate up to at least three
users. Agreement to this provision must be included in the applicant's lease
with the landowner, if different from the owner/operator of the tower. Written
documentation must be presented to the Zoning Inspector evidencing that the
landowner of the property on which the tower is to be located has agreed to the
terms of this section. As an additional condition of issuing a zoning
certificate, the owner/operator/applicant agrees to respond to any inquiries
regarding co-location within 30 days after receipt of a written inquiry.
In all circumstances, owners of existing towers shall promptly respond in
writing to requests for collection, but in no event shall they respond more
than 30 days from the date of receipt of a written request for collocation.
Copies of all written requests to collocate and all written responses shall be
sent to the Zoning Inspector.
   (e)   The applicant requesting permission to install a new tower shall
provide evidence there is no technically suitable space for the applicant's
antenna(s) and related facilities reasonably available on an existing tower
within the geographic area to be served. With the zoning certificate
application, the applicant shall list the location of every tower, building or
structure that could support the proposed antenna(s) or area where it would be
technically suitable to locate so as to allow it to serve its intended
function. The applicant must demonstrate that a technically suitable location
is not reasonably available on an existing tower. If another existing tower is
technically suitable, the applicant must demonstrate that it has made written
request to co-locate on the existing tower and the co-location request was
rejected by the owner of the tower. In all circumstances, owners of existing
towers shall promptly respond in writing to requests for collocation, but in no
event shall they respond more than thirty days from the date of receipt of a
written request for co-location. If another telecommunication tower is
technically suitable, the applicant must further show that it has offered to
allow the owner of that other tower to collocate an antenna(s) on another tower
within the Village which is owned or controlled by the applicant, if available,
on commercially reasonable terms and the offer was not accepted. In all cases,
the Village shall use its best efforts to encourage co-location.
   (f)   Where the telecommunication facility is located on a property with
another principal use, the applicant shall present documentation that the owner
of the property has granted an easement or entered into a lease for the
proposed facility and that the vehicular access is provided to the facility.
   (g)   The wireless telecommunication facility shall be fully automated and

the entire site and shall indicate how the wireless telecommunication facility
will be screened from adjoining uses.
   (l)   A buffer area of not less than ten feet in depth shall be placed
between the wireless telecommunications facility and the public rights of way,
and any property lines. The ten foot buffer area shall consist of rows of
evergreen trees planted five feet on center with a maximum height of six feet
or other plantings as deemed appropriate by the Commission. The landscaping
shall be continuously maintained and promptly restored, if necessary.
   (m)   Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible.

1179.01 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)    It is hereby determined that the system of streams and other
watercourses within the Village contributes to the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the Village. The specific purpose and intent of
these regulations is to regulate uses and developments within riparian setbacks
that would impair the ability of riparian areas to:
      (1)    Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters and regulating base flow.
      (2)    Stabilize the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)    Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.

(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.03 CONFLICTS WITH OTHER REGULATIONS & SEVERABILITY.
   (a)    Where these regulations impose a greater restriction upon land than
is imposed or required by any other provision of law, regulation, contract or
deed, the provisions of these regulations shall control.
   (b)    These regulations shall not limit or restrict the application of
other provisions of law, regulation, contract or deed, or the legal remedies
available thereunder, except as provided in (a) of this section.
   
   (c)    If any clause, section or provision of these regulations is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.05 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    For the purpose of these regulations, the following terms shall have
the meaning herein indicated:
           (1)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) means conservation practices
or protection measures which reduce the impacts from a particular land use.
Best Management Practices for construction are outlined in "Rainwater and Land
Development, Ohio's Standard for Stormwater Management, Land Development, and
Urban Stream Protection" prepared by the :Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
         (2)    Damaged or Diseased Trees: Trees that have split trunks, broken
tops, heart rot; insect or fungus problems that will lead to imminent death,
undercut root systems that put the tree in imminent danger of falling or lean
as a result of root failure that puts the tree in imminent danger of falling;
or any other condition that puts the tree in imminent danger of being uprooted
or falling into or along a watercourse or onto a structure.
           (3)    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) means the agency
with overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
           (4)    Impervious Cover means any surface that cannot effectively
absorb or infiltrate water. Impervious surfaces may include roads, streets,
parking lots, rooftops, sidewalks and other areas not covered by vegetation.
      (5)    Natural Succession means gradual and continuous replacement of one
kind of plant and animal group by a more complex group. The plants and animals
present in the initial group modify the environment through their life
activities thereby making it unfavorable for themselves. They are gradually
replaced by a different group of plants and animals better adapted to the new
environment.
      (6)    Noxious Weed means any plant species defined by the Ohio
Department of Agriculture as a "noxious weed" and listed as such by the
Department. For the purposes of these regulations, the most recent version of
this list at the time of application of these regulations shall prevail.
      (7)    Ordinary High Water Mark means the point of the bank or shore to
which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a
district marked by erosion, destruction or prevention of woody terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristic. The ordinary high water mark defines the bed of a watercourse.
      (8)    Perennial Stream means a natural watercourse that contains water
throughout the year except possibly during periods of extreme drought.
      (9)    Pollution means any contamination or alteration of the physical,
chemical or biological properties of any waters that will render the waters
harmful or detrimental to: public health, safety or welfare; domestic,
commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational or other legitimate
beneficial uses; livestock, wildlife, including birds, fish or other aquatic
life.
         A.    "Point Source" pollution is traceable to a discrete point or
pipe.
                  B.    "Non-Point Source" pollution is generated by various
land use activities rather than from an identifiable or discrete source, and is
conveyed to waterways through natural processes, such as rainfall, storm runoff
or ground water seepage rather than direct.
        (10)    Practical Difficulties means in determining whether a property
owner has encountered "practical difficulties" in meeting the requirements set
forth in this Chapter, the following factors are to be considered and weighed:
                 A.    Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable
return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance or modification;
         B.    Whether the variance or modification is substantial;
         C.    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered, or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance or modification;
         D.    Whether the variance or modification would adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services;
         E.    Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the restrictions contained in this Chapter;
         F.    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance; and,
         G.    Whether the spirit and intent behind this Chapter's requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance or
modification.
       (11)    Riparian Area means naturally vegetated land adjacent to
watercourses that, if appropriately sized, stabilizes stream banks, limits
erosion, reduces flood size flows and/or filters and settles out runoff
pollutants, or performs other functions consistent with the purposes of these
regulations.
       (12)    Riparian Setback means those lands within the Village that fall
within the area defined by the criteria set forth in these regulations. The
setback shall be the perpendicular (shortest) distance between any point along
the ordinary high water mark and the setback line.
      (13)    Riparian Setback Map means a current edition of a map, developed
using the Summit County Geographic Information System and other information,
identifying watercourses and their riparian setbacks within the Village of
Richfield. Riparian Setbacks shall be determined using the Riparian Setback
Map. Riparian Areas and watercourses shall not be limited to those shown on the
Riparian Setback Map.
      (14)    Soil Disturbing Activity means the clearing, grading, excavating,
filling or other alteration of the earth's surface where natural or human made
ground cover is destroyed and which may result in, or contribute to, erosion
and sediment pollution.
      (15)    Stormwater Quality Treatment means the removal of pollutants from
urban runoff and improvement of water quality accomplished largely by
deposition and utilizing the benefits of natural processes and Best Management
Practices.
      (16)    Watercourse means any natural, perennial or intermittent stream,
river or brook, or one that has been altered by unnatural processes, with a
defined bed and bank that is contained, within, flows through or borders the
Village.
      (17)    Watershed means an area of land that drains into a particular
watercourse, usually divided by topography.
         (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.07 ESTABLISHMENT OF RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)    Riparian setbacks are established as follows:
      (1)    A minimum distance on either side of the watercourse as shown on
the Riparian Setback Map.
       (2)    Riparian Areas, watercourses and setbacks shall not be limited to
those shown on the Riparian Setback Map. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall determine the setbacks for any watercourses not shown on the Riparian
Setback Map.
       (3)    Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream or watercourse, the following adjustment for
steep slopes will be integrated into the riparian setback distance shown on the
Riparian Setback Map:
 
Average Percent Slope Width of Adjustment
15% - 20%             Add 25 feet
21% - 25%             Add 50 feet
> 25%                 Add 100 feet
   (b)    The following conditions shall apply in riparian setbacks:
       (1)    Riparian setbacks shall be measured in a horizontal direction
outward from the ordinary high water mark of each watercourse.
       (2)    Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, riparian
setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state.
   (c)    The developer, applicant or designated representative shall be
responsible for delineating riparian setbacks and identifying those setbacks on
all subdivisions, land development plans and/or building permit applications
submitted to the Zoning Inspector. This delineation shall be done at the time
of application of the preliminary plan or at the time of submission of any
permit applications. This delineation shall be done through a metes and bounds
survey and shall be subject to review and approval by the Zoning Inspector. As
the result of this review, the Commission may require further studies from the
developer, applicant or designated representative.
   (d)    Prior to any soil disturbing activity, riparian setbacks shall be
clearly delineated by the landowner on site, and such delineation shall be
maintained throughout soil disturbing activities.
   (e)    No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector prior
to delineation of riparian setbacks in conformance with these regulations.
    (f)    Upon completion of an approved subdivision, land development or
other improvement, riparian setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat
records for the Village. A plat, showing property lines, riparian area,
setbacks, existing improvements, proposed improvements and watercourse(s),
shall be submitted for all proposed improvements. The plat shall be a scaled
drawing prepared by a registered surveyor and shall contain enough information
(bearings, distances, dimensions, etc.) so that the riparian setback can be
definitely located and defined relative to the property lines, improvements and
watercourse(s).
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.09 USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.

of non-damaged or non-diseased trees is prohibited when constructing Private
Recreational and Maintenance Access Paths.
   (b)    By Right Uses with a Permit.
      (1)   Streambank Stabilization/Erosion Control Measures. Streambank
stabilization/erosion control measures may be allowed provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical and available. Such
streambank stabilization/erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon
approval of an Erosion Control Plan by the Zoning Inspector. In reviewing this
plan, the Zoning Inspector may consult with a representative of the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas and Preserves; Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; Summit County Soil
and Water conservation District; or other technical experts as necessary.
      (2)    Crossings. Crossings of designated watercourses through riparian
setbacks by publicly owned sewer and/or water lines and public utility
transmission lines may only be allowed upon approval of a Crossing Plan by the
Zoning Inspector. Such crossings shall minimize disturbance to riparian areas
and shall mitigate any necessary disturbances. In reviewing this plan, the
Zoning Inspector may consult with a representative of the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, Division of Natural Areas and Preserves; Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; Summit County Soil and Water
Conservation District; or other related technical experts as necessary.
      (3)    Cultivation. The cultivation of lawns, landscaping, shrubbery or

cultivation activities in the riparian setback.
   (f)    New Surface and/or Subsurface Sewage Disposal or Treatment Areas.
Riparian areas shall not be used for the disposal or treatment of sewage except
in accordance with Summit County District Board of Health regulations at the
time of application of these regulations.
      (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.13 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES IN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   Nonconforming structures or uses in riparian setbacks shall be regulated
under the provisions of Chapter
1113 of the Zoning Code. Where the following language is more restrictive or
conflicts with Chapter
1113 of the Zoning Code, the following language shall prevail:
   (a)    A nonconforming use, existing at the time of passage of these
regulations and within a riparian setback, that is not permitted under these
regulations may be continued but shall not be changed or enlarged unless
changed to a use permitted under these regulations.
     (b)    A nonconforming residential or commercial structure that exists at
the time of passage of these regulations, is within a riparian setback, and is
not permitted under these regulations may be continued, or may be removed or
replaced, changed, expanded or enlarged providing: Any such proposed structure
is setback no less than the distance between the ordinary high water mark and
the foundation of the existing residential or commercial structure.
        (c)    A nonconforming accessory structure, existing at the time of
passage of these regulations and within a riparian setback, that is not
permitted under these regulations, may be continued or replaced but shall not
have the existing building footprint or roofline expanded or enlarged.
        (d)    A nonconforming structure or use, existing at the time of
passage of these regulations and within a riparian setback, that has
substantial damage and which is discontinued, terminated or abandoned for a
period of two years or more may not be revived, restored or re-established.
      (Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.15 MODIFICATION TO RIPARIAN SETBACKS AND BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION.
   (a)    The Commission may modify these regulations provided herein, and
other setback and yard requirements in this Zoning Code, in cases where
practical difficulties in the use of the property are imposed by the
regulations and the need for requested relief outweighs the potential harm or
reduction in riparian area functions which may be caused by a proposed use.
   (b)    In making a determination under (a), the Commission may consider, in
addition to practical difficulties, the following factors:
      (1)    The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the riparian area.
      (2)    The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, and other functions of the
riparian area. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)    The degree of difficulty these regulations place on the landowner
and the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)    Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent possible and to
include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion and control
sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover in the riparian
setback compromises its benefits to the Village. Variances should not be
granted for asphalt or concrete paving within the riparian setback unless
permitted by Sections
1179.09(a)(4);
1179.09(b)(5) and
1179.09(b)(6). Variances may be granted for gravel driveways.
      (6)    That no lot, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
Village, shall be made 6unbuildable because of the riparian setback
requirements, with special emphasis on lots of one acre or less trying to find
the optimum location for a structure or other improvements on the lot.
   (c)    When a landowner or applicant disputes the boundary of a riparian
setback or the ordinary high water mark of a watercourse, the landowner or
applicant shall submit evidence to the Zoning Inspector that describes the
boundary, the landowner or applicant's proposed boundary, and justification for
the proposed boundary change.
   (d)    The Zoning Inspector shall evaluate materials submitted and shall
make a written recommendation within a reasonable period of time not to exceed
60 days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the landowner or applicant. If
during this evaluation the Zoning Inspector requires further information, he or
she may require this to be provided by the landowner or applicant.
     
   (e)    Any party aggrieved by any such determination or requesting a
modification to these regulations may request a hearing before the Commission.
The Commission shall follow the procedures and have the authority set forth in
Sections
1107.05 to
1107.21 of the Zoning Code as applicable, when undertaking any such hearing.
The party requesting the modification or contesting the location of the
riparian setback or the ordinary high water mark of a watercourse shall have
the burden of proof in case of any such hearing.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1179.17 INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)    Riparian setbacks shall be inspected by the Zoning Inspector when:
      (1)    A preliminary subdivision plat or other land development plan is
submitted to the Village.
      (2)    A building permit is requested.
      (3)    Prior to any soil disturbing activity to inspect the delineation
of riparian setbacks as required under these regulations.
   (b)    Riparian setbacks shall also be inspected periodically by the Zoning
Inspector for compliance with approvals under Section
1179.11 of these regulations or at any time evidence is brought to the
attention of the Zoning Inspector that uses or structures are occurring that
may reasonably be expected to violate the provisions of these regulations.

clear view by drivers of motor vehicles.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1181.13 FENCES, WALLS, COLUMNS AND HEDGES.
   Fences, walls, columns and/or hedges may be permitted in any required yard,
or along the edge of any yard, subject to zoning permit requirements provided
in this Code.
   (a)   Front and Front Sides. Fences, walls, columns and/or hedges along the
sides (but not the front edge), of any front yard shall not be over three (3)
feet in height from the property edge closest to the road or street to the
front building line of the principal building, when located perpendicular to
the road or street. When a fence located along the front edge of the front lot
line connects to a fence located along the side edge of a side yard, the front
yard fence along the road shall transition to three (3) feet in height at the
connection with the side yard fence.
      Fences, wall, columns and/or hedges that are erected as a landscape/
design feature and located along front edge of a yard, and parallel to the road
or street, can be up to six (6) feet in height so long as they do not create a
sight obstruction as determined by the Director of Planning and Zoning or his/
her designee. Generally, the diagram below provides example of a scenario in
which a fence may be deemed a sight obstruction.
      Columns and access gates (inclusive of lights, ornamental features and
structural elements) located on either side of a driveway can be up to eight
(8) feet tall as a means to demarcate the entrance to the property, so long as
they do not create a sight obstruction as determined by the Director of

   (b)   Rear and Rear Sides. Fences, wall, columns and/or hedges may be
permitted along the rear, side and/or rear lot lines to a height of not more
than six (6) feet above the grade in residential zones, and ten (10) feet above
the grade in all other zones, provided that at least twenty-five percent (25%)
of the vertical surface of any fence or wall shall be open to light and air,
that any fence, wall, column and/or hedge shall be well maintained, harmonious
and appropriate in appearance with the existing character of the immediate area
in which it is to be located, and not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or
future neighboring uses. However, informal planting may be higher than six (6)
feet. Solid walls, columns, and fences that do not maintain at least twenty-
five percent (25%) of the vertical surface open to light and air shall conform
to all required setback lines for yards.
   All lighting associated with fences, walls, columns and/or hedges must be
shielded and located in a such a manner as to not intrude onto the public road
or streets and adjacent/nearby properties. Said lighting shall also be
compliant with the International Dark-Sky Association, or equivalent. The
Director of Planning and zoning is authorized to require a photometrics plan if
he/she believes the lighting is intrusive and does not comply with this

1181.15 TEMPORARY BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES AND PORTABLE STORAGE CONTAINERS.
   Temporary buildings or structures for uses incidental to construction work
for public improvement projects may be erected within the district(s) in which
the work is taking place. The exact location of said temporary buildings or
structures is subject to the approval of the Zoning Inspector. However, such
temporary buildings or structures shall be removed upon completion or
abandonment of the construction work.
   Portable storage containers are prohibited in all residential Zoning
Districts except: (a) during active construction on a residential property,
three (3) portable storage containers may be placed on the property where
construction is taking place during the first sixty (60) days of active
construction; and (b) when someone is moving in or out of a residential
property, three (3) temporary storage containers may be placed on the
residential property for a period of no more than ten (10) days, unless
otherwise authorized by the Director of Planning and Zoning.
   A zoning certificate is required before any portable storage container can
be placed in a residential Zoning District under subsection (a) or (b).
   In non-residential districts, three (3) portable storage containers may be
placed on a property as a non-permanent accessory use solely to provide
temporary storage during the duration of an active construction project taking
place on the same property, adjacent property under common ownership, or on
municipally owned land. If more than three (3) portable storage containers are
needed, approval of the request for additional storage containers must be made
during the development plan review process with Planning Commission. The
portable storage container(s) shall be removed upon completion or abandonment
of the construction work.
   For the avoidance of doubt, a portable storage container is prohibited as a
permanent accessory storage structure or building everywhere in the Village.
(Ord. 48-2023. Passed 9-5-23.)
1181.17 SWIMMING POOLS.
   Public or private swimming pools shall be considered as structures for the

Village or Summit County building codes applicable to such pools.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1181.19 HAZARDOUS OR NOXIOUS EMISSIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.
   (a)   No use shall be permitted or authorized to be established which, when
conducted in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Code and any
additional conditions and requirements prescribed, is or may become hazardous,
noxious or offensive due to the emission of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas,
fumes, noise, vibration, electrical interference, refuse matter or water
carried wastes.
   (b)   Regardless of any other provision of this Zoning Code, no land shall
be used and no structure erected or maintained in violation of any State or
Federal pollution control or environmental protection law or regulation. In the
case of a new building and use, the proponent thereof shall offer satisfactory
evidence to determine that the proposal will not, if effective, result in any
adverse effect on the quality of the human environment.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1181.21 TOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEY.
   (a)    New Residential Dwellings. Before a zoning certificate for the
construction of a new residential dwelling structure is issued, the applicant
for a permit therefore shall submit to the Zoning Inspector a topographical
survey of the premises upon which such building or structure is to be erected.
Such survey shall be performed by a registered surveyor who shall stake out the
premises and the building site by offset, and such stakes shall be caused to
remain in the ground until final inspection of the buildings or structure has
been completed.
   (b)    Additions. If the Zoning Inspector deems it appropriate when a
proposed addition and/or alteration will change the present topography or if
the square footage of the proposed addition will exceed the square footage of
the existing structure or if the proposed addition will change the water flow
between properties, then the Zoning Inspector may refer the plans for the
proposed addition to the Village Engineer to determine whether a topographical
survey is required.

1181.25 ESTABLISHMENT OF GRADE.
   Before issuing a zoning certificate for the construction of a new
residential dwelling, the Zoning Inspector shall request the Village Engineer
to establish a grade for such building or structure. After a building permit
has been issued and construction commenced, but before proceeding beyond the
completion of the pouring of footers for such building or structure, the Zoning
Inspector shall request a further inspection by the Engineer. The Engineer
shall at such time determine whether such footers have been constructed in
accordance with the established grade. The Zoning Inspector shall not permit
continuation of construction beyond the pouring of footers for any building or
structure until the inspection has been made and the construction approved by
the Engineer.
(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)

(Ord. 25-2011. Passed 9-20-11.)
1181.29 HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY.
   The purpose of the Historic District Overlay is to regulate new construction
and additions or renovations to existing historic buildings in the Historic
District and any properties zoned Commercial Historic, but located outside of
the formal Historic District. Historic buildings are structures that are at
least 100 years old, using 2015 as the base year. These regulations also apply
to all new buildings constructed after the adoption of this Section. Existing
non-historic buildings (less than 100 years old) may be renovated and expanded
using materials, styles and architectural details consistent with the existing
building design. The regulation and guidelines in this Section are based on a
2014 study conducted by the Village Planning Commission and adopted in
September 2015.
   (a)   The following applies to all historic homes that are at least 100
years of age and located within the Historic District of the Village (as
identified on the Official Zoning Map of Richfield) and within the Commercial
Historic Zoning District. The Historic District boundaries were created by
Village Council in February 1995 by Resolution 62-1994.
      (1)   Style of Buildings: The style of buildings shall be compatible to
or match the building styles of the historic structures existing within the
Richfield Historic District which is substantially "Western Reserve" in
character made up of    primarily Federal, Greek Revival and Colonial Revival
(Georgian) styles. Other    historic styles evident in the district include:
Queen Anne, Italianate and Vernacular (Victorian and Stick).
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities of a historic building or
structure shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic
materials or distinctive architectural features shall not occur whenever
possible.
      (3)   Existing houses which are converted to commercial uses shall retain
the     residential character and general construction design of the period of
the structure.
      (4)   The design elements of a building addition shall match the design
elements of the principal structure, in particular, building materials and
color, rooflines and    shapes, and window proportions and alignment.
      (5)   The scale of an addition shall be compatible with the principal
structure and surrounding structures and context.
      (6)   Original materials shall be repaired, restored and reused whenever
possible. Original materials shall not be removed or covered whenever possible.
Where necessary, missing or deteriorated materials shall be replaced with
appropriate recycled or new materials, which match the original as closely as
possible.
      (7)   Building form: The building form shall be rectangular or a series
of attached rectangular forms of 1 story, 1.5 story or 2 stories in height.
      (8)   Additions and wings: Attached wings shall be at 90 degrees to the
main structure and typically of a lower height in stories and/or roof peak. For
example a two story main building might have a 1.5 story side addition and a
1.5 story structure might have a one story addition or multiple additions. The
typical form would be a "T" or "L" floor plan, but may have additional wings in
"I" or "H" forms.
      (9)   Roofs: Roofs of buildings shall generally be in gable form with a
front or side orientation. In the case of multiple wings, the gables would be
combination of side and front gable forms. Typically the addition roof gables
are lower than the gable of the main structure due to the lower story height of
the wing additions. Hip form roof can be an acceptable alternative roof style.
      (10)   Building Details: Building details shall include those elements
that are appropriate to the style of the structure to embellish the structure
and promote the historic nature of the district. The elements to be included
depending upon style are: deep cornices under gable ends and eaves, cornice
returns (open pediments) or full pediment gables, pedimented window and
entrance door frames, multi-pane windows with appropriate muntins, millwork,
cornice brackets, railing and porch spindles, entrance features including
porches or pilasters, entablature and/or side lights, fanlight windows or
vents.
      (11)   Windows: Windows shall be double hung with panes of one over one,
two over two or six over six depending upon the style of building. For example
the Federal and Greek Revival would generally have six over six panes or more.
Windows should be equally and symmetrically spaced across the entire front
façade and side facades visible from a street. Second floor windows should be
inline and evenly spaced to match the window pattern on the first floor. There
should be no blank wall visible from the street without a consistent pattern of
window openings. Windows shall have side moldings and lintels which may be
pedimented depending on building style. Windows can have shutters if
appropriate to the building style. If shutters are used they shall be provided
for    windows on both the front and sides of the building. Shutters, if
installed, shall be sized to match the width and height of the windows so they
are in the same dimension as one half the width of the window opening and the
full length of the window opening.
      (12)   Building Materials:
         A.   Walls: The materials for facades shall generally be horizontal
siding in wood clapboard or fiber cement board to appear as clapboard.
Depending on the building style, Victorian shingle siding (such as fish scale
or square) can be used as a secondary material. Architectural vinyl (thickness
equal to 0.046" or greater)    to duplicate wood clapboard and shingles can
also be used. Red fired-brick and    stone may also be used for building
facades.
         B.   Trim Materials: Trim material shall be wood or fiber cement board
simulating wood. Molding, brackets, cornices, spindles and railings should be
wood or synthetic material (such as rigid PVC) simulating wood details.
         C.   Window Materials: Windows shall be constructed of wood, vinyl or
metal clad wood, full vinyl or fiberglass.
         D.   Roof Materials: Roofs shall be limited to shingles including
asphalt, architectural fiberglass, slate or synthetic slate and standing seam.
Shingle roofs should be black, grey or a dark color such as dark brown or dark
green. Standing seam roofs shall be limited to greys, browns, dark green or a
pale green simulating a copper    patina color.
      (13)   Façade colors: The primary color on building facades shall be
white, if siding is used. Alternative colors can include grey or earth tones
(including beige, cream, yellow, ochre or tan). In addition, Vernacular,
Victorian, Stick and Italianate styles may include dark colors such as green,
blue and ochre. Brick facades shall be in standard red fired-brick to match the
existing brick in the district.
      (14)   Trim colors: Trim shall be complimentary to the building main
color and is typically white or black in the case of traditional Western
Reserve styles. In addition earth tone colors (including beige, cream, yellow,
ochre or tan) can be used as well as contrasting colors in the case of a
Vernacular Victorian building style. Shutters if used shall be black or a dark
color such as dark green or a dark earth tone. Vernacular and Victorian style
may include two contrasting colors in shutters, doors and trim.
      (15)   Garages: Garages were not part of historic homes until the
beginning of the last century and afterwards automobile garages were detached
until mid-century.    Garages and especially garage doors should not be seen as
part of the main building. Garages shall be detached (in the rear of the house)
or attached such that the entrance doors are on the rear or side of the
building not facing the street. Any walls of an attached garage shall appear as
an integral form of the building with identical siding material, colors and
have evenly spaced windows matching the style and spacing of the remainder of
the house. No garage doors of an attached garage shall face the street on the
front façade of the building. On a house on a corner lot the garage doors may
face a street on the side street or side wall of a building. In general,
accessory buildings shall be compatible in design and material as the main
structure.
      (16)   Lighting: Lighting shall be human scale and compatible with the
architectural period of the home. Lighting shall not produce glare and
unnecessary diffusion onto adjoining properties.
   (b)   The following regulations and guidelines apply to institutional or
other large non-single family buildings in the residential portions of the
Historic District.
      (1)   All new construction, building renovations and additions shall be
compatible with and contribute to the historic character of the district.
      (2)   Buildings shall promote the "Western Reserve" style and limited to
Federal, Greek Revival and Georgian (Colonial Revival) styles of building. The
current institutional buildings in the district all fit this description and
while large in area are primarily low in impact due to their typical one-story
height, vast land areas and mimicking the historic styles.
      (3)   The percentage of building footprint to land area shall be no more
than that found on residential properties at 15% building coverage for one-
story buildings and 10% for a two-story buildings.
      (4)   Buildings shall be limited to no more than two-stories in height
and preferably one-story in height due to the roof heights required for a
larger building footprint. Large buildings should have lower one-story wings or
additions in order to reduce the perceived mass of the building and incorporate
a primary design of the    Western Reserve style.
      (5)   Building setbacks shall be not less than 100 feet from a public
street and not less than as may be required for a Conditional Use in Section
1173.09.
      (6)   Roof forms shall be limited to gable roofs with deep cornices and
finished in shingles (colors of black, grey or a dark color such as dark brown)
or standing seam (colors limited to grey, dark brown, dark green or a pale
green simulating a copper patina color.
      (7)   The materials used shall be high quality and primarily faced in red
fired brick especially on the street façade. A secondary material can include
clapboard siding, stone, or synthetic wood or stone.
      (8)   Windows should be federal style windows and details with multi-
paned (6 over 6 or greater) evenly and symmetrically spaced around the entire
perimeter of the building, where practical.
      (9)   Entrances shall have substantial features such as porch, porte-
cochere, or entrance with pilasters, entablature, side-lights and/or pediment.
      (10)   Parking lots shall be placed in the rear of the building. They
shall be screened with dense landscaping from view to street and any adjacent
residential properties.
      (11)   Site features such as service entrances and loading zones shall be
screened from adjacent properties and the public right-of-way and located in
the side or rear of the lot.
      (12)   Lighting fixtures shall be architectural period style matching the
building style with night or dark sky optics. Lighting shall further be
minimized through the use of timers and lighting shall be restricted to the
exact space being illuminated. The use of bollard fixtures not exceeding four
feet in height shall be utilized whenever applicable.
      (13)   Utility services on private property shall be placed underground
for all new services.
      (14)   Mechanical equipment shall be located so as not to be visible from
any public ways or adjacent residential areas. Where such limitation is not
possible, the facilities shall be screened from public view with materials
compatible with those used in the building.
      (15)   All trash containers and trash storage areas shall be screened
with a six-foot high enclosure on three sides and a solid gate on the front.
The enclosure shall be similar to the main structure as to materials and color.

   This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property Maintenance Code of the
Village of Richfield. (Ord. 76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)
1307.02 SCOPE.
   The chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of minimum standards
for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning units of all
structures, buildings and uses within the Village, including yard areas
immediately contiguous thereto. No provisions of this chapter shall, in any
way, directly or indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the
right of, any owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by
them in such manner and form as they may determine appropriate, consistent with
other applicable provisions of law. This chapter is directed to obvious visual
problems which may occasion incipient blighting conditions within the Village.
All matters of the interior use, occupancy or habitation of any structure or
building within the Village are specifically excluded from the provisions of
this chapter. (Ord. 76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)
1307.03 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance
and exterior condition of all premises and uses throughout the Village; to fix
certain responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents and managers of the
same as to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties; to
authorize and establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such premises
and uses; to fix penalties for the violations of this chapter; and to provide
for the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use. This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and essential
for the public interest, and it is intended that this chapter be construed and
interpreted to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
(Ord. 76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)
1307.04 APPLICABILITY.
   Every building, occupancy or use shall comply with the provisions of this
chapter, whether or not such building or use shall have been constructed,
altered or repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter, and without
regard to any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or
occupancy of the building premises, for the construction or repair of the
building or use, or for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities
prior to the effective date of this chapter. This chapter establishes minimum
standards for the initial and continued occupancy and use of all such
structures and does not replace or modify standards otherwise established for
the construction, repair, alteration or use of the building. Where there is
mixed occupancy, residential or nonresidential use therein shall be
nevertheless regulated by and subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord.
76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)
1307.05 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance by the Village or law of the State, then
the standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the
Village or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such
other ordinance or law shall prevail. (Ord. 76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)
1307.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   The enforcement of any and all provisions of this chapter is placed with the
Zoning Inspector, and additional enforcement officers including but not limited
to Summit County Building Department, Summit County Health Department, Village
Police Department, and Village Fire Department as they believe may be required
shall carry out and effectuate all of the provisions herein.
   (a)   Inspection. All buildings, premises, and uses within the Village are
subject to exterior inspections from time to time by the Zoning Inspector.
   (b)   Notice.
      (1)   Where a violation of any provision of this chapter is found to
exist, the Zoning Inspector shall cause a written notice of such violation to
be served upon the person responsible for the correction thereof. The notice
shall specify the violation committed and shall provide for a reasonable period
of time, not more than ninety days, to correct or abate the violation. In the
event that weather is a major consideration in correcting or abating the
violation, the Zoning Inspector may extend the time set out herein to not more
than sixty days immediately following the occurrence of appropriate weather
conditions.
      (2)   Notice shall be served by certified mail to the owner of the
property appearing on the current record of the county auditor and to the last
known address to the tenant to be served. If the last known address of the
tenant cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be posted on the outside front
entrance of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)   In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a Final Order as to
administrative proceedings.
   (c)   Appeal.
      (1)   Within fourteen days of the date of service of notice, any person
affected by the notice may request a hearing thereof before the Board of Zoning
Appeals by filing a written request with the Zoning Inspector. The Chairperson
of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall set the matter down for
hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Zoning Appeals,
allowing at least five days notice to the party and the Zoning Inspector. The
Board of Zoning Appeals may sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole or in part any
action required to correct or abate the violation set forth in the notice and
shall issue an order incorporating its determinations, and such order shall be
a Final Order as to these administrative proceedings.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Zoning
Inspector shall not, in any material way, alter the standards of this chapter
and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants, or the
health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of
the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, manager or resident, by reason of compelling an
expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to the health, safety or welfare of the
community that might be derived therefrom.
No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this chapter
shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve
any owner, manager or resident from complying with any such other provision,
nor any official of the Village from enforcing any such other provision.
      (Ord. 76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)
1307.07 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.

unoccupied or an inoperative nuisance, notice shall be given in the same manner
as service of summons in civil cases or by certified mail addressed to the
owner of record of the premises at his last known address or to the address to
which tax bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to
abate such unoccupied or inoperative nuisance condition within thirty days
either by placing the structure in operation in accordance with this Section,
adapting and using the structure for another use permitted in the Zoning
District or by razing the structure, removing all debris, any signs, goods,
supplies and equipment, and filing depressions to the grade level of the lot,
provided, however, that if the structure is in use at the time notice is given
and remaining in operation for ninety consecutive days, the provisions of this
Section shall not apply.
   (d)   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the
notice to abate such unoccupied or inoperative nuisance, the Zoning Inspector
shall advise the Law Director of all the facts and the Law Director shall
proceed to exercise on behalf of the Village and remedy which shall then be
available to it to secure an abatement of such unoccupied or inoperative
nuisance, including any that pertains to the abatement of a public nuisance,
and to recover any damages or enforce any penalties which may be recovered or
imposed at the instance of the Village, including all damages reasonable under
Ohio R.C. 715.26 and 715.261.
   (e)   The remedies contained in this Section shall be cumulative and shall
apply in addition to any other remedial sections in this Code, including but
not specifically limited to, Section
1301.07 of the building code. (Ord. 76-1996. Passed 12-17-96.)

1309.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of Richfield, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Richfield has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:   
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Richfield as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Village of Richfield.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
(Panels 40, 85, 105) and Flood Insurance Rate Map, Summit County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas, both effective July 20, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Richfield as required by Section
1309.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file in the office of the Zoning Inspector, Village of
Richfield, 4410 West Streetsboro Road, Richfield, Ohio 44286.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Richfield, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 54-2009. Passed 10-20-09.)
1309.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall first be interpreted according to the definitions set forth
in Chapter 1135, if applicable, or otherwise so as to give them the meaning
they have in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable
application.
   (1)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.

   (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban

   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.

depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus one and one-half (1.5) feet of freeboard. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodplain Administrator. The Floodplain Administrator is the Mayor
or his designee.
   (18)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (19)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (20)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Richfield's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (21)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (22)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (23)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (24)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (25)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (26)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (27)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Richfield
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 20, 2009, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (28)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C. 111.15 as
any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the General
Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or any
court.
   (29)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (30)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (31)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (32)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (33)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (34)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (35)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (36)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (37)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure."
   (38)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (39)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 54-2009. Passed 10-20-09.)
1309.03 ADMINISTRATION.

apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation and floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data
available from a federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations exist or where the preliminary base flood elevations exceed
the base flood elevations in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.
Such preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard in the field. A person contesting the determination of the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1309.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 54-2009. Passed 10-20- 09.)

pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
Variance Application Fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Village of
Richfield.
      (2)   Public hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.

substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A.1. to 11.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Summit Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 54-2009. Passed 10-20-09.)

1515.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   The National Fire Prevention Code along with the rules promulgated by
the American Insurance Association are hereby modified and amended by the
enactment of this chapter.
   (b)   Air testing of tanks with product inside is prohibited. The piping
systems shall be air tested to withstand at least 150% of its anticipated
pressures or 100 pounds PSI whichever is greater. If such testing reveals that
any leaking conditions exist, the permit shall be revoked, and the Fire Chief
shall order the owner or operator from using such tanks or piping until the
leaking condition is corrected. In the case where a dual occupancy may exist
and there exists a leaking condition, all occupancies on the property shall
cease operations until the conditions are corrected and tested. A statement of
the tests validity shall be received by the Village of Richfield before
reoccupying businesses. There shall not exist any hazardous or dangerous
condition to persons or property.
   (c)   Daily inventory records for the underground storage of flammable and
combustible liquids are mandatory and shall be maintained for every underground
storage tank within the Village.
      (1)   The procedures for inventory control are as follows:
         A.   The inventory referred to shall be based on the actual
measurement of tank liquid levels daily. The written record of such testing
shall include a computation of daily gain or loss. The operator of the location
shall be responsible for taking action to correct any abnormal loss or gain not
explainable by spillage, temperature variations or other causes. Such abnormal
loss or gain shall be reported promptly by the operator to the Village.
         B.   The mere recording of pump meter readings combined with
inshipment records shall not constitute adequate inventory records for the
purpose of this rule.
         C.   Exemptions. The requirements for daily inventory records shall
not apply in the following situations:
            1.   Daily inventories are not required to be maintained when an
installation is not in operation, except that during such a period when an
installation is not in operation an inventory must be taken at least once every
seven days.
      (2)   The following actions shall be taken by the operator daily:
         A.   The operator shall record all meter totalizer readings,
immediately gauge and record all tank measurements and balance inventory and
product transferred.
         B.   The operator shall record and make adjustments for all transfers
of products occurring during gauging period.
         C.   The operator shall retain all of the aforementioned records.
         D.   The operator shall check all tanks for water. Experience will
indicate whether daily checks are required or if they can be made less
frequently. In any circumstances, the check for water shall be made at least
once a week. Tanks should be checked for water after a thaw and after a
delivery.
   (d)   In the event of unexplained inventory discrepancies and reasonable
certainty that a leak exists, or if the daily inventory records are not
maintained, the Village may require the procedures for locating and testing
underground leaks and pipe test as presented in N.F.P.A. No. 329 and Sections
1301.7-7-28(A), (E), (I), (J) and (K) of the Ohio Administrative Code [Article

release or an Underground Storage Tank shall be taken according to EPA
procedure SW846. The lab shall provide proof that the samples were received the
same way they were taken at the site. A copy of this proof shall be forwarded
to the Fire Department. If there are any discrepancies, the sample shall not be
accepted.
   (c)   The storage of used steel or fiberglass storage tanks shall not be
permitted above ground or below ground and shall be disposed of properly. A
special permit from the Fire Department may be issued as an exception to this
rule. The permit may be renewable every twelve months. If the rules set forth
