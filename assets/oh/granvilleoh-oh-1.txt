ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 19-78
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE 1978 CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO
REPEAL ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW
MATTER; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of recodification and general revision
of its ordinances before it for some time, and
   WHEREAS, Council has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
Council,
NOW, THEREFORE, Be it ordained by the Council of Granville, Ohio that:
Section I: The ordinances of Granville, Ohio, of a general and permanent
nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and enacted
as the Codified Ordinances of Granville, Ohio, 1978.
One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct by
the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of Granville, Ohio.
Section II: The provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in Section
IV of this ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted
prior to May 16, 1978, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
ordinance, except as follows:
(a)The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to affect a
right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provisions prior
to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for the
enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be construed
to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in violation of any
such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or prosecution
therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall continue in
full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and
recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way.
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to May 16, 1978.
   Section III: Pursuant to Charter Sections 3.06 and 3.12, the Clerk of
Council shall post copies of the Codified Ordinances along with a copy of this
ordinance in the three public places as set forth in Section
113.01 of the Codified Ordinances. Each section of the Codified Ordinances
without a previous ordinance or resolution history, or containing a subsection
with the words "Adopting Ordinance, " at the end thereof indicates that the
section contains new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.
   Section IV: This ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the Municipality and its inhabitants, and for the further reason
that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of
Granville, so as to facilitate the administration and daily operation of
Granville and avoid practical and legal entanglements. Wherefore, this
ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and immediately after its
passage.
   Passed this 1st day of November, 1978.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is . 06. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Granville was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Granville Codified Ordinances is indicated.

emergency in the operation of the municipal government, or which is necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, safety, health, morals or

SECTION 3.06.  PUBLICATION OF NOTICES AND ORDINANCES.
   Whenever publication of any summary, notice or ordinance is required under
this Charter, it may be accomplished either:
   (1)   By publication in a news or advertising medium which is distributed to

SECTION 3.07. EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES; EXCEPTIONS TO REFERENDUM.
   Emergency ordinances, except an emergency ordinance for the acquisition of
real property, not including roadways and/or utility easements, ordinances
raising revenue, except an ordinance which directs the sale or delivery of the
product of any public utility to anyone outside the Municipality, or for street
improvements petitioned for by sixty percent or more of the owners or by the
owners of a majority of the feet front property benefited and to be specially
assessed for the cost thereof, and those making appropriations for current
operating expenses of the Municipality, shall take effect upon passage, and
shall not be subject to referendum. Whenever Council is required to pass more
than one ordinance to complete a public improvement project, a referendum may
be held on the first ordinance passed, but not on any subsequent ordinance in
the series. All other ordinances shall take effect thirty days after passage in
order to afford an opportunity for the filing of referendum petitions. (Amended
11-2-04)
SECTION 3.08. INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, ordinances may be
proposed or submitted to popular vote by initiative and referendum petition.
Petitions are subject to the procedures of this section and not Sections 731.28
to 731.35 of the Ohio Revised Code. However, petitions are subject to Sections
731.36, 731.38, 731.40, 731.99, and 3501.38 of the Ohio Revised Code and to
other sections of the Ohio Revised Code generally applicable to municipal
elections and electors. Petitions and the signatures on petitions are presumed,
prima facie, to be sufficient. No petition shall be declared invalid in its
entirety when one or more signatures are found to be invalid, except when the
total number of valid signatures is found to be less than fifteen percent of
the number of municipal electors who voted for the office of Governor at the
last gubernatorial election. After the Board of Elections certifies the results
of an election held under this section, the election shall not be set aside,
and no ordinance submitted to and approved by the electors under this section
shall be held ineffective or void, on account of insufficiency or defect of the
petition by which the submission of the ordinance was procured.
   (B)   To initiate an ordinance or submit an ordinance to referendum, before
collecting signatures:
      (1)   Initiative petitioners must file a written notice with the Clerk of
Council or other person designated to receive notices on behalf of Council, or
if there is no Clerk or designee, with the Village Manager. The notice must
state intent to file an initiative petition and identify by name, address and
telephone number a designated representative of the petitioners. The
petitioners must also attach a copy of the proposed ordinance to be initiated
to the notice. A proposed ordinance must contain a title and body and contain
only one subject clearly set forth in the title, as ordinances proposed by
members of Council under Section
 3.02 of this Charter. The ordinance may contain an opening clause reading, “Be
it ordained by the people of Granville, Ohio,” or words of similar meaning, but
this is not required.
      (2)   Referendum petitioners must file a written notice of intent to
circulate a referendum petition with the Clerk, designee, or Manager stating
the number and title of the ordinance. The Clerk, designee, or Manager shall
immediately obtain a copy of the ordinance identified in the notice from the
village files and attach it to the notice.
      (3)   The Clerk, designee, or Manager shall stamp or mark either type of
notice of intent and attached ordinance or proposed ordinance with the date and
time it is received, make a copy of the notice and ordinance, stamp or mark the
copy with the same date and time as the original, give the copy to the person
who files the notice, and publish a notice under Section 3.06 of this Charter
that the notice and ordinance have been filed and are available for public
inspection at the municipal office.
      (4)   Petitioners may change designation of a representative at any time
by filing a notice of change with the Clerk, designee, or Manager, stating the
name, address, and telephone number of the new designated representative.
   (C)   After the date and time of the filing of the notice of intent,
petitioners may collect signatures of qualified municipal electors on the
petition. A petition may be circulated in parts, but each part must contain the
title of the ordinance or resolution to be initiated or referred. When they are
finished collecting signatures, petitioners must file all parts of the petition
together with the Clerk, designee, or Manager, who shall immediately publish
notice under section
3.06 of this Charter that the petition is now available for public inspection
at the municipal office.
   (D)   Except as provided in division (H) of this section, a referendum
petition must be filed within thirty days after Council approves the ordinance
to be referred. If a referendum petition is filed, the ordinance challenged
does not take effect until:
      (1)   if the thirty-day period is extended under division (H) of this
section for the collection of additional signatures but the petitioners file no
additional signatures, the day after the date to which the time for collection
of additional signatures was extended under division (H);
      (2)   when an insufficient number of additional signatures are obtained
under division (H) of this section, five days after the Board of Elections
certifies that the number of signatures is insufficient to place the issue on
the ballot;
      (3)   thirty days after the petition is rejected by the municipality and
the petitioners fail to bring a legal action to reinstate it under division (K)
of this section;
      (4)   thirty days after the Board of Elections or a court rejects or
rules against the referendum petition in an action brought under division (F)
or (K) of this section, or any other action to defeat the petition, and no
appeal or other legal action has been filed to contest the decision; or
      (5)   five days after the results of the election are certified, as
provided in division (J) of this section.
   (E)   The petition and notice of intent and the attached ordinance or
proposed ordinance filed under division (B) of this section shall be kept
together in the municipal office for public inspection for ten days after the
first publication of notice under Section
3.06 (1) or
3.06 (2) of this Charter or the first posting of notice under section
3.06 (3) if no medium for publication is available under Section
3.06 (1) or (2). The municipality may make additional copies available for
public inspection if demand requires and shall take care to preserve the
security and integrity of all documents.
   (F)   The municipality may reject an initiative or referendum petition only
for failure to file a notice under division (B) (1) of this section or to
attach an ordinance with a title and body to that notice, for failure to file a
notice of referendum under division (B) (2) of this section, or because the
petition does not contain on its face signatures equaling or exceeding fifteen
percent of the number of municipal electors who voted for the office of
Governor at the last gubernatorial election. To reject a petition for any other
reason, the municipality must apply to the Board of Elections in a case where
it has jurisdiction to review the petition, or to a court of competent
jurisdiction where the board lacks jurisdiction. If the municipality takes such
an action, the petitioners have standing as a party to the action.
   (G)   On the eleventh day after the publication of notice required by
division (B) of this section, the Clerk, designee, or Manager shall transmit
the petition to the Board of Elections for validation of signatures. The Board
of Elections shall examine the signatures on the petition, determine the number
that are valid, notify the Clerk, designee, or Manager in writing of that
number and whether it equals or exceeds fifteen percent of the number of
municipal electors who voted for Governor at the last gubernatorial election,
and return the petition to the Clerk, designee, or Manager as soon as possible.
   (H)   If the Clerk, designee, or Manager receives written notice from the
Board of Elections that a petition does not have sufficient, valid signatures
to submit it to the electors, or if the municipality rejects the petition for
that reason, the Clerk shall immediately notify the representative of the
petitioners identified in the notice filed under division (B) of this section
by telephone, if possible, and by written notice mailed with return receipt
requested. Petitioners shall have ten days after the representative receives
the written notice to file additional signatures on additional part- petitions.
The additional part-petitions are subject to division (C) of this section. This
additional ten-day period applies to a referendum petition even if it extends
the time for filing the final petition beyond the thirty-day time limit of
division (D) of this section. The Clerk, designee, or Manager shall publish
notice, as under division (C) of this section, that additional signatures are
now available for public inspection at the municipal office. On the tenth day
after the first publication of this notice, the Clerk, designee, or Manager
shall transmit the entire petition to the Board of Elections for validation of
the additional signatures. The board shall examine and return the entire
petition, as under division (G) of this section.
   (I)   If the Board of Elections determines that a petition contains valid
signatures equaling or exceeding fifteen percent of the number who voted for
Governor at the last gubernatorial election, it shall submit the ordinance to
the electorate at the next primary or general election occurring more than
ninety days after the board declares the number of signatures sufficient,
unless within ten days after the date the Board notifies the Clerk, designee,
or manager that the petition contains sufficient signatures, the municipality
rejects the petition or takes legal action to reject it , as provided in
division (F) of this section.
   (J)   Initiated ordinances approved and ordinances submitted to referendum
and sustained by a majority of those voting take effect on the fifth day after
the day on which the Board of Elections certifies the official vote on such
question.
   (K)   Failure of the municipality or any of its officers, employees,
divisions, departments, or agencies, or of the Board of Elections to comply
exactly with the requirements of this section does not invalidate a petition.
If the municipality or any of its officers, employees, divisions, departments,
or agents, or the Board of Elections, fails or refuses to comply with a
requirement of this section, he, she, or it may be compelled to do so by writ
of mandamus. If the municipality wrongfully rejects a petition, it may be
compelled to reinstate it by writ of mandamus.
   (L)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “general election,” and “primary election” have the same meanings
as in section 3501.01 of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (2)   “valid signature” means the signature of a qualified elector that
meets the requirements of this section and general election law; and
      (3)   “qualified elector” means a person who meets the requirements of
Section 1 of Article V of the Constitution of Ohio and Section 3503.01 of the
Ohio Revised Code.

the code without reproducing it at length in the ordinance. However, if the
Council desires to modify, add to or eliminate from any such code any section
or part thereof, such addition, modification or omission shall be clearly
stated in the ordinance. In all cases in which such a code is adopted by

ordinance, or which is not of general public application or interest, may be
taken by resolution. Such a resolution shall be introduced by a member of
Council and may be adopted by a voice vote of a majority of the members
present. If adopted it shall be assigned a resolution number and reduced to
writing. No waiting period, notice, hearing or publication shall be required,
and a resolution shall become effective upon its adoption. The Clerk of Council
shall record resolutions by number, at length, in a separate book, which shall
be a public record.
(Amended 11-3-81)
SECTION 3.11. ADMINISTRATIVE CODE.
   Subject to this Charter, and after consultation with the Manager, Council
shall adopt an Administrative Code that provides in detail the organization of
the municipal government, defines the powers and duties of each organizational
unit, and determines the administrative procedures to be followed. Council may
delegate to the Manager, and he or she to the heads of departments, power to

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a) The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b) An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c) The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

(d) If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by a
re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

(c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
(a) If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a number,
the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
          (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
(b) An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
(c) If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of
Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the Municipality,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

Constitution and Article
II of the Municipal Charter; and
      (2)   The authorization and establishment of such policies and procedures

147.03 DEPOSITORIES.
(a) The Manager shall determine the amount of public moneys which shall be
available in active deposits to provide the needed cash flow to pay warrants
and checks issued and outstanding, and to provide for a reasonable surplus in
addition to the amount needed to pay such warrants and checks, and to maximize
the interest received on public moneys. Interest on active deposits shall be
paid or credited by the Municipality's designated eligible depositories at
least quarterly and when funds are withdrawn, computing the time of payment
from the date of deposit. No service charge shall be made by a designated
eligible depository against an active deposit or collected from or paid by the
Director of Finance unless such service charge is the same as is customarily
imposed by institutions receiving money on deposit subject to check, in the
Municipality in which event the Director of Finance may pay such charge. All
public moneys not deposited in active deposits shall be invested pursuant to
Section
147.05.
(b) The Manager shall, by a writing filed with the Clerk of Council, designate
one or more eligible depositories as the depository or depositories of the
Municipality's active deposits. In making such designation the Manager shall
consider the following:
      (1)   The convenience by the location of the depository's office;
      (2)   The rate or rates of interest, if any, which the depository will
pay on the active deposits;
      (3)   The service charges, if any, that will be made for the services of
the depository; and
      (4)   Any other terms or conditions with respect to the depository's
acceptance of the active deposit.

hereinafter provided for. Subsequent designations of depositories for the
active deposits shall be:
      (1)   For a period specified in the Manager's written designation of
depositories pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, which period shall not be less
than six months nor longer than two years, and
      (2)   Shall be made after the Director of Finance has provided written
notice by first-class mail to the eligible depositories having an office in the
Municipality, and such other eligible depositories as determined by the
Director of Finance, at least sixty days prior to the date of the action of the
Manager designating depositories for the active deposits.
Such notice shall:
      (3)   Provide an estimate of the maximum amount of such active deposits
at any time during the period of designation, and the proposed period of
designation or alternative proposed periods of designation;
      (4)   Request such depositories to apply in writing for all or part of
the active deposits on or before a date and time specified in the notice;
      (5)   Request a depository to state in its application the amount of such
active deposits that will be accepted by it, the rate or rates of interest, if
any, that will be paid on such active deposits, the service charges, if any,
that will be made for its services, other terms or conditions with respect to
the depository's acceptance of all or part of the active deposits and the
location of its offices in the Village, or if none are located in the Village,
the location of its nearest offices; and
      (6)   Include or request any other information to or from such
depositories which the Director of Finance deems relevant.
The request for written applications or their receipt does not constitute a
bidding procedure. Rather such request and application are intended to provide
relevant information to the Manager for his or her designation pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof and to provide notice to eligible depositories that the
Municipality will receive applications and proposals for its active deposits.
(d) The Manager shall enter into a contract, approved as to form and content by
the Director of Law, with such depositories for the appropriate period
determined pursuant to subsection (c) hereof. Such contract shall establish the
rate or rates of interest, if any, to be paid by the depository on the
Municipality's active deposits, the service charge, if any, the depository may
make for its services, and other terms or conditions of the depository's
acceptance of the active deposits.
   (e) The limitations on the aggregate amounts of public moneys that may be on
deposit with eligible depositories as set forth in the Uniform Depository Act
shall apply under this chapter. (Ord. 24-83. Passed 9-21-83.)

security for the repayment of all public moneys to be deposited in the
depository during the period of designation pursuant to the award, eligible

amount of such moneys as is at such time insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or by any other agency or instrumentality of the Federal
government or of the State of Ohio as may be approved by the Manager and

deposit with him surety company bonds or other insurance policies approved by
the Manager and Director of Law which, when executed, shall be for an amount

deposit made during the period of designation, the amount of the aggregate
market value of securities required to be pledged and deposited, or of the
surety company bonds required to be deposited or the other insurance coverage
required, shall be equal to the difference between the amount of public moneys
on deposit in such public depository plus the amount to be so deposited, minus
such portion or amount of the aggregate as is at the time insured as provided
in this section. The Director of Finance may require additional eligible
securities to be deposited to provide for any depreciation which may occur in
the market value of any of the securities so deposited.

by any federal government agency, or the Export-Import Bank of Washington;

      (3)   Bonds and other obligations of this State;
      (4)   Bonds and other obligations of any county, township, school
district, municipal corporation, including the Municipality or other legally

deposit, in default in the payment of principal or interest on any of its bonds
or other obligations, for which the full faith and credit of the issuing
subdivision is pledged;

a newspaper of general circulation at the county seat of the county in which
the office of the Director of Finance is located. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18

to the Director of Finance of the purchase money, the Director of Finance shall
transfer such bonds or securities whereupon the absolute ownership of such
bonds or securities shall pass to the purchasers, and any surplus remaining
after deducting the amount due the State or subdivision and expenses of sale
shall be paid to the depository.
(d)    An institution designated as a depository may, by written notice to the
Director of Finance, designate a qualified trustee and deposit the eligible
securities required by this section with the trustee for safekeeping for the
account of the Director of Finance and the institution as a depository, as
their respective rights to and interests in such securities under this section
may appear and be asserted by written notice to or demand upon the trustee
pursuant Ohio R.C. 135.18(D). In such case, the Director of Finance shall
accept the written receipt of the trustee describing the securities which have
been deposited with the trustee by the depository, a copy of which shall also
be delivered to the depository. Thereupon all such securities so deposited with
the trustees are, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18(D), deemed to be pledged with
the Director of Finance and to be deposited with her/him, for all purposes of
this section.
(e)    Council may make provisions for the exchange and release of securities
and the substitution of other eligible securities therefor except where the
depository has deposited eligible securities with a trustee for safekeeping as
provided in this section.

notice and upon the period of authorization stated therein and upon the period
of designation stated therein .

Director of Finance, the depository notifies the Director of Finance and the
trustee of an intended substitution or exchange, and the Director of Finance
fails to object to the trustee as to the eligibility or market value of the
securities being substituted within ten calendar days after the date appearing
on the notice of the proposed substitution. The notice to the Director of
Finance and to the trustee shall be given in writing and delivered personally
or by certified or registered mail with a return receipt requested. The trustee
may assume in any case that the notice has been delivered to the Director of
Finance to be effective, and receipt of the objections must be acknowledged in
writing by the trustee.
      (3)   The Director of Finance gives written authorization for a
substitution or exchange of specific securities.
(h)    The depository shall notify the Director of Finance of any such
substitution or exchange under subsection (g)(1) or (2) hereof. Upon request
from the Director of Finance, the trustee shall furnish a statement of the
securities pledged against such public deposits.
   (i)    Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18(I), any Federal Reserve Bank or branch
thereof located in this State, without compliance with Ohio R.C. 1109.03,
1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18, or this chapter and without becoming subject to
Ohio R. C. 1109.15 or any other law of Ohio relative to the exercise by
corporations of trust powers generally, is qualified to act as trustee for the
safekeeping of securities, under this section. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18(I),
any institution mentioned in Ohio R.C. 135.03 which holds a certificate of
qualification issued by the Superintendent of Banks or any institution
complying with Ohio R.C. 1109.03, 1109.04, 1109.17 and 1109.18 is qualified to
act as trustee for the safekeeping of securities, other than those belonging to
itself, under this section and Ohio R.C. 135.18. Pursuant to Ohio R.C, 135.18,
upon application to him/her in writing by any such institution, the
Superintendent of Banks shall investigate the applicant and ascertain whether
or not it has been authorized to execute and accept trusts in Ohio and has safe
and adequate vaults and efficient supervision thereof for the storage and
safekeeping within Ohio of such securities. If the Superintendent finds that
the applicant has been so authorized and does have such vaults and supervision
thereof, he/she shall, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18, approve the application
and issue a certificate to that effect, the original or any certified copy of
which shall be conclusive evidence that the institution therein named is
qualified to act as trustee for the purpose of this section with respect to
securities other than those belonging to itself.
Notwithstanding the fact that a depository is required to pledge eligible
securities in certain amounts to secure deposits of public moneys, a trustee
shall have no duty or obligation to determine the eligibility, market value or
face value of any securities deposited with the trustee by a depository. This
applies in all situations including, without limitation, a substitution or
exchange of securities.
Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18, any charges or compensation of a designated
trustee for acting as such under this section shall be paid by the depository
and in no event shall be chargeable to the Municipality or to the Director of
Finance or to any officer of the Municipality. Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 135.18,
such charges or compensation shall not be a lien or charge upon the securities
deposited for safekeeping prior or superior to the rights to and interests in
such securities of the Municipality or of the Director of Finance. Pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 135.18, the Director of Finance and her/his bondswomen/bondsmen or
surety shall be relieved from any liability to the Municipality or to the
depository for the loss or destruction of any securities deposited with a
qualified trustee pursuant to this section. (Ord. 24-83. Passed 9-21-82.)

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date.
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

(Ord. 18-86. Passed 11-4-86.)
171.08 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
(a)    Each person who engaged in business, or whose qualifying wage,
commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income are subject to the
tax imposed by this chapter, shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make
and file on or before April 15 in each year, a return with the Tax Commissioner
and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter. A taxpayer on a fiscal year
accounting basis for Federal income tax purposes shall, beginning with his
first fiscal year, any part of which falls within the effective period of this
chapter, file his return within four months from the end of such fiscal year or
period. The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that
the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by
such employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee and paid by him or them to the Tax Commissioner,
shall be accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income,
subject to tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions or other
compensation.
(b)    The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request for the Tax Commissioner setting forth:
      (1)    The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income, earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax; and
      (2)    The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Commissioner may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used in the return for Federal income tax, adjusted to
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
(c)    The return may be filed on a generic form, if the generic form, when
completed and filed, contains all the information required to be submitted with
the Municipality=s prescribed returns, and if the taxpayer or return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the
filing of returns.
   (d)    (1)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return by filing a copy of the taxpayer=s federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
municipal income tax return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)    The Tax Commissioner may deny a taxpayer=s request for extension
if the taxpayer:
                      i.    fails to timely file the request; or
         ii.    fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         iii.    owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         ix.    has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by Section
171.14. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Tax Commissioner shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
 
   (e)    (1)    The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted
at the source, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or where any portion
of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.11, or where an income tax, creditable against the municipal tax pursuant
to Section
171.19 has been paid to another municipality, credit for the amount so paid
shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any,
shall be due and payable at the time of filing such return.
      (2)    A taxpayer, who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter, may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment or part thereof shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five
dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.
         (Ord. 24-03. Passed 12-3-03.)
171.09 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.16 and
171.19. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Commissioner or on a generic form.
(b)    Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer=s municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipality tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability,
and shall pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of
any overpayment.
(c)    Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after
notification by the Tax Commissioner to file the items required by this
paragraph. (Ord. 24-03. Passed 12-3-03.)

the due date being the fifteenth day of the following month; any other

(b)    Each employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality, as a trustee for
the benefit of the Municipality, and any such tax collected by such employer
from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Municipality, be deemed
a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each employer shall be liable for
the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
(c)    It shall be the responsibility, jointly and severally, of the president
and treasurer of each corporation required to withhold the tax from wages of
its employees under this section to see that all such taxes so withheld are
paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section. In
the event taxes withheld by a corporation from the salaries of its employees
are not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section, the president and treasurer of such corporation shall each be
criminally liable under the provisions of Section
171.21 and

remitted. Such return shall include information concerning each employee from
whom the Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and
social security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation
paid during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee.
(e)    In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall

in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall

1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
(f)    No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the qualifying wages,
commissions, other compensation and other taxable income paid domestic servants
employed exclusively in or about such person=s residence. However, such
domestic servants shall be responsible for the filing and paying their own
returns and taxes.

171.19.
      (2)    Except as hereinafter specified, a declaration of estimated tax to
be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-

in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon

prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer=s entire estimated liability
shall be made. If, upon the filing of the return on or before January 31 or the
date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the difference between

abatement of penalty and interest, the Board of Review may abate such penalty
or interest, or both. (Ord. 33-68. Passed 12-18-68.)
171.16 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
(a)    All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, with any
interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. No additional assessment shall be made after three years from the
time of payment of any tax due or the time the return was filed, whichever is
later hereunder; provided however, there shall be no period of limitation on an
additional assessment in a case of a return that omits gross income in excess
of twenty-five percent of that required to be reported or in the case of filing
a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax or in the case of
failure to file a return. In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of
limitations, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by
the Tax Commissioner shall be extended one year from the time of the final
determination of the Federal tax liability.
(b)    Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three (3) years from the date on which such payment was made or
the return was due, or within three (3) months after final determination of the
federal tax liability, whichever is later.
(c)    After the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding
paid to another municipality, a nonrefundable credit shall be allowed against
tax or withholding erroneously paid or withheld to another municipality equal
to the tax or withholding paid with respect to such income or wages.
      1.    If the tax rate is less than the tax rate paid or withheld on such
income or wages, the credit described in section (c) above shall be calculated
using the tax rate in effect.
      2.    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(d)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, with the
following exception: No interest shall be allowed on any overpayment that is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the complete return is filed, whichever is
later. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no
amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before
the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any
extension of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the
interest prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
(e)    Amounts of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.
(Ord. 24-03. Passed 12-3-03.)

Board shall adopt it own procedural rules and shall keep a record of its
transactions. All hearings by the Board shall be conducted privately unless the
taxpayer requests a public hearing and the provisions of Section
171.13 with reference to the confidential character of information required to
be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be heard before
the Board on appeal.
(c)    The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing within forty-five (45) days
after receiving the request, unless the taxpayer waives a hearing. If the
taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the Board
and may be represented by an attorney at law, certified public accountant or
other representative.
(d)    The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Commissioner's decision
or any part of that decision. The Board shall issue a decision on the appeal
within ninety (90) days after the Board's final hearing on the appeal, and send
notice of its final decision by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the
appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing the decision. The taxpayer or the
tax commissioner may appeal the board's decision as provided in section
5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(e)    Each Board of Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt rules
governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions. Such
records are not public records available for inspection under section 149.43 of
the Ohio Revised Code. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.

other municipality, whichever is less.
   (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions contained in Section
171.16, or any other provisions inconsistent herewith, a claim for refund or
credit under this section shall be made in such a manner as the Tax
Commissioner may by regulation provide. No such claim for refund or credit

a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.
   (e)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the    requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection    with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute

   (g)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.

file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
   (l)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address, and social security number (or federal
identification number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (b)(1)(A) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an
allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the employee in each such
municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which qualifying wages are
allocated under this division shall be the employee's "principal place of work"
with respect to those qualifying wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (b)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (b)   (1)    Subject to divisions (c), (e), and (f) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

one of the following conditions applies:
         (A)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

services commence:
            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (C)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
181.051  of this Chapter.
               (D)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (A)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (B)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (C)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (D)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (E)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal    place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)    Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation    for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (f)    Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (a)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
181.03 (w).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (f)(2) and (g) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
181.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (A)    Separate accounting;
         (B)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (D)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section 
181.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of Section
181.19  of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)    As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)    The employer;
         (B)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)    For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (g) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (A)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (B)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (C)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   For purposes of the application of any net operating loss realized from the
rental of real estate. Said loss is to be applied using separate accounting as
it relates to those properties within a given municipal taxing jurisdiction.
   Common or shared expenses relating to rental real estate shall be allocated
equally among all rental properties
   (f)   (1)    Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081  of this Chapter.
   (g)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (k)(12) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)    When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (i)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (A)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (B)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (C)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section d of this
181.051, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services at that location.
         (D)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (g)(1)(D)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (g)(1)(D)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of this section apply to such apportionment except as otherwise
provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(f)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (g)(2):
         (A)    For the purpose of division (a(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (B)    For the purpose of division (a)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (C)    For the purpose of division (a)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (d) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (b)(1) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to division (d) of this section.

carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (a)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b) (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (b)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (c)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (d)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
181.03 (a) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting    an affiliated group of corporation's"

      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (a) of
181.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,

the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (A)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section

the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (A)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,

chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of

purposes of this section:
         (A)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal

   (c)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.091  of this Chapter.
         (A)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is

         (B)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
181.091  of this Chapter for that year.

qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in any
municipal corporation, shall be allowed a credit in the amount of municipal

municipal income tax has been so paid. Such credit shall be allowed only to the
extent of the tax assessed by this chapter.
      (2)   A resident individual with income from an ownership interest in one
or more pass-through entities, activities of a sole proprietor, or rental
activities, after the deduction of distributable losses from other pass-through
entities or business activities not utilized as a net operating loss carry-
forward in any municipal taxing jurisdiction after January 1, 2018, shall be

in such other municipal corporation only to the extent of the tax assessed by
this chapter.
      (3)   The credit for tax paid by a resident individual for salaries or

individual. Such credit shall be applied only to the extent of the tax assessed
by this chapter.

   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(E)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (a)(2)(B) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)(A) of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)(B) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such
compensation on which the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal
corporations and the denominator of which is the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
181.081  of this Chapter. (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
181.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.

tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      (3)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the
affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for
the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to
properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a
registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
      (4)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person. (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE
   (a)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (c)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2) (A)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)(A)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (B)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)(A) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)(A) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)    For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (c)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of
Granville's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be
the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (b)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (e)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (f)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division
181.094(a),(c), or (e) of this section, the tax administrator shall not make
any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or
before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due
date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
   If a tax administrator violates division
181.094 (f) of this section, the municipal corporation shall reimburse the
taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice
up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   Division (f) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (a) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension under division (c) of this
section.

181.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return, following the provisions of Section
181.063  of this chapter
   (b) (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)    (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (e) of
Section  181.96  of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is
filed beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as
set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in Section
181.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.096 REFUNDS.
   (a)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (b)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18  of this Chapter.
   (c)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (a)(4) of Section
181.10 of this Chapter.

attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

   (b)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (h)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (i)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

      (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (a)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (c)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (d)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e) (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
       (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 15-15. Passed
12-2-15.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (a)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b) (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
 181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.135 DUTIES OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER.

thereof and shall report all moneys so received.
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce payment of all income taxes
owing the Municipality, shall keep accurate records for a minimum of five years

thing pertaining to the collection and payment of taxes and the administration
and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the
re- examination and correction of returns.
   (c)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax Commissioner
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Municipality from the
taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount
of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (d)   Subject to the consent of a majority of the Board of Review or
pursuant to regulation approved by the Board of Review, the Tax Commissioner
shall have the power to compromise any liability imposed by this chapter.
   (e)   Upon the demonstration and documentation of good cause, the Tax
Commissioner shall have the power to compromise penalty and interest
liabilities imposed by this Chapter, consistent with this Chapter.
(Ord. 24-2023. Passed 11-15-23.)
181.14    CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (b)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.15    FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.16    OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15  of this Chapter.
   (e)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (f) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.17    ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by    certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized
under section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b) (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service as
set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery and
service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.18    LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a) (1)   (A)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (B)   The time limit described in division (a)(1)(A) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (A)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
181.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (B)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (d)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
181.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-15. Passed 12-2-15.)

authority of the Municipality has the authority, by Ordinance or Resolution, to

   This section applies to any taxpayer, not an individual, engaged in a
business or profession in the Municipality and electing to be subject to
Sections 718.80 through 718.95 of the Ohio Revised Code, applicable for tax
years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, pursuant to the language enacted
by the Ohio Legislature during the 132nd General Assembly in the form of Am.
Sub House Bill 49, which required municipal corporations to conform to and
adopt the provisions of Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718 in order to retain the
authority to impose, enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (a)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections 718.80 to 718.95 of
the Ohio Revised Code in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of
Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718. Notwithstanding any other provision of Chapter
718, upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of the
municipal income tax for which the taxpayer is liable for the term of the
election;
                (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to
sections 718.80 to 718.95 of the Ohio Revised Code and any applicable provision
of Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)    (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and each municipal corporation in which the
taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
      (2)    (A)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made. A taxpayer may terminate the
initial election within twenty-four months after the election is made by
providing written notice to the tax commissioner. Such notice shall be provided
at least sixty days before the effective date of the termination. Effective on
the termination date, the taxpayer shall make all payments and remittances, and
file all returns, due on or after the termination date to the appropriate
municipal tax administrator. If not terminated, the election shall continue to
apply to each subsequent taxable year until the taxpayer notifies the tax
commissioner of its termination of the election.
         (B)    After the end of the twenty-four-month period in which a
taxpayer may terminate an initial election, a notification of termination shall
be made, on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first
day of the third month of any taxable year.
         (C)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

the municipal corporation shall certify to the tax commissioner the rate of the

                     (B)    If, after the thirty-first day of January of any
year, the electors of the municipal corporation approve an increase in the rate
of the municipal corporation's tax on income that takes effect within that
year, the municipal corporation shall certify to the tax commissioner the new
rate of tax not less than sixty days before the effective date of the increase,
after which effective date the commissioner shall apply the increased rate.
            (2)    The municipal corporation, within ninety days of receiving a
taxpayer's notification of election under division (B) of this section, shall
submit to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner,
the following information regarding the taxpayer:
                    (A)    The amount of any net operating loss that the
taxpayer is entitled to carry forward to a future tax year;
         (B)    The amount of any net operating loss carryforward utilized by
the taxpayer in prior years;
         (C)    Any credits granted by the municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer is entitled, the amount of such credits, whether the credits may be
carried forward to future tax years, and, if the credits may be carried
forward, the duration of any such carryforward;
         (D)    Any overpayments of tax that the taxpayer has elected to carry
forward to a subsequent tax year;
         (E)    Any other information the municipal corporation deems relevant
in order to effectuate the tax commissioner's efficient administration of the
tax on the municipal corporation's behalf.
      (3)    If the municipal corporation fails to timely comply with divisions
(C)(1) and (2) of this section, the tax commissioner shall notify the director
of budget and management, who, upon receiving such notification, shall withhold
from each payment made to the municipal corporation under section 718.83 of the
Ohio Revised Code fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the payment otherwise
due to the municipal corporation under that section. The director shall compute
the withholding on the basis of the tax rate most recently certified to the tax
commissioner until the municipal corporation complies with divisions (C)(1) and
(2) of this section.
   (d)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections 718.80 to
718.95 of the Ohio Revised Code. In addition to any other powers conferred upon
the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (e)    No tax administrator shall utilize sections 718.81 to 718.95 of the
Ohio Revised Code in the administrator's administration of a municipal income
tax, and those sections shall not be applied to any taxpayer that has not made
the election under this section.
   (f)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to make any section of
Chapter 718, other than sections 718.01 and 718.80 to 718.95 of the Ohio
Revised Code, applicable to the tax commissioner's administration of a
municipal income tax or to any taxpayer that has made the election under this
section.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;

the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.

motor vehicle or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of subsection (b) of this section may retrieve any personal
items from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. The owner of the vehicle shall not retrieve any personal items from a
vehicle if it would endanger the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees
to sign a waiver of liability. For purposes of subsection (g)(4) of this
section,
“personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT PERMISSION
OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided herein, whoever violates any provision of
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense; whoever
violates any provision of this section, and has pleaded guilty to or been
convicted within the past twelve months of a violation of any Ohio law or
municipal ordinance regulating the operation of motor vehicles on streets or
highways, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; whoever violates any
provision of this section, and has pleaded guilty to or been convicted within
the past twelve months of more than one violation of any Ohio law or municipal
ordinance regulating the operation of motor vehicles on streets or highways, is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43 .
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

effective the provisions of the Traffic Code and to make and enforce temporary
regulations to cover emergencies or special conditions.
(Ord. 23-98. Passed 11-4-98.)
305.02 TRAFFIC CONTROL.
   In order to avoid those hazards incident to public travel and to protect the
members of the general public while in the use of streets and highways, the
Manager is authorized and directed to establish and mark traffic control areas
as provided herein:
   (a)   Traffic Control Signals. The Manger shall establish and designate
traffic control signal intersections, at which intersections shall be
maintained traffic control signals to regulate traffic. The Manager shall have
all necessary authority to install at such locations any lawful traffic control
signal when in his discretion it is necessary to expedite travel and promote
public safety.
   (b)   One-Way Traffic. The Manager shall determine and designate streets,
parts of streets or special lanes thereon upon which vehicular traffic shall
proceed in one direction only and shall place and maintain appropriate
markings, signs, barriers or other devices to give notice thereof. The Manager
may erect signs temporarily designating lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction, regardless of the center line of the roadway.
   (c)   Stop and Yield Right-of-Way Intersections. The Manager shall establish
and designate stop intersections and yield right-of-way intersections, at which
intersections shall be maintained the appropriate traffic control devices to
regulate traffic and promote public safety. The Manager shall have all
necessary authority to erect, or cause to be erected, appropriate and legible
signs or markers, upon which shall be displayed the word “stop”, at all
intersections designated by the Manager as stop intersections or the words
“yield right-of-way”, at all intersections designated by the Manager as yield
right-of-way intersections.
   (d)   Turns at Intersections. The Manager shall place markers, buttons or
signs within or adjacent to intersections indicating the course to be traveled
by vehicles turning at such intersections or preventing turns at such
intersections.
   (e)   Through Streets. The Manager may designate any street or highway as a
through street or highway and require that all vehicles stop or yield the right
of way as may be required before entering the same; or in residence districts
designate certain streets or highways or portions thereof not to be through
streets or highways despite the erection of stop signs or other official
traffic control devices at intersecting streets.
      (1970 Code §70.11)
   (f)   Through Truck Routes. The Manager shall appropriately mark through
truck routes. (Ord. 23-98. Passed 11-4-98.)
   (g)   Pedestrian Crosswalks. The Manager shall establish and designate by
appropriate devices, marks or lines upon the surface of the roadway, crosswalks
at intersections where in his opinion there is particular danger to pedestrians
crossing the roadway, and at such other places as he may deem necessary in the
interests of public safety.

such kind and character and at such places as he may deem necessary for the
protection of pedestrians.
   (i)   Bus Unloading Zones. The Manager shall mark or cause to be marked, by
appropriate sign or other device, all areas where passengers are loaded or
unloaded in the operation of bus service for the protection of passengers and
pedestrians.
   (j)   Business Loading Zones. The Manager shall establish zones for loading
and unloading of passengers or merchandise, or both, when in his judgment the
operations of business in the area justify and traffic conditions permit.
   (k)   No Parking Zones. To promote safety on the streets, to expedite the
flow of traffic and to regulate parking on the streets, the Manager may
designate areas as “no parking zones” or “limited parking zones” and prescribe
time limitations for parking or prohibit parking upon the streets, alleys and
highways of the Municipality. An appropriate sign shall mark the boundaries of
such zones.
   (l)   Individual Parking Spaces. The Manager shall designate and mark off
individual parking spaces at points or places to be approved by resolution of
Council in certain sections of the downtown area and outlying districts, such
parking spaces to be established along the curb of streets. At each place where
individual parking spaces are so marked off, each vehicle shall be parked
entirely within an individual parking space.
   (m)   Traffic Lanes; Overtaking and Passing Zones. The Manager shall:
      (1)   Mark lanes for traffic on street pavements at such places as he may
deem advisable in the interest of public safety; and
      (2)   Determine those portions of any street where overtaking and passing
other traffic or driving to the left of center, or off-set center, or center
line of the street or roadway would be especially hazardous, and may, by
appropriate signs or markings on the streets or roadway, indicate the beginning
and end of such zones. Such zones shall be so designated by an auxiliary yellow
line placed parallel and to the right of the normal center line or off- set
center line. (1970 Code §70.11)
   (n)   Weather Emergency Parking Ban. Whenever the Manager determines that
snow, ice or other weather conditions have created conditions hazardous to
travel upon the streets of the Municipality, the Manager may declare a weather
emergency and take the following action:
      (1)   Prohibit the parking of any motor vehicle upon any or all of the
streets within the Municipality which prohibition shall become effective upon
the erection of “No Parking” signs on such streets during the existence of the
emergency; and

parked in violation of subsection (n)(1) herein, the Manager may order the
vehicle towed to a vehicle pound where it can be recovered only upon payment of
the towing and storage charges imposed by law.
         (Ord. 5-78. Passed 4-19-78.)
   (o)   Village Walkways. The Manager shall appropriately mark those areas or
ways established by Council as Village walkways within the meaning of Section
301.54 . Such markings shall designate such area or way to be a Village walkway
and that vehicular traffic is prohibited. Village walkways shall be maintained
free of obstruction and accessible for use by emergency vehicles.

the Village to accommodate all requests for space. Conflicting requests will be
analyzed on a case-by-case basis.
   (b)   The permit may be refused or cancelled if:
      (1)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade or procession
including the assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere
with the public convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade, assemblage or procession would require the diversion of
so great a number of police officers to properly police the line of movement,
assembly area and areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police
protection to the Municipality.
      (3)   The parade or procession route of march or assembly areas would
unreasonably interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting
equipment or ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The parade, assemblage or procession would unreasonably interfere
with another parade, assemblage or procession for which a permit has been
issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is false, misleading
or incomplete in any material detail.
      (6)   An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper
conduct of the parade.
   The permit or any other order accompanying it may limit or prescribe
reasonable conditions, including the hours, the places of assembly and of
dispersal, the route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions
thereof which may be used or occupied.
   (c)   During the duration of a permit issued pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof, within any approved assemblage area, the Village may, as is reasonable
and appropriate, designate a specific area or areas within the assemblage area
for use by the public for the purpose of public speaking designed to gather
crowds and for the free discussion of the issues and/or ideas. If such an area
is designated, subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, no
mobile advertising and/or public speaking designed to gather a crowd shall be
permitted within the assemblage area(s), other than at the designated public
speaking area(s).
   Within the designated public speaking area(s), the using or operating of any
loudspeaker, sound amplifier, or other machine or device for the producing or
reproducing of sound which is cast upon the public street or assemblage area
for the purpose of commercial advertising or attraction of the attention of the
public is prohibited. Natural voice only shall be permitted within the
designated public speaking area(s).
   The Village reserves the right to limit or cancel the use of the designated
public speaking area(s) at any time due to compelling unforeseen or operational
circumstances. Every reasonable effort will be made to alleviate the effects of
any such limitation.
   The use of the designated public speaking area(s) shall be by permit of the
Village Manager only. There shall be equal access for all persons or groups to
such permits and a permit shall not be unreasonably denied. A permit under this
section shall be requested no less than two business days prior to the time the
applicant wishes to use the designated public speaking area. For good cause
shown, and solely within the discretion of the Village Manager, a request for a
permit under this section may be submitted less than two business days before
the time the applicant wishes to use the designated public speaking area.
Requests for a permit under this section shall include the name, address and
telephone number of the applicant and the date, time and general nature of the
intended use of the designated public speaking area(s). Should two or more
requests be made for use of the designated public speaking area(s) on the same
date and time, the designated public speaking area(s) will be scheduled on a
first-come, first-served basis. Conflicting requests will be analyzed on a
case-by-case basis.
   The issuance of a permit for use of the designated public speaking area(s)
shall not imply endorsement or approval by the Village of the conduct,
objectives or views of the permit holder.
   (d)   After receiving an initial warning, whoever violates subsection (c)
hereof or the terms of a permit issued thereunder may be guilty of criminal
trespassing, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and/or disorderly conduct, a
misdemeanor of the third degree, and is otherwise subject to any other civil or
criminal penalties provided by State law and the ordinances of the Village. If

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first- time offender
under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that
the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
court under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited
driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first- time offender
under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that
the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the
court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited
driving privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.

endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the
lessee presents proof that the person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become     inadmissible because of
his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY HELD BY LAW ENFORCEMENTAGENCY.
   (a)    Property which has been lost, abandoned, stolen or lawfully seized or
forfeited and is in the custody of the Police Division shall be deposited and

the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)    The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

909.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Village of Granville lies in a valley and foothill landscape. Over time,
many trees have grown or been planted by residents in the community. These
trees, native and imported, provide beauty and protection from summer heat,
increase property values, enhance community pride, preserve wildlife habitat,
reduce air and noise pollution, and reduce soil erosion. Granville has earned
the designation, “Tree City USA”, in recognition of the Village’s unique
stewardship of this vital resource. Accordingly, the Village has determined
that it is necessary for the public health and welfare to conserve tree
resources by protecting trees from unnecessary destruction or removal, and
encouraging the replacement of trees lost to disease, natural hazards, or human
intervention. The Village has also determined that street trees, park trees,
and other trees on public lands contribute to the quality of life in the
community. Chapter
909, Trees, Shrubs and Maintenance, provides for the improvement and
maintenance of the appearance and safety of and the protection, preservation,
and promotion of the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the Village of
Granville. The intent of this chapter is to establish mechanisms and policies
for maintaining public trees in good health, protecting public trees from

909.03 PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSIBLE FOR REMOVAL OF TREE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   The owner of any real estate within the Municipality shall be responsible
for the removal of any trees located on the owner's property, excluding public
right of way. If all or any portion of a tree on an owner's property is deemed
unsafe or otherwise undesirable and overhangs a street or public property, the
Manager or the Manager’s designee may notify the owner in writing to remove
that tree or portion thereof. If the owner does not comply within fifteen days
after receipt of such notice, the Municipality may cause to be removed all, or
the endangering portion of such tree, and assess the cost to the owner.
(Ord. 10-06. Passed 9-20-06.)
909.04 REMOVAL OF TREES WITHIN A PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY; NOTICE; APPEAL.
   (a)    Any tree and/or portion thereof located within the public right of
way shall be caused to be removed by the Municipality after notification to the
abutting and adjacent property owners as provided in this Section that
retention of the tree or portion thereof is deemed by the Municipality to be
unsafe or not in the public interest. Any such removal shall be accomplished by
the Municipality or its agents at the sole expense of the Municipality, and the
Municipality shall determine the method of disposing of the cut wood, which
wood shall be the property of the Municipality.
   (b)   Notification. Unless the Village Manager should decide that immediate
removal of a tree is required to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, the Manager or the Manager’s designee shall notify abutting and
adjacent property owners and/or residents within one hundred (100) feet, as
measured along the street frontage, of the proposed tree removal. Notice to the
abutting property owner(s) shall be given by the Manager or the Manager’s
designee in writing, while notice to the other adjacent property owners and/or
residents shall be through postcards or door-hangings that include appropriate
contacts for obtaining further information.
   (c)   Appeal.  Any property owner or resident to whom notice is provided by
this Section may object in writing to the proposed removal of the tree
identified in the notice and request a hearing before the Village Manager or
the Manager’s designee. The written objection shall be delivered to the Village
Manager within ten (10) days after notice of the proposed removal was first
given by the Village staff.
   (d)   Hearing. The Village Manager or the Manager’s designee shall
reconsider the decision to remove the tree and shall evaluate the information
from the property owners, affected residents, and the Village Service
Department in light of the criteria for removal. The Village staff shall inform
the objecting property owners or residents, either orally or in writing, of the
determination of the Village regarding the tree after such reconsideration and
shall provide the reasons supporting such determination. The Village staff
shall use reasonable efforts and methods to provide notice of such
determination before any removal of the tree, if removal is the final
determination.
(Ord. 10-06. Passed 9-20-06.)
909.05 TREE REMOVAL CRITERIA.
   Loss of trees results in less shade, increased negative impacts due to air
and noise pollution, reduced wildlife habitat, and a less attractive community.
It is the intent of the Village to protect the quality of life in the community
by encouraging the conservation of tree resources. Therefore the following
criteria have been established for evaluating whether a tree in the public
right of way should be removed.
   (a)   The tree is dead.
   (b)   The tree is deemed hazardous, when the hazardous condition cannot be
corrected through pruning or other reasonable arboricultural practices.
   (c)   Persistent and uncontrollable insect, disease or fruiting problems.
   (d)   The frequency and extensiveness of the tree’s maintenance.
   (e)   The proximity and quality of trees near to the one considered for
removal.
   (f)   The extent and frequency of damage the tree is causing to surrounding
infrastructure such as sidewalks, streets, sewers, etc.
   (g)   The feasibility and timeliness in which a replacement tree will be
planted.
   (h)   The amount of space allowable for tree growth.
      (Ord. 10-06. Passed 9-20-06.)
909.06 MANAGER’S PERMISSION TO PLANT, REMOVE, TRIM, TOP OR TREAT TREES.
   (a)    No tree located on public property or on a public right of way shall
be planted, removed, topped, trimmed or treated without first obtaining a
written permit from the Manager or the Manager’s designee. If any tree is
removed, treated or trimmed as provided in this section at the expense of the
abutting property owner, then such wood shall be the property of the abutting
property owner. The property owner shall promptly remove or cause to be removed
all wood from the public property or public right of way based upon
recommendations from the Municipality.
   (b)   The Village Manager may condition the granting of a permit upon the
payment of compensation for the tree removed, as reasonably determined by
Village Manager, and/or the replacement of the tree removed by the planting of
one or more trees of a specie and in a location approved by the Village Manager
upon recommendation by the Tree and Landscape Commission. (Ord. 10-06. Passed
9-20-06.)
909.07 BREAKING OR INJURING TREE IN PUBLIC WAY.
   No person, firm or corporation shall move, remove, destroy, break, cut,
deface, trim or in any way injure or interfere with any tree or shrub growing
in any public way of the Municipality except by written permit of the Manager
or the Manager’s designee. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply
to the removal under the direction of the Municipality of any root, tree, shrub
or part thereof whenever the removal shall be found necessary in the
construction of any sidewalk, sewer, pavement or other public improvement.
(Ord. 10-06. Passed 9-20-06.)
909.08 ATTACHING SIGN OR WIRE PROHIBITED.

(Ord. 07-15. Passed 6-17-15.)
921.04 SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM CAPACITY CHARGES.
   A sanitary sewer system capacity charge shall be made for each new sanitary
sewer connection to any property and shall be paid at the time that the
application for the connection permit is made for the service. This charge
shall be in addition to any other fees or charges made for sanitary sewer
connections and shall be paid to the Village.
   Upon proper proof of hardship, the Village Manager may arrange for a payment
schedule for the foregoing capacity charge.
   (1)   Rates. The Village Superintendent is hereby authorized and directed to
charge a sanitary sewer system capacity fee whenever an application is made for
sanitary sewage collection service from a structure or units whenever such
property is or may be serviced by a sanitary sewer connection line connected to
a tributary directly or indirectly to any public sanitary sewer built by or
under the supervision of the Village. These charges shall be according to the
size of water main tap that supplies water to the structure or units.
   (2)   Capacity Charges.
      (a)    Sanitary sewer system capacity charges for sanitary sewer service
shall be as follows:
Nominal Water Tap Diameter (inches) Capacity Charge

      (b)    Where all or a determined portion of a water service tap is
installed for fire protection, no normal use of sanitary sewers is anticipated
and therefore, no sanitary sewer system capacity charge shall be levied on that
portion used solely for fire protection.
      (c)    In the event a water service tap is enlarged, the sanitary sewer
system capacity charge difference between the two diameter sizes shall be paid
to the Village.
      (d)   Any sanitary sewer system capacity charge, where the water service
tap is larger than those set forth herein, shall be the subject of special
action by Village Council prior to issuance of a connection permit.
      (e)   All sanitary sewer system service connections and lines shall be
approved by the Village Manager.
      (f)   Sanitary sewer system capacity charges shall be deposited into the
Village's Sewer Replacement and Improvement Fund.
         (Ord. 20-2019. Passed 9-4-19.)
921.05 CONTROLLED AND PROHIBITED WASTES.
   (1)    Regulatory Actions. If wastewater containing any substance described
in Section 
921.02  is discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the
Village or to any sewer system tributary thereto, the Superintendent or Village
Manager may take any action necessary to:
      (a)    Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
      (b)    Require those responsible for the proposed discharge to
demonstrate that on site modifications will control, reduce or eliminate the
discharge of substances in conformity with this code. This modification may
include control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
      (c)    Require private, onsite pretreatment including storage facilities
or flow equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable
characteristics or substances so that the discharge will not violate these
rules and regulations.
      (d)   Require the person or corporate entity making, causing or allowing
the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense incurred by the Village for
handling and treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system.
      (e)   Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or
necessary to achieve the purpose of this code. All industrial wastes discharged
to the public sewers by major contributing industries shall, as a minimum, meet
the national pretreatment standards or best practical control technology
currently available for incompatible pollutants as published in the latest
federal regulations.
   (2)    Special conditions.  No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
possible payment, therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment.
Any industrial concern may appeal to Council and any determination made by the
Village Manager as advised by the Village Engineer in the enforcement of this
chapter.
   Each person, whose operation entails the discharge of industrial wastes to a
public sewer, shall prepare and file with the engineer a written statement
setting forth the nature of the operation contemplated or presently carried on,
the amount and source of water required for use, the proposed point of
discharge of such wastes into the wastewater collection systems of the Village,
subject to possible payment therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent
treatment, the estimated amount to be so discharged and a fair statement
setting forth the expected bacterial, physical, chemical and other known
characteristics of such wastes. Within a reasonable time of receipt of such
statement, it shall be the duty of the Village to make an order stating such
minimum restrictions as in the judgment of the engineer may be necessary to
adequately guard against unlawful uses of the Village's wastewater system.
   (3)    Submission of Plans. Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater
flows is required prior to discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment
system, the owner shall submit plans, specifications and other pertinent data
or information, regarding the installation of facilities and equipment relating
to such pretreatment or flow-control facilities, for review and approval of the
Superintendent. Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or such facilities
from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order
of any governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such
pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to
and prior approval of the Superintendent.
   (4)    Grease and oil interceptors. For grease, oil and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Village, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amounts as specified in Section
921.02 (b) or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units.
All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Village and
shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the
captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal
subject to review by the Superintendent. All effluent records must be available
at the Village's request. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials
not performed by the owner, hauling must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms. Upon written notice from the Village, the private sewer
interceptors shall be cleaned.
   (5)    Pretreatment Facilities Operations. If pretreatment of control waste
flows are required, such facilities shall be continuously maintained in good
working order and operated as affectively and efficiently as possible by the
owner or operator at his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements of
these rules, regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (6)    Admission to Property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the
purposes of these rules and regulations, the Superintendent, upon the
presentation of credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at
reasonable times for the purpose of:
      (a)    Reviewing and/or copying any records required to be kept under the
provisions of this chapter,
      (b)   Inspecting any monitoring equipment or method, and
      (c)   Sampling any discharge of wastewater to the treatment works. The
Superintendent may enter upon the property at any hour under emergency
circumstances.
   (7)    Protection From Accidental Discharge. Each industrial user shall
provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes regulated by this code. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or operator
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review and
shall be approved by him before construction of the facility. The industrial
user shall be responsible to modify his facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (8)    Reporting of Accidental Discharge. If, for any reason, a facility
does not comply with or is unable to comply with any prohibition or limitation
in this code, the representatives of the facility responsible for such
discharge shall immediately take corrective actions and notify the
Superintendent so that the treatment system and receiving waters can be
protected. In addition, a written report addressed to the Superintendent
detailing the date, time, cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity,
characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent future
discharges shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within five
days of the occurrence of the non-complying discharge.
(Ord. 07-15. Passed 6-17-15.)
921.06 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER.
   (1)    Discharge Reports.
      (a)   Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic report at
such intervals as designated by the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall
determine whether an industrial use is significant, and may require any other
industrial users discharging or proposing to discharge into the treatment
system to file such periodic reports.
      (b)   The discharge report shall include, but, at the discretion of the
Superintendent shall not be limited to, nature of process, volume, rates of
flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation,
concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information that relates to
the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they
are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the
Superintendent may require information in the form of self-monitoring reports.
   (2)    Records and Monitoring.
      (a)   All industrial users, who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system, shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this code and any applicable state or federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (b)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency and/or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency upon demand.
A summary of such data indicating the industrial user's compliance with this
code shall be prepared as requested and submitted to the Superintendent.
      (c)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install and maintain, at his own cost,
suitable control manholes, access points, and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Superintendent.
      (d)   Wastewater volume determination. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption of
the person except as herein provided in this paragraph.
   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of this water from sources other than a metered, public water
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer, the person
shall install and maintain, at his cost, water meters of a type approved by the
Village and the engineer for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from those other sources. Access to these meters shall be made
available to representatives of the Village at any reasonable time. The
accuracy of the meters shall be verified at the discharger's expense on a
minimum once per year basis or at the request of the Superintendent, by an
independent testing company.
   The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers may install
and maintain, at his cost, metering devices for determining the volume of waste
being discharged to the public sewer from which the industrial waste surcharge
would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type acceptable to the
Village.
   The engineer may require the installation of devices for measuring the
volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records. Any metering device for determining the
volume of waste discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned and
maintained by the person responsible for its discharge. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Village.
      (e)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Superintendent may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public right of way with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such right-of-way and
located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or
parked vehicles.
      (f)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Superintendent's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (3)    Inspection, Sampling, Analysis and Surcharge rates.
      (a)   Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to
Section
921.02 , prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a twenty-four hour period or over a longer or shorter
time span, as determined necessary by the Superintendent to meet the needs of
specific circumstances.
      (b)    Sampling and monitoring. Industrial wastes discharged into the
public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of the wastes. The determination shall be made as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Village, but in no case less than two,
twenty-four hour composite samples per month. The owner shall be responsible
for the collection and testing of the aforementioned samples. Samples shall be
collected in such a manner as to be representative of the composition of the
wastes. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of flow proportionate
automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples. Access to
sampling locations shall be granted to the Village Superintendent or his
authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the same was taken.
      (c)   Analysis of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analysis of
industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current
edition of Standard Methods or the Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and
Waste published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the State Environmental Protection Agency.
However, alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be
used subject to mutual agreement between the Village and the person responsible
for its discharge. Determination of the character and concentration of the
industrial wastes shall be made by the person responsible for the discharge, or
his qualified agent, as approved by the Village The results
of the analyses shall be reported to the Village on a monthly basis on forms
provided by the Village. The Village shall make its own analyses on the wastes
and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges except under
circumstances in the following paragraph.
   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own samples. The
results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Village and the
industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the
latest edition of Standard Methods and the differences negotiated.
      (d)   Industrial Waste Surcharge.
   Industrial waste water into the public sewers as determined by this code
shall be subject to surcharges determined monthly on the basis of the following
formula:
            Pounds of excess parameter per day x $0.253 = Surcharge
   The pounds per day of excess parameter shall be determined by the following
equation: mg/l (milligrams per liter) of excess parameter x8.34x millions
gallons= pounds CBOD5 equals pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per month in
excess of (275) mg/l concentration in the wastewater. S.S. equals pounds of
suspended solids per month in excess of (300) mg/l concentration. NH3-N equals
pounds of ammonia nitrogen per month in excess of (35) mg/l concentration.
   In the foregoing formula $0.253 refers to the total expenditures per pound
of BOD, suspended solids, and nitrogen ammonia respectively, to collect, convey
and treat the wastewater, which shall be determined annually by the Village.
Industrial cost recovery will be established, if an industrial user begins
discharging, in accordance with CFR 35.928 or latest revisions thereto, if
determined applicable.
         (Ord. 07-15. Passed 6-17-15.)
921.07 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (1)   For the purpose of providing for the cost of the management,
maintenance, operation and repair of the sewerage system and sewage pumping,
treatment and disposal works, and for the enlargement or replacement of the
system and works, and for the construction and reconstruction of main and
interceptor sewers and the payment of interest on any debt incurred for the
construction thereof, there is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot or
parcel of land in the Village of Granville on which a building - commercial,
industrial, institutional or residential - is located, and connected to the
Village of Granville sewer system, a sewer service charge as hereinafter
provided. All classes of users shall be levied charges on the same basis as
described hereinafter.
   (2)   (a)    The rates provided below in this subsection shall be effective
for wastewater usage billed beginning with the month of January, 2020. The
sewer service charge shall be calculated on the volume of waste-water
discharged directly or indirectly into the sewer system and shall be measured
by the water used by each sewer user as shown by water meter readings. The
sewer service charge for the Village of Granville shall
consist of a user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement (OM & R) of
six dollars and sixty-five cents ($6.65) per thousand gallons. If the total
sewage (as measured by water meter readings) discharged in any one (1) month
period is less than one thousand (1000) gallons, there shall be a minimum
charge of six dollars and sixty-five cents ($6.65). Such minimum charge shall
be for OM&R in the amount of six dollars and sixty-five cents ($6.65). Theses
rates will increase for wastewater usage billed in January of each year in
2021, 2022, and 2023 as outlined in subsections (3) and (4) below.
      (b)    The sewer service system charge will be audited annually by the
Village with the charges being adjusted upwards or downwards in order to assure
that the system is and will continue to be self-sufficient and that sufficient
revenue is being generated from each user class in the proper proportions. No
free service shall be provided in this service charge system. Each user will be
notified by the Village, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill,
of the rates for that year and that portion of the service charges which are
attributable to the user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement of
the system. In addition, rates will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly to
compensate users of each class for any overages and underages accumulated
during the previous rate period. The sewer service charge herein assessed shall
be in addition to the charge made for water used.
      (c)    Where a private supply is used, the sewer service charge may be
calculated by requiring the property owner to meter the private water supply,
such metering to be at the property owner's expense and such measurement to be
used in the same manner as a public water meter in determining the charge. The
Village may, at its option, in lieu of such metering, apply a sewer service
charge of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per month to such premises. Each
resident, institution, commercial or industrial establishment shall be subject
to a separate sewer service charge even though such establishment may be served
by a sewer connection common to other premises. If it be found by the citizen
that the water or waste measured or metered for any customer is greater than
that actually being discharged directly or indirectly into the sewage system,
the Village may modify and adjust such volume in accordance with the facts and
with justice and equity, but no charge less than the minimum shall be made for
any customer subject to the sewer service charge.
      (d)    Where a private water supply is used and/or the user desires to
meter his water use or sewage flow, the owner shall incur all expenses related
to the installation of said meter. Prior to installation of the meter, the type
of equipment installed and its location must be approved by the Village. Prior
to placing said meter into use after installation, the Village shall inspect
and approve or disapprove the meter installation. Any modifications required by
the Village shall be made at the user's expense and prior to the meter's use.
The meter shall be located in a suitable location that will accommodate
readings by Village personnel. Tampering with the meter by the user to cause
inaccurate readings shall make the user subject to the penalty provisions of
Section
921.99 .
   (3)   The rates provided in Section (2)(a) above shall be further amended
for wastewater usage billed during the month of January, 2021. The sewer
service charge shall be calculated on the volume of waste-water discharged
directly or indirectly into the sewer system and shall be measured by the water
used by each sewer user as shown by water meter readings. The sewer service
charge for the Village of Granville shall consist of a user charge for
operation, maintenance and replacement (OM & R) of seven dollars and nineteen
cents ($7.19) per thousand gallons. If the total sewage (as measured by water
meter readings) discharged in any one (1) month period is less than one
thousand (1000) gallons, there shall be a minimum charge of seven dollars and
nineteen cents ($7.19). Such minimum charge shall be for OM&R in the amount of
seven dollars and nineteen cents ($7.19).
   (4)   The wastewater rates provided in subsection (3) above shall be further
amended in the years 2022 and 2023 with a two percent (2%) increase each year.
Therefore, beginning with the wastewater usage billed during the month of
January 2022, the rate will increase to seven dollars and thirty-three cents
($7.33) per 1,000 gallons and beginning with the wastewater usage billed during
the month of January 2023 the rate will increase to seven dollars and forty-
seven ($7.47) per 1,000 gallons. These rates will be calculated on the volume
of wastewater discharged directly or indirectly into the sewer system and shall
be measured by the water used by each sewer user as shown by water meter
readings. If the total sewage (as measured by water meter readings) discharged
in any one (1) month period is less than one thousand gallons, there shall be a
minimum charge of 1,000 gallons. Such minimum charge shall be for OM&R. (Ord.
27-2019. Passed 11-6-19.)
921.08 APPLICABILITY OF SEWER RENTAL CHARGE.
   Where a sewer is available, it will be presumed that the waste from the
premises either will be discharged directly or indirectly into the sewerage
system and the property will be subject to the current sewer rental charges.
   Where premises are not served directly or indirectly by the sewerage system
and should be exempt from the sewer rental charge, it will be the
responsibility of the property owner or other interested party to notify the
Village of the claim for exemption. All lots, lands, buildings or premises
owned by the Village and within the Village shall be subject to the sewer
rental charge as set forth herein.
(Ord. 07-15. Passed 6-17-15.)
921.09 LIEN OF SEWER RENTAL.
   The owner of each lot, land or premise connected to the sanitary or combined
sewer system in the Village or having such connection available shall, as well
as the lessee of such lot, land or premise, be liable to the Village for any
charge or rental levied by this chapter. All charges for rentals shall be

925.01 WATER SUPPLY, OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL
   (a)    The public water supply system of the Village of Granville, including
all wells, pumping and treatment equipment, storage tanks, water mains, valves,
fire hydrants, meters and services, is owned and operated by the Village of
Granville under the control of the Village Manager and his duly authorized
agents or Village employees. Such control shall include all piping from the
municipal mains to the curb box or to where the municipal water is finally
discharged freely at atmospheric pressure.
   (b)    No person, firm or corporation shall make or maintain a physical
connection between the Village's public water system and any other sources of
water or other liquid. No spigot or outlet connected to the Village's water
system shall also be physically connected to a sewer or drain, nor shall such
spigot or outlet be below a free overflow or submerged. An air gap separation
must be present. If such a connection is made, it shall be considered as a
cross connection, and if not removed, it shall be just reason for discontinuing
service.
   (c)    The Village does not guarantee consumers full volume, fixed pressure,
fixed chemical quality or an effective continuous supply of water, such matters
being subject to the varying conditions that may affect the operation and
maintenance of the mains, services, pumping stations, reservoirs and other
parts of the water system. No claim shall be considered for damages of any
nature alleged to have arisen from changes in pressure, volume, chemical
quality or any other fluctuations or interruption of water service. The
Village, however, in case of accident or necessity, which requires the
interruption of the supply, endeavors to notify its customers in advance. (Ord.
06-14. Passed 8-20-14.)
925.02 TAMPERING WITH WATER SYSTEM AND/OR VIOLATION OF WATER SYSTEM RULES.
   (a)    No person shall tamper with or remove any meter seal or insert a
meter bypass without the permission of the Manager or his authorized agents.
   (b)    No person shall operate, open or otherwise tamper with any valve,
curb stop or other device, after the same has been closed for violation of any
rule or regulation of the Village; or unlawfully secure a supply of water
through such valve, curb stop or other device after the same has been closed
for the violation of any rule or regulation of the Village or in any way take
water for private use unlawfully.
   (c)    No person shall put filth, animal matter, drugs, chips, shavings or
any other non-potable substance into any municipal potable water reservoir,
bathe or swim therein.   
   (d)    The penalties herein are in addition to the penalties provided by the
criminal laws of Granville and the state and making payment herein shall not in
any way relieve any person from criminal prosecution. (Ord. 06-14. Passed 8-20-
14.)
925.03 WATER MAIN CLASSIFICATION.
   (a)   Distribution Main - any water main or main extension intended
primarily to serve properties or premises abutting the street, road or way in
which it is laid.
   (b)    Trunk Main - any water main not less than eight inches in diameter
intended primarily to carry water for the supply of distribution mains
   (c)   Service Line - a pipe tapped into a water main for the purpose of
serving private premises. Fire line - non-potable, static pressure line
constructed for fire suppression only.
   (d)   Installation of all mains and lines shall be in accordance with
Village Construction Material Specifications as amended.
(Ord. 06-14. Passed 8-20-14.)
925.04 WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS.
   Except as specifically provided by ordinance of Council, all construction of
water main extensions and water service branches in streets and ways, not
already supplied with water, shall be in accordance with one of the plans set
forth herein:
   (a)   Plan No. 1: Payment of Entire Cost in Advance. Any one or more
property owners may request the Manager to determine the feasibility and the
estimated cost of the construction of a proposed water extension to serve the
premises. If the Manager approves the proposed extension and determine the
estimated construction cost, such property owners may deposit with the
Municipality a sum equal to such estimated cost and the Village shall thereupon
proceed with the subject construction. Any surplus in the deposit over and
above the construction cost shall be refunded to the owner or their agent.
Should the construction cost exceed the deposit amount the owner or owners
shall pay this excess amount and no water service shall be rendered from the
extension until the cost is paid in full.
   (b)   Plan No. 2: Construction by Owner. The Village may permit or require
the owner or owners to arrange for the laying of water main extensions by
private contract to be under the supervision of the Village. In any such case,
the Village shall require a deposit in the sum of three percent (3%) of the
total estimated cost as a guarantee against defective workmanship or materials.
Such deposit, less any sums expended by the Village for repair or replacement
of defective work or materials, shall be refunded one year after the water main
extension has been placed in service. No other refund or payment shall be made.
Materials and plans used for water main extension must be approved by the
Village.
   (c)   Plan No. 3: Assessment in Accordance with Ohio Revised Code.  The
owners of property to be served by a proposed water main extension may petition
for, or Council may authorize, the construction of such extension and the
assessment of the cost thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (d)   Plan No. 4: Construction Authorized by the Village. If, in the opinion
of the Manager, it is necessary to extend a water main through an area not
suitable for immediate development or an area the ownership of which is such as
to make Plans 1, 2 and 3 undesirable, the Manager may then authorize
construction of such main and charge a front foot rate for tapping the same in
addition to the regular service branch charge, as provided in this chapter. The
front foot rate shall be the same for all premises involved and shall be
sufficient to ultimately return the entire cost to the Municipality except that
in the case of a trunk main,
the front foot rate shall only return to the Municipality such an amount as
would have constructed a main of sufficient size to serve the area with water
and fire protection. The installation of a service line to serve each lot with
water shall be required for any of the above water main extension plans.
   (e)   Payment for water improvements must be made to the Village before
gaining access to the water system.
      (Ord. 06-14. Passed 8-20-14.)
925.05 GENERAL RULES FOR WATER LINE EXTENSIONS.
   (a)    No extension of a water main shall be approved for less than the
entire right-of-way frontage of the property served and the necessary length
from the existing main to that frontage.
   (b)    Plans for all water system main construction shall be drawn by a
registered engineer.
   (c)    All water mains shall be installed to plan and profile in accordance
with standard specifications of the Village and be approved by the Manager on
advice of the consulting engineer and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (d)    The Village and consulting engineer shall in all cases specify the
size and location of the water main to be installed as well as the number and
location of valves, fire hydrants or other appurtenances thereto.
   (e)    The Manager, on the advice of the consulting engineer, may designate
any water main as a trunk main. Where mains are to be installed to serve both
trunk and distribution requirements, the installation cost shall be divided
between the Municipality and the developers/owners of the abutting property,
with the owners paying the cost of constructing a line of sufficient size to
serve the area with water and fire protection (a minimum of eight inches).
Where a water main extension is required by the Municipality to be installed
larger than eight inches in nominal diameter, the Municipality shall pay the
difference in the cost of the pipe, fittings and valves between the
installation of an eight inch water main and the water main installed.
   (f)    All water mains extended or installed under these rules and
regulations shall, upon being supplied with water, become the sole property of
the Municipality and all maintenance, repair costs and charges shall be assumed
by the Village.
(Ord. 06-14. Passed 8-20-14.)
              
925.06 PERMITS.
   (a)    Any property owner, firm, corporation or contractor desiring a new or
enhanced service line to the municipal water mains shall make application in
person or by agent at the municipal office for such connection and sign a
contract for water service. Total charges for such permit, including capacity
fees, tap fees, etc., shall be paid at the time of application. The application
for a permit shall be reviewed by the Manager and Utilities Director.
Notification of approval or disapproval shall be given within seven (7) working
days after receipt of the application.
   (b)    A permit for a water service line to serve a property or premises
shall be issued only after a County Health Department plumbing permit has been
issued.
   (c)    Contractors and tradesmen for building construction shall pay a
monthly flat rate water charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) per month or fraction
of month for each unit of residential construction. Such charge shall begin on
the date that water is first turned on at the building site and shall continue
until the Village is notified that the final plumbing inspection has been made
by the County Health Department and the premises are ready for water meter
installation.
   (d)    No permit shall be issued for a service line to serve any premises
unless such premises abut an adequate sized main installed across the entire
frontage to be served. A permit for a service line may be refused if, in the
judgment of the Village, the water main is of insufficient size to supply the
additional water demand and maintain satisfactory service to established
consumers.
   (e)    No person shall make any extensions or alterations for water service
to any premises until a written permit from the Manager's office for each
separate job is first obtained. (Ord. 06-14. Passed 8-20-14.)

soon as possible. If such a break or leak occurs back of the curb box at any
place upon the premises supplied, the property owner shall have the break or
leak repaired at the owner's expense. Failure to make repairs may result in
water being turned off and the property owner charged for the estimated
quantity of water lost.
   (g)   Any person, firm, corporation or water user may discontinue water
service by proper notice to the Municipal office, be relieved of their
responsibility when the water is turned off at the curb box and the account
cleared on the records of the Municipality.
   (h)   Any property owner or his duly authorized agent desiring water service
from an existing service line must sign for such service at the municipal
office before such service shall be provided. Water service shall be refused an
applicant or premises owing for previous service or assessments.
   (i)   Backflow prevention and cross-connection control is required by the
Village to ensure water quality. Rules 3745-95-01 through 3745-95-08 of the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Rules and Regulations for Public Water
Systems are in effect, as were effective November 26, 1980, except that
"Director," as defined in Rule 3745-95-01(W) means the Utilities Director of

1117.01 EVALUATION OF PLANS.
   The Subdivision and Development Regulations, principles, standards and
requirements set forth herein shall be applied by the Planning Commission in
evaluating the proposed subdivision plans submitted for their consideration.
However, if physical conditions interfere, the Planning Commission may
recommend deviation from the established requirement so as to carry out the
overall intent of these standards. (Ord. 21-95. Passed 8-2-95.)
1117.02 STREETS AND HIGHWAYS.
   (a)   Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
usable lots, reasonable grades, a minimum of topographical or physical
alterations and multiple access.
   (b)   Local streets shall be so laid out as to discourage their use by
through traffic. Further, the arrangement of streets shall provide for the
continuation of appropriate projection of the streets to serve the adjacent
lands wherever topographic and other physical conditions permit.
   (c)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
highway of primary classification, the Planning Commission may require a
frontage road, nonaccess reservation along the rear of the property contiguous
to such highway or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to separate local and through traffic.
   (d)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way or
limited access highway right of way the Planning Commission may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right of way at a
distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such
distances shall also be determined with regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future separations.
   (e)   Buffer strips or lots intended to restrict access from adjacent
private or public areas shall be prohibited.
   (f)   Double-frontage lots are prohibited, unless the street to the rear is
a service road or alley. The Planning Commission may determine double-frontage
lots or reverse-frontage lots are necessary to meet the objectives of Access
Management, Section
1117.03.
   (g)   A tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets.
   (h)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as near as possible at
right angles.
   (i)   Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as stubs to permit further
street extensions into adjoining undeveloped tracts or when designed as cul-de-
sacs.
   (j)   All street rights of way shall not be less than the width specified as
follows:
 
STREET TYPE MINIMUM WIDTH (feet)
Arterial    70
Collector   60
Local       60
Cul-de-sac  60
Service     50
   (k)   Street grades shall conform to the following specifications:
 
STREET TYPE MAXIMUM GRADE (percent)
Arterial    8
Collector   10
Local       10
Cul-de-sac  10
Service     10
   The minimum grade for collector or local streets shall be one-half (½) of
one (1) percent.

all required improvements in one of the following ways:
      (1)   The subdivider/developer shall, prior to construction of the
improvements, seek preliminary approval by the Planning Commission. The
subdivider/developer may construct all improvements. Upon completion of such
improvements and their acceptance by the Municipal Engineer and Council, the
subdivider/developer may request approval by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The subdivider/developer may furnish a surety bond equal to the
estimated cost of construction of all the improvements. The estimate shall be
furnished by the Municipal Engineer.
      (3)   The subdivider/developer may make a cash deposit with the
legislative authority in an amount equal to the estimated cost of improvements.
The performance bond or cash deposit shall run to the Municipality and shall
provide that the subdivider/developer, his/her heirs, successors and assigns,
their agent or servants, shall comply with all applicable terms, conditions,
provisions and requirements. Before such bond is accepted it shall be approved
by the Municipal Engineer and Council.
      (4)   The subdivider/developer may furnish the Municipality with an
irrevocable letter of credit or such other credit instrument as may be approved
by Council in an amount equal to the estimated cost of construction of all
improvements. Any such "credit", "letter of credit", "documentary draft",
"documentary demand of payment" or other approved engagement shall designate
the Municipality as "beneficiary" and shall be in such form and upon such
condition as may be established by Council.
   (b)   Extension of Time. The construction of all improvements for which a
surety bond or cash deposit had been provided by the subdivider/developer shall
be completed within one (1) year after the subdivision has received final
approval. If the subdivider/developer fails to complete such improvements
within the prescribed time, he/she must show cause why the bond or the cash
payment should not be forfeited. The Manager may, if reasonable cause is shown,
grant an extension of time not to exceed six (6) months, at the end of which
time if the improvements still remain incomplete, the Manager may request
Council to initiate legal action to enforce compliance.
   (c)   Inspections. During the construction of the subdivision improvements,
periodic inspections shall be made by the Municipality. The subdivider/
developer shall notify the proper administrative officer when each phase of an
improvement is ready for inspection. When acceptable evidence had been received
by the Manager that all improvements have been adequately constructed, the
Manager may recommend that the surety bond or cash deposit be released.
   (d)   As-Built Drawings. Improvements shall be installed as shown in the
plans. “As-built” drawings shall be provided by the subdivider/developer on
mylar. “As-built” drawings shall include locations, dimensions and
specifications which differ from originally approved plans.
   (e)   One-Year Warranty Period. There shall be a one-year warranty period
for all improvements made as part of the subdivision/development. All
improvements must be completed and approved by the Municipality before the
warranty period shall begin. In no event shall the Warranty Period commence
until As-Built drawings have been submitted and approved by the Municipality.
The final course of asphalt, if applicable, shall be permitted to be installed
at the end of the one-year warranty period.
(Ord. 21-95. Passed 8-2-95.)

   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements. Wherever this Ordinance
imposes a greater restriction than is imposed or required by other provisions
of law or by other rules or regulations or ordinances, the provisions of this
Ordinance shall govern. The Zoning Ordinance is intended to be one regulatory
"tool" by which the Comprehensive Plan of the Village of Granville is
implemented. Interpretive background to this Ordinance may therefore be found
within that Plan.
1133.02 VALIDITY AND REPEAL.
   (a)   Validity. This Zoning Ordinance and the various chapters, sections and
paragraphs thereof are hereby declared to be severable. If any article,
chapter, section, subsection, paragraph, sentence or phrase of this Ordinance
is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction,
the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.

directed to certify to the passage of this Ordinance. This Ordinance shall be
in effect and be in force from and after its passage, approval and publication.

Ordinance, the provisions contained herein shall be held to be minimum
requirements, adopted for the promotion of public health, morals, safety and
the general welfare. In case of any conflict between this Ordinance, or any
part thereof, and the whole or part of any existing or future ordinance of the
Village, or the whole or part of any existing or future private covenants or
deeds, the most restrictive shall, in all cases, apply.
1133.03 REMEDIES AGAINST UNLAWFUL DECISIONS AND ORDERS.
   (a)   In addition to other remedies provided by law, the Village may enjoin
or take any other action against any administrative decision or order including
an appeal under Sections
1139.06  or
1141.06  of the Zoning Code, made or issued under this Zoning Ordinance by
Council, the Village Manager, Board of Building and Zoning Appeals, Planning
Commission, Zoning Inspector, or other officer, employee, or entity of the
Village on grounds that the decision or order is unlawful, arbitrary,
unreasonable, not supported by a preponderance of evidence, or an abuse of
corporate power, or was procured by misrepresentation, fraud, or corruption.
The Village may also attack or avoid any such decision or order on such grounds
in any action brought against it or any of its officers, employees, or other
entities.
   (b)   Pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, Council may review any such
administrative decision or order upon written request of the Village Manager,
Law Director, or Zoning Inspector, or upon its own initiative. The decision to
conduct a review shall be made by resolution of Council. A resolution shall
indicate the basis for the review and refer to the pertinent legal provisions.
Council shall conduct the review as prescribed in Section
1137.01  of this Zoning Ordinance.
   
   (c)   Except for cases involving misrepresentation, fraud or corruption, no
decision or order shall be reversed, revoked, or modified under subsections (a)
or (b) hereof after there has been a substantial change of position,
substantial expenditure, or a significant incurrence of obligations in
justifiable reliance on the decision or order.
   (d)   This section confers authority to attack and avoid administrative
decisions as set forth in Willoughby Hills vs. C.C. Bar's Sahara, Inc. (1992),
64 Ohio St. 3d 24, and State ex rel. Broadway Petroleum Corp. vs Elyria (1969),

1145.01 PURPOSE.
   Certain uses more intensely affect the surrounding area in which they are
located than permitted uses in the same zoning district, and yet if properly
controlled and regulated, these uses can be compatible within the zoning
district. To provide this necessary control, such uses shall be designated as
conditional uses and allowable only upon review and approval by the Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals as exceptions to the strict application of this
Zoning Ordinance. Because of the uniqueness or special nature of a conditional
use with respect to location, design, size and method of operation, each such
use that comes before the review of the Board shall be considered individually.
1145.02 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application Fee. The applicant shall pay a fee sufficient to cover
costs of administration, advertising, review, publishing and reporting of the
case, as established by the current ordinance.
   (b)   Contents of Application. The application must include the following:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s); names and
signatures of property owner(s) or designee.
      (2)   The address and legal description of the property in question.
      (3)   Description of existing uses of all parts of the lot or property;
proposed conditional use or other change and the present zoning district in
which the current use is located; the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance which
are applicable.
      (4)   A statement of the relationship of the proposed use to adjacent
land use in terms of traffic, parking, noise and other nuisances and general
compatibility.
      (5)   A statement responding to the criteria for approval of such
application.
      (6)   A list of property owners within 200 feet of the property on which
the conditional use is to be considered, taken from a current County Auditor
tax list or the County Treasurer's mailing list.
      (7)   Eight copies of the plot plan showing:
         i.   Boundaries and dimensions of the lot and the size and location of
all proposed or existing structures. The application shall also include a map
which shows all adjacent properties, including zones, with the approximate
location of existing structures.
         ii.   Traffic access, traffic circulation, existing and proposed
utilities, parking, tree locations, landscaping, signs, refuse and service
areas and other such information relevant to the proposed use.
         iii.   The nature of any special conditions or circumstances.
      (8)   Such additional information as may be required by this Zoning
Ordinance or requested by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals to review
the application.
1145.03 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall make the following
determinations with respect to an application for a conditional use permit:
   (a)   The proposed use is a conditional use within the zoning district and
the applicable
      development standards of this Zoning Ordinance are met.
   (b)   The proposed use is in accordance with all current land use and
transportation plans for the area and is compatible with any existing land use
on the same parcel.
   (c)   The proposed use will not create an undue burden on public facilities
and services such as streets, utilities, schools and refuse disposal.
   (d)   The proposed use will not be detrimental or disturbing to existing
neighboring uses, and will not entail a use, structure or condition of
operation that constitutes a nuisance or hazard to any persons or property.
   (e)   The proposed use will not significantly diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding areas.
      (Ord. 15-08. Passed 1-7-09.)
1145.04 GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Please refer to Chapter
1139  for the review procedure.
   (b)   Issuance of Conditional Use Permit. Upon approval of the Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals, and with such conditions attached by the Board as
may be necessary to secure the objectives of this Zoning Ordinance, to protect
the character of the surrounding properties and neighborhood affected by the
proposed use, and to mitigate the impact of the use, the Zoning Inspector shall
issue a conditional use permit to the applicant. Such permit shall authorize
one particular conditional use and such permit shall automatically expire if,
for any reason, the conditional use shall not be commenced within one (1) year
or, if construction or renovation is included as part of such conditional use,
such construction or renovation is not begun within two years. Such permit
shall expire if a conditional use is discontinued for more than two years.

Board may include, but shall not be limited to, the following requirements or
conditions;
      (1)   Regulation of locations, setbacks, yard requirements, and
configurations of structures and of uses of interior and exterior space,
including a condition that any such requirements be greater than the minimum
regulations required by this Zoning Code;
      (2)   Off-street parking requirements be greater than the minimum
required by this Zoning Ordinance or other applicable Ordinances, including
conditions relating to access points and traffic management provisions, or
other provisions that impact vehicular and pedestrian access, and the locations
and design of parking facilities, and that parking areas and other parts of the
lot be screened from adjoining lots or from the street by walls, fences, trees,
shrubs or other planting, or other devices;
      (3)   Exterior features or the appearance of any structure be modified,
the structures be cleaned and painted, and the direction and intensity of
outdoor lighting or signs be changed, or other requirements relating to
maintenance of the site, the structures thereon, and landscaping;
      (4)   The size, number of occupants, method and times of operation, and
extent of the facilities be limited;
      (5)   Actions be taken to control or eliminate smoke, dust, radiation,
vibration, gas, noise, or odor.
   (d)   Appeals. Appeals from the decisions of the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals may be had as provided in Chapter
1139 .

1147.01 PURPOSE.
   The issuance of a variance to allow deviation from the strict interpretation
of the applicable regulations contained in this Zoning Ordinance shall, unless
otherwise established, be under the power of the Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals. In no case shall the granting of a variance allow a use not permitted
under district regulations nor shall the nonconforming use of land or
structures be considered as grounds for issuance of a variance.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 4-4-01.)
1147.02 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application To Be Made. Written application for a variance shall be
made to the Village Manager or his/her designee who shall transmit the
application to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals.

costs of administration, advertising, review, publishing and reporting of the
case, as established by current ordinance.

or the County Treasurer’s mailing list.
      (6)   Eight copies of the plot plan showing:
         A.   Boundaries and dimensions of the lot and the size and location of
all proposed and existing structures. The application shall also include a map
that shows all adjacent properties, including zones, with the approximate
location of existing structures.

Ordinance or requested by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals to review
the application. (Ord. 07-01. Passed 4-4-01.)
1147.03 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
   The following considerations shall be examined in the review and the public
hearing of an application for variance:
   (a)   That special circumstances or conditions exist which are peculiar to
the land or structure(s) involved and which are not applicable to other lands
or structures in the same zoning districts.
   (b)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would result in practical difficulties for the owner of the property.
The factors to be considered by the Board in making this determination are:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial.
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered, or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance.
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage).
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction.
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance.
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be required to be observed and substantial justice done by granting the
variance.
   (c)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
   (d)   That the granting of the variance will in no other manner adversely
affect the health, safety and general welfare of the persons residing or
working within the vicinity of the proposed variance, and not diminish or
impair established property values within the surrounding areas, and not impair
an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent properties, and not
unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets.
   (e)   In granting a variance, the board may impose any requirements or
conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the
proposed uses or buildings or structures as the board deems necessary to carry
out the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code, and to satisfy the other
conditions set forth in subsection (d) hereof. (Ord. 15-08. Passed 1-7-09.)

   (a)   Please refer to Chapter
1139  of the Codified Ordinances for the review procedure.
   (b)   Issuance of Zoning Permit. If the application for a variance is
approved, the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall, after specifying such
conditions as it may deem necessary, direct the Village Manager or his/her
designee to issue a Zoning Permit to the applicant.

Appeals may be had as provided in Chapter

1159.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The old village section of Granville is a unique area comprised of
residences, neighborhood businesses serving the personal, family and household
needs of residents, and public and semipublic land uses. These uses are
contained in structures representing a variety of architectural styles which
reflect the era in which most of the village section was built. Many of these
buildings are now included on the National Register of Historic Buildings. The
goal of regulation in the Village District is to insure that any land use
changes which occur within the District are harmonious and compatible with the
appearance and the character of adjacent land uses and that such changes
enhance the Village District.
   (b)   Uses in the Village District are oriented toward the pedestrian rather
than the automobile. Amenities such as small park areas, benches and special
sidewalk treatments are encouraged. Requirements for parking and setback may be
eased when it advances the overall purpose of the Village District. The
preservation of existing structures which have historical and architectural
significance as well as the integration of new and renovated structures with
the character and appearance of existing structures in the Village District is
emphasized.
   (c)   The Village District is comprised of four subdistricts: the Village
Residential District (VRD), the Village Business District (VBD), the Village
Square District (VSD) and the Village Institutional District (VID).

1161.01 PURPOSE AND BOUNDARIES.
   The Village of Granville was first settled in 1805. Buildings in the
community reflect the architectural styles of every period from the early
nineteenth century to the present and demonstrate the Village's ties to the
past. The Village District itself has become a source of pride, enjoyment and
prosperity to the residents of the entire area. It attracts many visitors each
year. In the interest of promoting and protecting the public health, safety,
general welfare and prosperity, there is hereby established the Architectural
Review Overlay District which shall have the boundaries as shown on the
Official Zoning Map. The District may be expanded by amendment to this chapter.
(Ord. 03-2023. Passed 1-18-23.)
1161.02 ZONING PERMITS REQUIRED.
   The purpose of the Architectural Review Overlay District is to preserve and
encourage good architectural styles within the Village, reflecting the distinct
phases of the Village's history. Therefore, in addition to the other
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, all applications for Zoning Permits in
the Architectural Review Overlay District shall be subject to the following
guidelines to determine if the proposed project
   (a)   Is stylistically compatible with other new, renovated and old
structures in the Village District.
   (b)   Contributes to the improvement and upgrading of the historical
character of the Village District.
   (c)   Contributes to the continuing vitality of the District.
   (d)   Protects and enhances examples of the physical surroundings in which
past generations lived.
      (Ord. 03-2023. Passed 1-18-23.)
1161.03 PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   Applications shall be subject to Planning Commission review if,
      (1)   The application proposes changes of any type to a contributing
structure as outlined in the Granville Multiple Resources Area;
      (2)   The application proposes addition, expansion, renovation, or
remodeling of an existing structure that would add an additional 20% of
enclosed square footage to the existing structure;
      (3)   The application proposes changes to the architectural style of the
structure;
      (4)   The application proposes construction of an accessory structure of
144 square feet or greater; or
      (5)   The application proposes construction of a new primary structure.
   (b)   Those applications not specifically enumerated in section (a) above
shall be considered administrative review and approval items. Applications
subject to administrative review shall abide by the guidelines for zoning
permits as outlined in Chapter
1137 of this Code.
   (c)   During the course of administrative review and approval under
subsection (b) above, and if deemed appropriate by the Planning and Development
Director, an application may be forwarded to Planning Commission for their
review.
(Ord. 03-2023. Passed 1-18-23.)
1161.04 CONTENTS OF THE APPLICATION.
   (a)    The application shall contain, in addition to the information
required by Chapter
1159:
      (1)   Elevation showing the proposed changes.
      (2)   A description of or a sample of materials to be used in the
proposed project.
      (3)   Where the proposal is for renovation or modification of an existing
structure, the original date of construction of the building, if known.
      (4)   Site plan, including massing and relationships to other structures
on the block face.
      (5)   Any other reasonable items deemed necessary by the Planning &
Development Department for the purpose of review and approval of the
application
   (b)   The applicant may submit photographs, sketches or other material to
illustrate the proposed project. The Planning Commission, or the Planning &
Development Director, may request such additional information as is deemed
necessary to review the application for compliance with this chapter.
   (c)   If the application is submitted in conjunction with an application for
new construction, a change in use, or rezoning, the plan review shall occur
simultaneously with the architectural review. All applications for
architectural review shall be acted upon within thirty days (unless waived by
the applicant) from the date the application was received by the Planning &
Development Department. The application may be approved as submitted, may be
conditionally approved, or may be rejected. (Ord. 03-2023. Passed 1-18-23.)
1161.05 ADVISORS.
   The Planning Commission may retain an architect/advisor who need not be a
resident of the Village, with approval of the Village Council. (Ord. 03-2023.
Passed 1-18-23.)
1161.06 STANDARDS AND CRITERIA.
   In reviewing an application, the Planning Commission shall determine, based
on submitted materials, whether the proposed architecture follows or
exemplifies any one or a combination of the following architectural styles:
 
         Colonial            Greek Revival
         Dutch Colonial         Victorian
         French Colonial         Italianate
         Georgian            Second Empire
         Federal/Adamesque         Chateauesque
         Jeffersonian/Roman Revival      Homestead
         Richardsonian Romanesque      Queen Anne
         American Foursquare         Craftsman
         Tudor               Bungalow
   These styles are considered consistent with existing architecture in the
Village, and depict the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan. So also must the
Commission consider the "tout ensemble," or the totality of an architecturally
or historically unique area.
   In reviewing an application, the Planning Commission shall also consider the
following:
   (a)   Height. The height of the building shall be measured at the ridge line
or the parapet. All new construction should be within ten percent (10%) of the
average height of the existing structures on the block face, unless the
structures are of a potential landmark character, or the Planning Commission
finds that it is not in the best interest of the community that a common height
be maintained.
   (b)   Building Massing. In evaluating building massing, such characteristics
as the building width, height, surrounding setbacks and style shall be
considered in relationship to all other structures on the block face. This
relationship between buildings should allow for consistency of style, size and
density in each given neighborhood area.
   (c)   Roof Shape. Roof shape is particularly significant in low buildings or
buildings which will be seen from a distance or from above. Roof forms and
materials may relate to surrounding buildings. Tall building roof shapes should
be evaluated from the logical point or points from where they would be viewed
rather than from a straight elevation.
   (d)   Materials and Texture. Materials and texture are particularly
important in terms of their relationship to surrounding buildings and the use
of natural materials should be encouraged. Brick color from actual samples
should be evaluated. In many cases, through the skillful use of color,
significant compatibility with the surrounding environment can be developed.
   (e)   Use of Details. In evaluating building details, the primary concern is
for appropriateness to the scale and overall design concept of the building and
its environment. Building details may attempt to recall the spirit of an
earlier period detailing in contemporary application. If the applicant chooses
to reproduce historic details, such as colonial window treatment, etc., it
becomes important that some historical authenticity is maintained. In older
structures, detailing may be highlighted through painting.
   (f)   Use of Live Plant Material. Planting materials should be evaluated on
their use for accentuating and highlighting the architectural details of
screening undesirable areas such as vacant lots, parking and mechanical
equipment (e.g. air conditioning units, generators, dumpsters, etc.). Planting
and landscaping are particularly important where parking lots are utilized.
Larger parking lots (over fifteen cars) should be broken up by interior
landscaping, preferably at the ends of parking aisles. Where year-round
screening is required, evergreen planting is appropriate.
   (g)   Use of Landscape Design. Other elements of exterior design, such as
walls, become a part of the building and tie it to adjoining structures or give
it additional character. Lighting is particularly important, both from the
standpoint of providing light to the pedestrian as well as affecting the view
of the building in the evening hours. Lighting shall be screened from any
potential of shining directly into pedestrians' or auto drivers' eyes. When
appropriate, the applicant should provide a lighting plan as seen at night, or
a photometric plan. Downlighting shall be used unless preempted by other rules
or regulations.
   (h)   Enhancement of Pedestrian Environment. Where possible, elements which
can contribute to the quality of the pedestrian environment and other public
amenities should be promoted. Included among these may be benches, water
fountains, seating areas, arcades, awnings or canopies. Increasing the quality
of the pedestrian environment is one of the major themes of this Zoning
Ordinance. Improving circulation and developing new pedestrian routes, such as
mid-block connections, are particularly desirable.
   (i)   Signage. As regulated by the sign regulations, signage will be most
significant in communicating the character of the building. Signage should be
discreet and minimal. Signs oriented to the pedestrian should be small in
scale; those oriented toward automobile traffic may be larger. Color should be
subdued, and where appropriate, the architectural character of the sign should
be consistent with that of the building. Signs flush on the building face are
in many cases preferable to projecting signs.
   (j)   Other elements necessary to determine appropriateness of the proposed
changes.
      (Ord. 03-2023. Passed 1-18-23.)
1161.07 DEMOLITION PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Former Section
1161.07 was repealed by Ordinance 25-05, passed July 6, 2005.)
1161.08 DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT.

contained within the official document, shall comply with all applicable codes,
laws, and regulations governing the maintenance of property. It is the intent
of this section to preserve those buildings and properties within the Granville
National Historic District from deliberate or inadvertent neglect. It is
further the intent of this section to preserve the architectural and structural
integrity and historical value of those buildings and properties within the
Granville National Historic District. All such buildings and properties within
the Granville National Historic District shall be preserved against such decay
and deterioration, and shall be free from structural defects through prompt
corrections of any of the following defects:

      (5)   Defective or insufficient weather protection for exterior wall
covering, including lack of paint or weathering due to lack of paint or other
protective covering.
      (6)   Any fault or defect in the building which renders it not properly
watertight or structurally unsafe."
   The Village may obtain the services of a structural engineer, architect, or
historic preservation expert in determining what repairs must be made. However,
such services are not a requirement of issuance of a notice of violation.
   (b)   The building or property owner, lessee, or other person in actual
charge of the building or property shall be served with a letter of violation,
delivered by certified mail, as well as hand delivered to the property. The
letter shall outline the violation(s) of this section, and include corrective
actions that must be taken to bring the building or property into compliance.
The letter shall provide for a reasonable period within which the repairs must
be made. Said letter shall also provide a hearing date for Planning Commission,
at which time the letter of violation will be discussed, and the building or
property owner, or their representative, along with members of the public,
shall have the opportunity to respond to the violations. Planning Commission
will determine whether to uphold, amend, or dismiss the violations of this
Section. This hearing will be carried out during a regular meeting of the
Planning Commission, and shall be subject to the rules and procedures as found
in this Zoning Code.
   (c)   A building or property owner, lessee, or other person in actual charge
of the building or property may appeal the Planning Commission decision to the
Board of Zoning and Building Appeals. Such appeal shall be made within ten
business days, excluding national holidays and weekends, from the Planning
Commission decision. The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall determine
whether to uphold, amend, or rescind the violations. The hearing will be held
during a regular meeting of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals, and shall
be subject to that body's rules and procedures contained within this Zoning
Code.
   (d)   A building or property owner, lessee, or other person in actual charge
of the building or property may appeal the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals
decision to the Village Council. Such appeal shall be made within ten business
days, excluding national holidays and weekends, from the Board of Zoning and
Building Appeals decision.
   (e)   Violations of this section are subject to a $500.00 fine, per day.
Days begin accrual once the initial date of Planning Commission hearing has
passed. Accrual shall pause upon submittal of appeal in conformance with this
Chapter. The Village Manager, or their designee, shall have the authority to

   * Minimum lot area requirements shall be determined by the Planning
Commission upon conditions of the proposed development of the land and the
requirements established herein for each development. In measuring lot
coverage, all buildings and other covered areas, such as parking areas,
sidewalks, loading areas, driveways and driveway areas, shall be included.
      (1)    There must be sufficient lot area and width to meet all parking
and yard requirements.

no structure shall be closer than fifty feet and no parking area, loading area
or access drive shall be closer than fifteen feet to the rear lot line.
      (4)    Parking areas shall be no closer to the main structure(s) than ten
feet.
      (5)    Planned Unit District (PUD) parking and accessory building
standards shall be as follows:
         A.    No driveway or parking area shall be within five feet of a side
lot line; or ten feet for multi-family dwellings.
         B.    No driveways or parking areas shall be within ten feet of a rear

single-family dwellings, the maximum total gross square footage of all combined
commercial uses shall not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the total gross
square footage of all combined residential uses in that PUD development.
            2.   As used in this chapter, "buildable" means that part of a lot
or parcel whose development is not rendered infeasible by conditions of flood
hazard, accessibility, or environmental or legal limitation. Any part of a lot
or parcel that is actually developed or to be developed shall be deemed
buildable, and any other part of a lot or parcel shall be presumed buildable in
the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The purpose of
this limitation is to exclude any non-buildable part of a lot or parcel from
consideration when calculating the maximum allowed densities in a PUD
development.
   (c)    Maximum Density - PCD.
      (1)   The gross maximum density in a PCD development shall be as follows:
         A.    Single-family residential: One (1) dwelling unit per buildable

hazard, accessibility, or environmental or legal limitation. Any part of a lot
or parcel that is actually developed or to be developed shall be deemed
buildable, and any other part of a lot or parcel shall be presumed buildable in
the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The purpose of
this limitation is to exclude any non-buildable part of a lot or parcel from
consideration when calculating the maximum allowed densities in a PCD
development.
   (d)    Additional Development Standards Relevant to PCD.
      (1)    Building style and design shall be as set forth in the Building
Style, Building Massing, Roof, Windows, Materials and Colors provisions of

 1175.03(a) of the Zoning Code (building requirements for the Suburban Business
District).
      (2)    The hours of commercial operation shall not exceed 18 hours per
day from 6:00 a.m. through 2:00 a.m., with the exception of office, civic and
institutional uses and home occupations.
      (3)    As to other development standards, the Planning Commission may
impose any of the other requirements of Section
1175.03(a) on property that is currently zoned or that seeks to be zoned as a
Planned Commercial District.
   (e)    General Site Development Considerations.
      (1)    The applicable sections of the Subdivision Regulations and the
parking, sign and landscaping regulations of this Zoning Ordinance shall be
applied. However, a deviation from these regulations may be recommended by the
Planning Commission or approved by Council where appropriate to the integrity
of the development plan. The Commission shall identify any such deviation in
its recommendation to the Council under Section
1171.04.
      (2)    Traffic plan. A traffic and parking system plan shall be shown
that details points of ingress and egress into the property, public and private
drives, parking areas and sidewalk areas. The plan shall be so designed to
minimize conflict points between pedestrian and vehicular movement, while
maintaining ample and safe walkways and pathways.
      (3)    The Planning Commission shall not recommend nor shall Council
approve a development plan unless they find that:
         A.    Such planned development provides adequate ingress and egress.
         B.    The planned development does not adversely impact traffic
patterns, causing traffic delays or increase traffic usage of municipal streets
or existing facilities to the detriment of the safety and welfare of the
public.
         C.    Planned developments fronting on major streets shall be provided
with parallel service streets where feasible in order to limit access to one
intersection on a major street.
         D.    Off-street parking shall be provided as established in Chapter
1183. Parking areas must be located behind the front facade of the proposed
buildings.
      (4)    Parking layout. A detailed parking layout must be shown to include
the following:

to be summed by row.
         B.    Access points and expected movement through and between separate
parking lot areas.
         C.    Expected pedestrian access routes from parking area to stores
for PCD. It is encouraged that the total area used for parking be so designed
so as to create smaller defined parking lot areas in lieu of a single unbroken
paved lot. It is required that adequate landscaping be used to delineate or
accent parking and pedestrian areas. Shared parking for multiple buildings is
strongly encouraged.
      (5)    Development incentives: It is the intent that the Planned District
be an asset to the surrounding development and as such, development incentives
can be granted by the Planning Commission based on the following conditions:
         A.    In PCD and PIO: Dedicated publicly accessible park land , the
amount of acreage to be determined by the Commission. Dedicated site for other
necessary municipal services as accepted by the Village. A maximum credit of
ten percent (10%) additional ground coverage under PCD and PIO may be granted
by the Commission for each of these. Structures, service areas, loading docks,
parking areas and pedestrian sidewalks in no case shall cover more than ninety
percent (90%) of the site, not including publicly dedicated roadways in the
site area calculation.
         B.    In PUD: Dedicated publicly accessible park land, the amount of
acreage to be determined by the Commission. Dedicated school site, the amount
of acreage to be determined by the Commission. Dedicated site for other
necessary municipal services as accepted by the Village. A maximum credit of
five percent (5%) additional ground coverage under PUD may be granted by the
Commission for each of these. Structures, service areas, loading docks, parking
areas and pedestrian sidewalks in no case shall cover more than ninety percent
(90%) of the site, not including publicly dedicated roadways in the site area
calculation.
      (6)    The proposed provisions of all utilities, storm drainage
collection, trash collection systems and the lighting system shall be
specifically detailed. Trash containers shall be sufficiently screened to avoid
nuisance. All litter shall be controlled on site.
      (7)   The applicant shall show evidence of sufficient control over the
land to effectuate the development plan, and the project shall be developed as
a unit with respect both to design and construction.
      (8)    Within the PCD, all service and delivery shall be made to the rear
of the structure(s) or use unless special design treatment or other
circumstances warrant as approved by the Commission.
      (9)    In the PCD District, the outdoor storage and display of
merchandise on sidewalks or plaza areas shall be prohibited. For zoning to PIO,
a descriptive text shall indicate the nature of the activity to be carried on,
expected levels of noise, dust, smoke, glare, odor, vibration, or hazardous
waste to result from the normal operation of the specific industrial activity.
Future expansion plans and uses for all parts of the site are required to be
shown, and may be held as a binding condition for approval by the Commission.
         (Ord. 13-2022. Passed 6-29-22.)
1171.04 PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL.
   In the event that a proposed PUD or PCD includes any use that is designated
by this chapter as a conditional use, prior to or contemporaneously with the
submission of an application for approval of the PUD or PCD as set forth below
the applicant shall apply to the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals for
approval of such conditional use pursuant to Chapter
1145. No proposed PUD or PCD that includes such a conditional use may be
approved by Council until such conditional use has received a final approval
pursuant to Chapter
1145.
   (a)    The owner or developer of the land shall submit an application in
writing to the Village Manager or his/her designee for consideration. Such
application shall include eight copies of a Development Plan for the entire
area proposed to be developed in the Planned District classification. The Plan
shall include information required under Section
1171.03(c) and drawings sufficient to determine adherence to the requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance, including, but not limited to: all proposed and
neighboring structures shall be located, and the drawings shall delineate the
type, color and nature of materials used as well as show square footage, tenant
types and expected entrance(s), service and pedestrian areas for the plan, and
floor plans and elevations. A sample of exterior materials to be used in the
proposed project shall be included as determined necessary by the Commission
(except in the case of brick and natural or cultured stone where samples are
always required).
      The owner or developer shall submit a Site Analysis Plan that identifies
and interprets environmental characteristics and other important resources of
the property. The required Site Analysis Plan is intended to promote the
protection and integration of natural and cultural resources into the
development proposal; encouraging designs that are sensitive to environmental
features on a site. Mapping and analysis of site resources such as vegetation,
slope, historic resources, and drainage patterns of proposed development
layouts are some of the primary reasons for incorporating the site analysis
into this ordinance's plan information requirements.
The Development Plan should also identify preserved and beneficial open space.
An Open Space Management Plan will be required that addresses planned or
permitted uses in the open space as well as maintenance and ownership of the
open space. Stormwater management facilities may be appropriate in the open
space if designed appropriately.
   (b)    A preliminary plat for the first phase shall be filed in addition to
the application and the Plan. It shall include at least twenty percent (20%) of
the total acreage within the Development Plan.
   (c)    The Commission shall review with the applicant the application, the
Development Plan and the preliminary plat for Phase I. The Planning Commission
shall invite the opinions of the Village Engineer and department heads
regarding the application.
   (d)    In determining the acceptability of the Plan, and in addition to the
development and design guidelines set forth in this chapter, the Commission
shall consider distances between buildings, setbacks, yard space, suitability
of open space systems, traffic accessibility, landscaping plans, engineering
feasibility studies, preservation of rate, historically significant, or scenic
existing natural resources, topography, or vegetation, construction sequence
and time schedule for completion of each phase of the project, and other
elements having a bearing on the overall acceptability of the Plan in keeping
with the intent of this section.
   (e)    After review of the application is complete, but before making
recommendation to Council, the Commission shall schedule a public hearing on
the application. The Village Clerk shall cause notice of the date and time of
the hearing to be published in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the Village.
   (f)    After the public hearing, the Commission, shall prepare a cover
memorandum to the application for the Plan, stating its recommendation for
approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval of the plan, submit the
cover memorandum and the application to Council, and send a copy of the cover
memorandum to the applicant. If approval with modifications is recommended, the
Commission shall state any modifications it recommends in the cover memorandum.
Should the Commission recommend disapproval of the Development Plan, the
applicant may resubmit it with modification to the Planning Commission. If the
applicant does not resubmit the plan or state his/her intention to do so within
seven days after the hearing, the Commission shall forward the application and
cover memorandum recommending disapproval of the plan to Council.
   (g)    Upon receipt of a recommendation, the Clerk shall place the
recommendation on the agenda at a subsequent meeting of Council and give public
notice of that fact as set forth in Section
3.06 of the Charter. If Council enacts an ordinance approving the Plan, it
shall be considered a binding condition upon which such zoning is based. An
appropriate notation to that effect shall be made on the face of the four
copies of the Development Plan. One copy each shall be retained by the Planning
Commission, Clerk, applicant, and Zoning Inspector. With approval of the
Commission, minor modifications of the approved Plan may be made. Such
modification shall not increase the overall density on the lot or change the
essential character of the original approved plan. If the Commission determines
that such proposed changes significantly alter the original Plan, such plan
must be resubmitted to Council for approval. The developer shall not proceed
with construction prior to final approval of both the overall Plan and that
specific phase being considered. Any construction that takes place pursuant to
preliminary plan approval without final plan approval shall be considered a
violation of this Zoning Ordinance and an abatable nuisance. The development
shall be in conformance with the Plan, and construction must begin within two
years after the effective date of the Ordinance approving the Plan or the
approval is void. For Plans with multiple phases, construction must commence
within two years of approval of each phase.
   (h)    If the Development Plan is disapproved by Council, the applicant may
consider the reasons for the disapproval, make revisions to the Plan, and
resubmit it to the Planning Commission as a new Development Plan.

   (a)   Application for a Zoning and Architectural Permit in the VGD shall be
submitted with eight complete copies of the required plan (except for any
required samples of exterior materials where only one sample of each material
is required), to the Zoning Inspector.
   Applications must be complete in order to be processed. However, partial
processing of an application by the Village does not eliminate the requirement
for providing further information as necessary to meet the review as described
in this Chapter
1173. The time frames as established in Section
1141.05 shall be applicable.
   (b)    After staff review and recommendations, the application and plans
shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for hearing. The Commission may

the approval, under the application as contingently approved by the Commission,
of the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals of any conditional uses(s) and
variance(s), or deny the application. In all other cases, after the hearing and
consideration, the Commission shall approve or deny the application, or approve
with modifications.
   (d)    Thereafter, the Zoning Inspector shall issue or refuse to issue a
Zoning and Architectural Permit. In all circumstances, the site plan shall be
considered a condition of approval of the application. Construction must start
within twelve months and be completed within twenty-four months from the date
of final approval. With approval of the Commission, subsequent minor
modifications of the approved site plan may be made, provided such changes do
not alter the essential character, as determined by the Commission, of the
original plan as approved. If the Commission determines that such changes are
significant, the site plan shall be resubmitted to the Commission for approval
as a new application. Any new construction, exterior modification or structural
alteration to existing structures which proceed prior to final approval of the
site plan shall be deemed to be an abatable nuisance.
   (e)    Appeals. Appeals from decisions of the Commission on an application
for site plan approval may be had as provided in Chapter
1141.

regulations of this Overlay District.
   (a)   Sanitary landfills, drywells and the filling in of land with
demolition debris or other non-approved matter, and junkyards, are prohibited.
   (b)   Commercial or other facilities for the washing of vehicles or
equipment shall be permitted only if the wastewater from such facilities is
entirely channeled into the sanitary sewer system.
   (c)   Wastewater treatment plant discharges are permitted when subject to
discharge limitations prescribed by the appropriate state and national
regulatory agencies.
   (d)   If a nonconforming use of any land, building or structure is
discontinued for six months or more, any further use shall be in conformity
with this District.
1174.06 GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Use, storage, handling and/or production of Regulated or Hazardous
Substances in conjunction with permitted and conditional uses in this district
shall be limited as to each use, to:
      (1)   The aggregate of Regulated or Hazardous Substances in use, storage,
handling and/or production may not exceed 20 gallons or 160 pounds at any time.
      (2)   The total use, storage, handling and/or production of Regulated or
Hazardous Substances may not exceed 50 gallons or 400 pounds in any twelve
month period.
   (b)   Storage of fuel and lubricants for vehicle operations in conjunction
with permitted and conditional uses in this district shall be in underground
tanks placed above the floor surface of a below grade vault. Such tanks shall
be of double-wall construction, and otherwise assembled and installed in
accordance with applicable regulations. The vault shall allow access for
physical inspection of the tank for leakage and the interior of vault shall be
continuously monitored and alarmed to provide for automatic and immediate
detection of any release from the tank.
   (c)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, non-conforming uses
in this district presently utilizing underground storage tanks shall be
permitted to replace existing tanks with those constructed as per the
specifications of
 1174.06(b) above, and not exceeding the capacity of existing tanks.
   (d)   No substitutions of a non-conforming use shall be permitted which
results in an increase of the Hazardous Potential Ranking System on a parcel
within this district. If the Hazardous Potential Ranking decreases for a non-
conforming use for a period of twelve months or more, the non-conforming right
to the higher Hazardous Potential Ranking shall be deemed to have been lost
through non-use for that period of time.
   (e)   Heating fuels for residential use in tanks having a capacity of 500
gallons or less are exempt from this ordinance.
1174.07 HAZARD POTENTIAL RANKING SYSTEM FOR NON- CONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Any existing uses legally storing, handling using and/or producing
Regulated or Hazardous Substances in amounts equal to or less than the
requirements under section
1174.06 are considered conforming uses and this section does not apply. Any new
use or change of uses shall maintain the conforming status of the property.
   (b)   Existing non-conforming uses shall be permitted to maintain the
reported maximum quantity for each reportable Regulated or Hazardous Substance,
as determined by peak business cycle. Existing uses and maximum quantities, in
combination with a hazard potential rating shall run with the land and be
administered in conformance with all other applicable non-conforming provisions
of the Village of Granville Code.
   (c)   In order to assess the risk for potential groundwater contamination, a
hazard ranking has been developed for various activities categorized by their
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. This ranking is based on the
kind of materials commonly associated with each use looking only at the most
critical hydrologic factors. This ranking, published and updated regularly by
the USEPA, is hereby incorporated by reference.
1174.08 REGULATED MATERIALS ACTIVITY INVENTORY.
   (a)   Except as provided in Section

1175.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of the Suburban Business District is to provide
suitable areas for a mixed use, visually integrated neighborhood with a
moderate concentration of various types of compatible businesses to service
neighborhood needs, and residences while providing neighborhood and Village
enhancing features, such as adequate parking, appropriate landscaping,
screening, desirable aesthetics, and site design intended to eliminate adverse
effects of traffic congestion. The Suburban Business District is intended to
provide increased tax revenues to both the local schools and the Village, while
minimizing costs to the Village for infrastructure acquisition and maintenance,
and with preservation or enhancement of, rather than harm to, neighborhood,
Village, and Granville Township quality of life and property values.

      (Ord. 15-08. Passed 1-7-09.)
1175.05 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)    Application for a Zoning Permit in the SBD shall be submitted with
eleven complete copies of the required site plan (except for any required
samples of exterior materials where only one sample of each material is
required), to the Zoning Inspector. Applications must be completed in order to
be processed. However, partial processing of an application by the Village does
not eliminate the requirement for providing further information as necessary to
meet the review as described in this Chapter
1175. The time frames as established in Section
1141.05 shall be applicable.
   (b)    After staff review and recommendations, the application and plans
shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for hearing. The Commission may
request additional information from the Zoning Inspector in order to make its
recommendation. In determining the acceptability of the site plan, the
Commission shall consider all of the requirements in the development standards
and design guidelines of Section
 1175.03.
   (c)    In the case of an application for one or more conditional uses and/or
applications involving one or more variances, after the hearing and
consideration, the Commission shall, either with or without application
modifications, approve the application contingent on the applicant obtaining
the approval, under the application as contingently approved by the Commission,
of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals of any conditional uses(s) and
variance(s), or deny the application. In all other cases, after the hearing and
consideration, the Commission shall approve or deny the application, or approve
with modifications.
   (d)   Thereafter, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a Zoning Permit. In all
circumstances, the site plan shall be considered a condition of approval of the
application. Construction must start within twelve months and be completed
within twenty-four months from the date of final approval. With approval of the
Zoning Inspector, subsequent minor modifications of the approved site plan may
be made, provided such changes do not alter the essential character, as
determined by the Zoning Inspector of the original plan as approved. If the
Zoning Inspector determines that such changes are significant, the site plan
shall be resubmitted to the Commission for approval as a new application. Any
new construction, exterior modification or structural alteration to existing
structures which proceed prior to final approval of the site plan shall be
deemed to be an abatable nuisance.
   (e)   Appeals . Appeals from decisions of the Commission on an application
for site plan approval may be had as provided in Chapter
1141.

CHAPTER 1176
Transportation Corridor Overlay District
1176.01   Interpretation.
1176.02   Purpose.
1176.03   District area.
1176.04   Corridor district design, development and maintenance standards.
1176.05   Cherry Valley Road corridor standards.
 
 
 
1176.01 INTERPRETATION.
   The intent of this Chapter is to establish a zoning district which is to
overlay existing zoning districts, the purpose of which is to impose additional
regulations or incentives on the manner in which properties in such districts
are used, in addition to those regulations or incentives imposed by the
underlying zoning. By definition, an overlay district incorporates more than
one category of land use (district). (Ord. 06-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1176.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this corridor overlay district is to protect and preserve the
visual qualities, existing open space, and historic landscapes of major
community entry points and to preserve rural character, all of which identify
and define the Granville community. This district will maintain the long-term
function of these corridors by limiting access points and curb openings,
providing opportunities for improved pedestrian and bicycle circulation,
promoting architectural continuity and good design, and protecting important
scenic vistas, trees and vegetation stands. Promoting desirable relationships
between circulation systems and adjacent land uses and controlling signs,
parking areas, and buildings along community signature streets are additional
benefits.
(Ord. 06-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1176.03 DISTRICT AREA.
   The following is the area of the corridor district:
All land within one hundred (100) feet of the right-of-way line of Newark-
Granville Road, West Broadway, State Route 661, South Main Street, and Welsh
Hills Road between the Village Architectural Review District and the Village
limits. Also, all addresses and lands on North Cherry Valley Road, South Galway
Drive, and Westgate Drive.
(Ord. 06-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1176.04 CORRIDOR DISTRICT DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Setback Requirements. Setbacks in areas designated for office,
commercial, or similar uses should be consistent with other buildings already
constructed within
the general area.
   (b)    Access and Circulation. Access and circulation standards that apply
include the following:
      (1)    A maximum of two curb cuts per property frontage are permitted.
      (2)    Limited frontage roads and shared curb cuts should be encouraged.
      (3)    Pedestrian access should be provided and designed to minimize
automobile/pedestrian conflict.
   (c)   Development Standards.
      (1)    Utility and transmission lines are to be located in underground
conduit wherever possible.
      (2)    Loading areas, public parking areas, storage areas including trash
storage receptacles shall be completely screened from corridor roads.
      (3)    For any lot splits of any parcel originally within the TCOD (in
whole or in part) the minimum lot size for any parcel shall not be less than
one (1) acre.
   (d)   Landscaping Requirements. The objective is a comprehensive landscape
program for each parcel or lot within the Corridor Overlay District, to protect
and promote the appearance, character, and economic value of lands along the
corridor and surrounding neighborhoods. Elements include tree preservation,
landscape plan and planting requirements, parking area requirements, and
maintenance standards. Landscape requirements to be submitted for review by the
Planning Commission include the following:
      (1)    A landscaped greenbelt area shall be provided between the building
(s) and roadway edge. This area shall include only plant material, plazas,
walks and bikeways, sculpture, or signage. Such greenbelt treatment shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review. Existing vegetation shall be
preserved and protected as much as feasible, and large proposed plantings shall
be exhibited or illustrated on submitted proposals.
      (2)    Details of the location, type, size, and amount of plant material
proposed as well as areas of tree preservation, existing plant material and
greenbelt treatment.
      (3)    Outdoor lighting plans.
   (e)   Fences, Walls or Barriers. No fence, wall or other artificial barrier
shall be erected and/or constructed in this district without prior approval of
the Planning Commission. Approval shall be based upon review of an application
as set forth in Section
1137.05 of the Codified Ordinances of Granville, Ohio. Planning Commission
review shall include type, location, height, compatibility with the area and
such other features or characteristics as may be appropriate.
(Ord. 08-2022. Passed 5-5-22.)
1176.05 CHERRY VALLEY ROAD CORRIDOR STANDARDS.
   The Village desires to insure that new developments and redevelopments on
lands served by Cherry Valley Road (and South Galway Drive) do not overwhelm
the carrying capacity of the new roadway system. As such, the Village has
adopted a plan, with standards, that: limits corridor traffic volumes to
acceptable levels and, defines specific points of access for the properties.
   (a)   In order to maintain a safe and effective roadway system within the
Cherry Valley Road corridor, the number of access points on Cherry Valley Road
and South Galway Drive shall be minimized. The access points shall be located
properly and be of appropriate design. Referencing Figures 1 and 2, and
recognizing that long-term development/redevelopment is being considered, the
following "access management" guidelines shall be followed:
      (1)   Prohibit access for Site A off Newark-Granville Road.
      (2)   Permit up to two full access points for Site A on South Galway
Road.
         A.   Drive A-1 is located opposite Donegal Drive.
         B.   Drive A-2 is located about 500 feet southeast of Donegal Drive.
      (3)   Permit one full access point for Site A on Cherry Valley Road. This
point of access should be located approximately 400 feet north of the
centerline of South Galway Drive. This driveway (Drive A-3) should align with
the driveway serving Site C.
      (4)   Permit up to two full access points for Site B on South Galway
Drive.
         A.   Drive B-1 should be aligned with Drive A-2 - which should be
located about 500 feet southeast of Donegal Drive.
         B.   Drive B-2, which primarily serves as an access road for Wendy's,
could also be used to serve Site B - particularly the portion of the tract that
lies north of Wendy's between Drive B-2 and Cherry Valley Road. The
intersection of Drive B-2 on South Galway Drive should be placed approximately
350 feet west of the centerline of Cherry Valley Road.
      (5)   Permit one access point for Site B on Cherry Valley Road. This
access point could serve the portion of the tract north of Wendy's between
Drive B-2 and Cherry Valley Road.
      (6)   Alternate access for Wendy's shall be provided via Drive B-2 as
described above, unless this requirement is waived by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Provide one full access point for Site C on Cherry Valley Road.
This access point (Drive C) should align with Drive A-3 that serves Site A
which should be located approximately 400 feet north of the centerline of South
Galway Drive. (A single access point serving Site C would be realized only with
the redevelopment of the involved properties. If the involved properties are
redeveloped, consideration shall be given to the elimination of access for Site
C on Newark-Granville Road.)
      (8)   Provide one full access point for Site D on Cherry Valley Road.
This access point (Drive D) should align with South Galway Drive.
      (9)   Provide northbound and southbound left turn lanes, as appropriate,
on Cherry Valley Road at its intersections with South Galway Drive/Drive D,
Drive A-3/Drive C, and Newark-Granville Road.

1177.01 FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT ESTABLISHED.
   There is hereby established a Flood Hazard Overlay District within the
Village of Granville, Ohio. This Overlay District shall apply to all special
flood hazard and areas of future conditions flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the Village as identified in Section
1177.04 of the Codified Ordinances, including any additional special flood
hazard areas annexed by the Village of Granville. The underlying zoning
district as shown on the Official Zoning Map shall hereafter be called the base
district. Uses and minimum requirements shall be determined by the base
district. However, if the provisions governing the overlay district are
stricter than those of the base district, the provisions of this Chapter shall
supersede those of the base district.
(Ord. 02-09. Passed 3-18-09.)
1177.02 TITLE AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Granville has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of Chapter
1177 of the Codified Ordinances, which are referred to herein as “regulations,”
to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (d)   Statutory Authorization. This Chapter is adopted pursuant to Article
XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, which grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use regulations and to control measures for
promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. (Ord. 03-07.
Passed 3-21-07.)
1177.03 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      (1)   "Accessory Structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      (2)   "Appeal" means a request for review of the Floodplain
Administrator's interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a
request for a variance.
      (3)   "Base Flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
      (4)   "Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)" means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).

or storage of equipment or materials.
      (7)   "Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor". See "Lowest Floor."
      (8)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)" issued by President
Carter in 1977. This order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
      (9)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with
the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
      (10)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial
means.
      (11)   "Flood or Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
         A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
         B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
      (12)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
      (13)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
      (14)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
         A.   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
         B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
         C.   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
         D.   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
         E.   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
         F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas
subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
         G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
      (15)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
      (16)   "Flood Protection Elevation" means the Flood Protection Elevation,
or FPE, and is the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (17)   "Floodway" means a channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
      (18)   "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet
above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris
and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
         A.   "Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area" also known as area of
future conditions flood hazard, the land area that would be inundated by the
one percent annual chance flood based on future conditions hydrology.
      (19)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
         A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
         B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
         C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (20)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
      (21)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are
broken down into the following categories:
         A.   "Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)" means a revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance
Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special
flood hazard area.
         B.   "Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)" means a revision based on
technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood
zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric
features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning
whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood
elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         C.   "Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)"means a formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
      (22)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
      (23)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or
more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use
with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required
utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational
vehicle". For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes
manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (24)   "Manufactured home park". As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park is any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
      (25)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      (26)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Granville Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 17, 1982, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
      (27)   "Person" means any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the
Adjutant General's Department, or any court.
      (28)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (1) built on a
single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently
towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a
permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping,
travel, or seasonal use.
      (29)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (30)   "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (31)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (32)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" means the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year, also
known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard". Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
      (33)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
      (34)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home,
or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
      (35)   "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a 10-year period
for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
      (36)   "Substantial Improvement" means any reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the "start of construction" of the improvement. When the combined total of all
previous improvements or repairs made during the life of the structure equals
or exceeds 50 percent of a structure's market value, that structure is
considered a substantial improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
         A.   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction";
         B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
      (37)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
      (38)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development
to be fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 02-09. Passed 3-18-09.)
1177.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of this Chapter, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective 05/02/2007.
      (2)   Other studies and maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Granville as required by Subdivisions and Large Scale
Development Section
1177.06(b) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at 141 East Broadway, Granville, Ohio.
   (b)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances or resolutions, including
Subdivision Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not intend to impair any deed restriction,
covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
   (c)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
   (d)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or areas of future conditions flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Granville,
any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (e)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 02-09.
Passed 3-18-09.)
1177.05 PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES.

         (Ord. 02-09. Passed 3-18-09.)
1177.06 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS.
   The following development standards and regulations shall apply to
development wholly within, partially within, or in contact with any special
flood hazard area as established in Sections
 1177.04 or
1177.08(j):
   (a)   Water and Wastewater Systems. The following standards shall apply to
all water supply, sanitary sewerage and waste disposal systems not otherwise
regulated by the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
      (3)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to or contamination from them during flooding.
   (b)   Subdivisions and Large Developments.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and are subject to all applicable standards in these
regulations;
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage;
      (4)   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation
data are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all major
(platted) subdivision proposals and other proposed developments at least 5
acres in size;
      (5)   The applicant shall meet the requirement to submit technical data
to FEMA in Section
1177.08(i)(1)A.4. of the Codified Ordinances when a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis is completed that generates base flood elevations as required by
Section 1
177.06(b)(4) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (6)   All preliminary plans for platted subdivisions shall identify the
flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood.
      (7)   All final subdivision plats will provide the boundary of the
special flood hazard area, the floodway boundary, and base flood elevations.
      (8)   In platted subdivisions, all proposed lots or parcels that will be
future building sites shall have a minimum buildable area outside the natural
(non-filled) 1% chance annual floodplain. The buildable area shall be large
enough to accommodate primary structure and associated structures such as
sheds, barns, swimming pools, detached garages, on-site sewage disposal
systems, and water supply wells, if applicable.
      (9)   Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision, which
would be subject to flooding. All street surfaces must be located at or above
the base flood elevation.
   (c)   Residential Structures.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
Where a structure, including its foundation members, is elevated on fill to or
above the base flood elevation, the requirements for anchoring under Section
1177.06(c)(1) of the Codified Ordinances and construction materials resistant
to flood damage Section
1177.06(c)(2) of the Codified Ordinances are satisfied.
      (2)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with methods and materials resistant to flood damage.
      (3)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities that are designed and/or elevated so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
      (4)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the flood protection elevation. Where flood
protection elevation data are not available the structure shall have the lowest
floor, including basement, elevated at least two feet above the highest
adjacent natural grade. Support structures and other foundation members shall
be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as designed in
accordance with ASCE 24, Flood Resistant Design and Construction.
      (5)   New construction and substantial improvements, including
manufactured homes, that do not have basements and that are elevated to the
flood protection elevation using pilings, columns, posts, or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood
waters may have an enclosure below the lowest floor provided the enclosure
meets the following standards:
         A.   Be used only for the parking of vehicles, building access, or
storage; and
         B.   Be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters; or
         C.   Have a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total
net area not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area,
and the bottom of all such openings being no higher than one foot above grade.
The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than 1.0 (one) foot increase in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of 1.0 (one) foot or less of the base flood elevation and an
explanation why these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   The requirements of Section
1177.06(h)(1)B.1. and 3. - 5. of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of

stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Granville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1177.08(i)(1)A.3. of the Codified Ordinances when an alteration of a
watercourse results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood
hazard area, including the placement of culverts.
      (4)   Compensatory Storage Required for Fill. Fill within the area of
special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special
flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage
by excavation or other compensatory measures as follows: 1) on-site; or 2) on
other property, as determined by a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Manager and/or engineer with jurisdiction
over that property.
   (i)   Critical Development.  
      (1)   Critical development is that which is critical to the community's
public health and safety, are essential to the orderly functioning of a
community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials,
or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or
injury. Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools,
fire stations, service facilities, nursing homes, wastewater treatment
facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/ propane storage facilities.
      (2)   Critical developments shall be elevated to the 500-year flood
elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where
records are available) or two feet above the (100 year) base flood elevation,
whichever is greater. If no data exists establishing the 500-year flood
elevation or highest known historical flood elevation, the applicant shall
provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year
flood elevation data.
   (j)   Fill. The following standards apply to all fill activities in special
flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the
Standard Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method.
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal.
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided.
When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or less
protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover.
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
   (k)   Storage of Materials. Storage of material or equipment not otherwise
prohibited in Section
1177.05 (b) shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village of Granville flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1177.04(a) of the Codified Ordinances accurately represent flooding conditions
so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current data, the
following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
areas;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of

FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1177.08(i)(1)A. of the Codified Ordinances.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Village Manager of
the Village of Granville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Granville have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Granville's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the
Village of Granville boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Granville suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Granville has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (j)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard and areas of future conditions flood hazard. A person contesting
the determination of the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section
1177.09 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard or
area of future conditions flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base
flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation
profile, floodway data table, established high water marks, etc.) shall
prevail.
   (k)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including tornado, wind, heavy snow, flood, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (4)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

1177.09 APPEALS FROM DETERMINATIONS OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where
it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or
enforcement of the regulations set forth in this Chapter. The appeal shall be
conducted under the procedures set forth in Chapter
1139. of the Codified Ordinances of the Village.
(Ord. 03-07. Passed 3-21-07.)
1177.10 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variances. The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the
power to hear and decide applications for variances in the application of these
regulations, where such variance is not inconsistent with Federal regulations,
and where a variance from the standards of these regulations will not be
contrary to the public interest, and where, owning to special conditions of the
lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations
would result in unnecessary hardship. The Board shall hear and decide an
application for a variance in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Chapter
1139 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village.
   (b)   Application. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. All applications for a variance shall be
accompanied by a variance application fee set in the zoning fee schedule.
   (c)   Considerations. In considering an application for a variance under
this Section, the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall consider and make
findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (d)   Determinations. Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good
and sufficient cause and:
      (1)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (2)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (3)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (4)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (e)   Limitations.  In addition to the other requirements of this Section, a
variance shall only be issued upon the following conditions:
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1177.10(c)(1)-(11) of the Codified Ordinances have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond one- half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
these regulations.
(Ord. 03-07. Passed 3-21-07.)

interest. Such conditions and the amount of the performance bond shall be

1182.01  PURPOSE.
   This chapter regulates the operation of short-term rental properties in the
Village of Granville. The provisions of this chapter are necessary to prevent
unreasonable burdens on services and unreasonable impacts on residential
neighborhoods posed by short-term rental operations. Special regulation of
these uses is necessary to ensure that they will be compatible with surrounding
uses and will not act to harm and alter the neighborhoods in which they are
located. Maintenance of Granville's existing residential neighborhoods is
essential to its continued vitality and economic strength. It is the intent of
this chapter to benefit the general public by minimizing adverse impacts of
short-term rental operations on the local housing supply at all income levels,
and to minimize adverse impacts of the transient and semi-commercial character
of short-term rental operations on adjacent residential uses.
(Ord. 01-2022. Passed 2-2-22.)

with the reservation and/or payment services provided for the short-term rental
transaction.

divided by the number of sleeping rooms in service at the short-term rental.

short-term rental business by providing and collecting or receiving a fee for
booking services through which a short-term rental host may offer a short-term
rental to a short-term rental guest. Hosting platforms usually, though not

short-term rental host to advertise the short-term rental through a website
provided by the hosting platform and the hosting platform conducts a

of this chapter. A boarding house or lodging house, a rooming house, and a

time as the Responsible Party complies with these precautions.
(Ord. 26-2021. Passed 5-18-22.)
1184.09 TREE PRESERVATION INCENTIVES.
   In order to encourage the preservation of existing Trees on a site,
incentives for the retention and protection of existing, undisturbed,
structurally sound and healthy Trees shall be granted in accordance with the
following standards:
   (a)    For each Tree preserved and protected in accordance with the
standards of this Chapter, a credit in the amount of one and one-half times the
number of preserved trees shall be credited and applied towards the Tree
planting requirements for landscaping and buffering. To receive credit, the
preserved Trees must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Canopy Trees, whether deciduous or evergreen, shall have a minimum
diameter of eight (8) inches, as measured four and one-half (4 ½) feet above
ground level.
      (2)    Understory or ornamental trees, whether deciduous or evergreen,
shall have a minimum diameter of four (4) inches, as measured four and one-half
(4 ½) feet above ground level.
      (3)    For credit towards the tree planting requirements in Section
1193.07, Tree Planting Requirements, the preserved tree(s) must be located
inside, or within thirty (30) feet of, the planting area for which the credit
will be applied.
   (b)    Approved tree preservation credits may be applied to the tree
planting requirements for street yard landscaping, motor vehicle use area
landscaping, street trees, or perimeter buffers as appropriate. In no case
shall tree preservation credits be used to offset more than fifty percent (50%)
of the required number of trees in the area to which they are applied.
   (c)    When Trees preserved and credited in accordance with Section
1184.11 are located inside, or within fifteen (15) feet of, the perimeter of a
motor vehicle use area containing required parking spaces, the minimum parking
requirement, as set forth in Section
 1183.03, may be reduced by two and five-tenths percent (2.5%) for each
preserved tree that meets these standards. In no case shall the minimum parking
requirement be reduced by more than fifteen percent (15%), regardless of the
number of trees preserved.
      (Ord. 26-2021. Passed 5-18-22.)
1184.10 TREE PLANTING AND REPLACEMENT.
   (a)    Species selection shall be based upon the amount of space available
for proper growth on the site in accordance with width of Tree lawn as
specified in the Village Code, Section
1193.04; and informed by the most current Preferred Tree List maintained by the
Village Planner.
   (b)   The Applicant is expected to plant Trees in locations on the site
where the environmental benefits of canopy cover are most likely to offset the
impact of development. Trees shall not be placed within utility easements, or
in other locations where their future protection cannot be assured.
   (c)   Approval of a plan shall be contingent upon the Applicant depositing
with the Village either bond or other insurance/surety in an amount equal to
the estimated cost of materials and labor of Trees at the time of installation.
   (d)   Every effort shall be made to replant a minimum of fifty percent (50%)
of the required Replacement Trees in another location on the site from which
the original Trees were removed to maintain the remaining natural distribution
of Tree cover in the Village.
   (e)   Replacement Tree shall, to the extent possible, have a minimum caliper
of two (2) inches and a clear trunk height of at least six (6) feet. The
schedule for Replacement Trees will be based on the diameter, twenty-four (24)
inches above grade of those Trees removed. Replacement Trees shall equal the
diameter or aggregate diameter of the Tree(s) removed; i.e., removal of a
twenty-four (24)-inch diameter Tree at twenty-four (24) inches above grade
would equal twelve (12), two (2) inch diameter Trees.
(Ord. 26-2021. Passed 5-18-22.)
1184.11 REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE FOR HEAVILY WOODED SITES.
   In lieu of the provisions above, the Responsible Party of a Heavily Wooded
Site shall, during the course of development, be required to retain or replace
Protected Trees so that a minimum of forty percent (40%) of the development
site shall, to the extent possible, remain under canopy coverage. This
calculation shall be a measured estimate based on Tree size and canopy achieved
over a thirty (30) year period.
   Where it is impractical or not feasible to achieve a forty percent (40%)
canopy, the Village Planner may approve one, or any combination of, the
following alternatives as a means of meeting the Tree replacement requirements:
   (a)    Replace as many Trees as is practical on the affected lot; and/or
   (b)    Replace as many Trees as is practical within the affected subdivision
phase; and/or
   (c)    Replace as many Trees as is practical within the affected
subdivision; and/or
   (d)    For those Trees that cannot be replaced through steps one through
three above, the developer or owner shall be required to replace the Trees
elsewhere in the Village; and/or
   (e)   Donate two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per Tree removed payable to
the Village Tree Bank Fund for purchase and planting of Replacement Trees at an
alternate location, up to a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).
      (Ord. 26-2021. Passed 5-18-22.)
1184.12  EXEMPTIONS FROM REPLACEMENT.
   The Village Planner or designee may approve the removal of a Protected Tree
that would be exempt from replacement requirements if one of the following
applies:
   (a)    The Tree is dead, damaged, or diseased; or
   (b)    The Tree is an undesirable species in its present location, as
determined by the Village Planner (or designee); or
   (c)    The Tree presents a potential danger to life or property.

   The height limitations stipulated elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance shall
not apply to the following:
   (a)   Farm Buildings, Architectural Features, etc. Barns, silos, or other
farm buildings or structures on farms; church spires, belfries, cupolas and

structure exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the corresponding street lot line
frontage; towers and monuments, fire towers, hose towers, cooling towers, grain
elevators, gas holders or other structures where the manufacturing process
requires a greater height.
1187.02 YARD AND FRONTAGE MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Steep Slopes; Front Yard Garage. In any SR District or the VR District
where the natural grade of a lot within the required front yard has an average
slope, normal to the front lot line at every point along such line, of such a
degree or percent of slope that it is not practicable to provide a driveway
with a grade of twelve percent (12%) or less to a private garage conforming to
the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, such garage may be located within
such front yard, but not in any case closer than twelve feet to the street
right-of-way line.
   (b)   Side Yard Modifications; Corner Lot. For a side yard along the side
street lot line of a corner lot, which lot abuts the rear, either directly or
across the alley, the side lot line shall have a width equal to the required
depth of the front yard on such other lot fronting the side street.
   (c)   Frontage Modifications. In the case of curvilinear streets and cul-de-
sacs, the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals may authorize a reduction of the
otherwise specified lot frontage in SR Districts, provided that:
      (1)   The lot width measured at the building line equals the frontage
required in the district where located;
      (2)   The front lot line is not less than forty feet in any event; and
      (3)   Such reduction of frontage will not result in a reduction of the
required lot area.
1187.03 YARD PROJECTIONS.
   (a)   Projections of Architectural Features. Certain architectural features
may project into required yard or courts as follows:
      (1)   Cornices, canopies, eaves or similar architectural features, may
project a distance not exceeding four feet.
      (2)   Fire escapes may project a distance not exceeding four feet, six
inches.
      (3)   An uncovered stair and necessary landings may project a distance
not to exceed six feet, provided such stair and landing shall not extend above
the entrance floor of the building except for a railing not exceeding three
feet in height.
      (4)   Bay windows, balconies, uncovered porches and chimneys may project
a distance not exceeding three feet, provided that such features do not occupy,
in the aggregate, more than one-third of the length of the building wall on
which they are located.
      (5)   Interior side yard. The above-named features may project into any
side yard adjoining an interior side lot line, a distance not to exceed one-
fifth of the required least width of such side yard, but not exceeding three
feet in any case.
      (6)   Rear yards. Subject to the limitation in subsection (a)(5) hereof,
the features named therein may project into any rear yards the same distances
they are permitted to project into a front yard.
   (b)   Fences, Walls and Hedges.  
      (1)   Intent. It is the intent of this Fence Code to regulate the
placement of fencing, walls or any combination thereof within the front, side,
and rear yards of any property within the Village. It is further the purpose of
this Code to maintain clear visibility of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on
adjacent streets, alleys, and sidewalks that may otherwise be affected by
fencing and/or wall locations and heights; to maintain an orderly appearance
and reduce any negative impact upon other properties where such fencing or
walls are directly visible from and adjacent to, public streets; and,
therefore, to regulate the location, height, material composition, landscaping,
and overall general fence characteristics.
      (2)   Front Yard Restrictions. No person shall erect any fence or wall in
the Village between the front yard setback line and the street; with the
exception that decorative landscaping walls and fences which do not exceed
forty-two inches (42") in height above ground level may be allowed. This type
of fence must meet the following requirements:
         (a)   That the proposed decorative landscape wall or fence is
compatible with other similar structures in the neighborhood.
         (b)   That the height of said fence or wall does not exceed forty-two
inches (42") in height when measured from the average grade of the yard where
the fence or wall is to be installed. Artificially raising the height of the
lot line by the use of mounding, retaining walls, or similar means shall be
included in the forty-two inch (42") maximum height.
         (c)   The installation of such fence and/or wall shall not create a
visibility or safety concern for vehicular and/or pedestrian movement.
         (d)   That no chain link, wire mesh, concrete block, or other similar
type material can be installed fronting a street as a decorative landscape wall
or fence.
      (3)   Side and Rear Yard Restrictions. No fence, wall, or combination
thereof shall exceed seventy-two inches (72") in height as measured from the
average grade of that portion of the lot in the rear or side yards. No side
yard fence shall extend beyond the front setback line of the house.
Artificially raising the height of the lot line by the use of mounding,
retaining walls, or similar means shall be included within the seventy-two
(72") maximum height restriction. Any fence or wall erected along the side or
rear property lines must have the finished and not the structural side facing
the neighboring property, alley, or street.
      (4)   Corner Lots. No fence, wall, or combination thereof shall exceed
forty-two inches (42") in height in the side yard setback area as it faces a
public or private street. Fencing or walls exceeding forty-two inches (42") in
height but in no case higher than seventy-two inches (72") as measured from the
average grade may be allowed. This type of fence must meet the following
requirements:
         (a)   That the proposed side yard fence or wall on the street side of
a corner lot exceeding forty-two inches (42") in height is compatible with
other similar structures in the neighborhood.
         (b)   That the height of such fence or wall shall not exceed seventy-
two inches (72") in height; artificially raising the height of the lot line by
the use of mounding, retaining walls, or similar means shall be included within
the seventy-two inch maximum height.
         (c)   The installation of such fence or wall shall not create a
visibility or safety concern for vehicular and/or pedestrian movement.
      (5)   Prohibited Fences. No person shall erect or maintain anywhere in
the Village a fence or wall equipped with or having barbed wire, spikes, sharp
points, or any similar device or an electrical charge sufficient to cause shock
except, as part of an agricultural operation or for safety ad protection of
individuals from hazard, such as electric substations.
1187.04 LOT AREA REQUIREMENTS; PRIVATE SANITARY FACILITIES.
   Any other regulations of this Zoning Ordinance notwithstanding or as
otherwise determined by the County Board of Health, in any district where
public water and sanitary facilities are not accessible, the lot area per
single-family dwelling and lot frontage requirements otherwise specified for
residential uses shall be increased as follows:
   (a)   Sewerage and Water Not Available. Where both public sewerage and
public water supply are not accessible:
         Minimum lot area - 1 acre
         Minimum lot frontage - 125 feet
   (b)   Sewerage Not Available. Where public water supply is accessible and
private connections will be made, but where public sewerage is not accessible:
         Minimum lot area - 1 acre

   (a)    To establish a permit system to allow a variety of sign types in
Granville zoning districts, and a limited variety of signs in other zones,
subject to the standards and permit procedures of this chapter.
    (b)    To allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental
to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject
to the substantive requirements of this chapter.
    (c)    To provide for temporary signs without commercial messages in
limited circumstances in the public right of way.
    (d)    To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this chapter.

1189.04 COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height:
   (a)   Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or
triangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation,
emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an
integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the
sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not
including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when
such fence or wall otherwise meets Zoning Ordinance regulations and is clearly
incidental to the display itself (See Table 1189 A for example drawing). For
freestanding signs, the entire sign face shall be included in the computation.
   (b)   Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back
to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time,
and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more
than 24 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one
of the faces.
   (c)   Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to existing
grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or
excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the
normal grade can not reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on
the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign
is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street
or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure
on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
   (d)   Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Zone Lot. The
permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be
computed by applying the formulas contained in Table 1189 B.

SATELLITE DISH AND COMMUNICATION TOWERS FOR COMMUNICATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
 
1191.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of Sections
 1191.01  through
1191.07 is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of
satellite dish antennae, communication towers and wireless communication
facilities to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at
the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of a
competitive wireless communications marketplace in the Village.
   (b)   The Village's intent is to encourage wireless communications service
providers that seek to further the following Village priorities:
      (1)   Co-locate on/with other existing towers/structures/facilities or
locate on existing structures.
      (2)   Require new towers and other related structures to accommodate
multiple users wherever practicable.
      (3)   Locate towers in the least obtrusive locations and manner using
present and evolving technology.
      (4)   Minimize adverse impacts on health, safety and public welfare, and
minimize visual impacts through co-location, siting, design, and construction,
while upholding the purposes and objectives of this chapter.
         (Ord. 11-2018. Passed 10-3-18.)
1191.02 OBJECTIVES.
   The following are the Village's objectives regarding wireless communication
regulations:
   (a)   To comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended,
including any subsequent rules and/or rule interpretations by appropriate state
and federal agencies and/or courts.
   (b)   To work proactively with wireless communications providers to ensure
rapid and reliable deployment of their services/technologies, while minimizing
negative effects on the Village.
   (c)   To ensure that the location of towers and wireless communications
facilities in the Village provide appropriate wireless communication coverage
consistent with these objectives.
   (d)   To allow, under certain conditions, appropriate Village-owned property
and structures to be used for wireless communications facilities.
   (e)   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and wireless
communications facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and
innovative camouflaging techniques.
   (f)   To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of towers and antenna
support structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers.
   (g)   To ensure towers and wireless communications facilities are soundly
and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer in use.
   (h)   To ensure to the maximum extent practicable that towers and wireless
communications facilities are compatible with surrounding and nearby land uses.
   (i)   To ensure to the maximum extent practicable that proposed towers and
wireless communications facilities are placed in locations that are designed to
preserve adjacent natural settings and in a manner consistent with existing and
planned development patterns.

1193.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Village of Granville lies in a valley and foothill landscape. Over time,
many trees have grown or been planted by residents in the community. These
trees, native and imported, provide beauty and protection from summer heat,
increase property values, enhance community pride, preserve wildlife habitat,
reduce air and noise pollution, and reduce soil erosion. Granville has earned
the designation as a “Tree City USA” in recognition of the Village’s unique
stewardship of this vital resource. Accordingly, the Village has determined
that it is necessary for the public health and welfare to conserve tree
resources by protecting trees from unnecessary destruction or removal,
encouraging the replacement of trees lost to disease, natural hazards, or human
intervention. The Village has also determined that street trees, park trees,
and other trees on public lands contribute to the quality of life in the
community. Chapter
1193 , Tree and Landscape Requirements, provides for the improvement and
maintenance of the appearance and safety of and the protection, preservation,
and promotion of the aesthetic appeal, character and value of the Village of
Granville. The intent of this chapter is to establish mechanisms and policies

1195.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of the Traffic Impact Study Ordinance is to promote the public
health, safety and welfare by ensuring adequate transportation facilities to
manage growth, development and redevelopment. The Traffic Impact Study
Ordinance is intended to establish fair and equitable requirements for roadway
infrastructure improvements for applicants seeking approvals for rezoning,
zoning variances, special permits, and preliminary subdivision plats for large-
scale projects. To further this intent, the Village has determined it to be
fitting to require the submission of an appropriate traffic study with each
application.
   The primary objectives of a traffic study are as follows:
   (a)   Provide a basis for assessing the transportation impacts of a new
development or expansion of an existing development; identify the need for any
improvements to the supporting roadway system to provide satisfactory levels of
service; and, to address safety issues.
   (b)   Address relevant transportation issues associated with development
proposals that may be of concern to neighboring residents, businesses, and
property owners.
   (c)   Determine the appropriate location, spacing, and design of the access
system for the proposed development in compliance with Village standards.
   (d)   Evaluate the internal circulation and connectivity systems of the
proposed development to provide safe and efficient internal traffic flow and
access to/from the adjacent and nearby roadway system.
   (e)   Allow compliance with the most current edition of the Village
Thoroughfare Plan (or other applicable thoroughfare plans).
   (f)   Provide a basis for improvement and funding discussions in conjunction
with zoning, special permit, and subdivision plat approvals.
      (Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.02 TRAFFIC STUDY WARRANTS.
   The need for either a detailed traffic impact study or a limited traffic
operations analysis will be identified when rezoning, variance, or plan
approval petitions are filed (or discussed with public officials). The Village
may also identify the need for a traffic impact study or operations analysis in
response to an access permit application.
   (a)   Study Warrants for a Traffic Impact Study: A complete traffic impact
study (TIS) will be requested for any proposed development or redevelopment
that meets one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   Significantly-sized project. A development meets this criterion if
it generates more than 10 trip ends (i.e., two-way vehicle-trips) during any
one hour of an average weekday. These trip ends shall be calculated using the
latest edition of Trip Generation as published by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers (or upon special studies of unique land-uses as
approved by the reviewers).
      (2)   Modifications to roadways. This criterion is met when the proposed
development is expected by the reviewers to significantly impact a roadway
segment, or roadway segments, identified in the Thoroughfare Plan and/or
improvement programs of the Village, Township, County, State, or other
jurisdictions. This criterion is also met when access for the proposed
development occurs on a public road that may be widened or improved in
accordance with adopted Thoroughfare Plans.
      (3)   Nearby congestion.  A development meets this criterion if the
proposed development is expected, in the opinion of Village staff, to
significantly impact surrounding roadways, intersections, or sets of
intersections which are already operating at level of service "D" or worse
during any hour (on a design day, or days, selected for analysis purposes). The
level of service will be determined by an analysis prescribed in the current
edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board) using
data that reflects the current traffic conditions.
      (4)   High traffic impact area. This criterion is met when, in the
opinion of Village staff, the proposed development is located in a high traffic
impact area. Such reflects special sensitivity to traffic condition changes due
to existing congestion, problematic circulation patterns, burgeoning traffic
operations problems, or other traffic conditions of special concern. A traffic
impact study will be requested for any proposed new development or
modifications to existing development within a high traffic impact area.
   (b)   Study Warrants for a Traffic Operations Analysis. A traffic operations
analysis will be requested for petitions which do not meet the warrants for a
detailed traffic impact study. A traffic operations analysis will be requested
for any one of the following conditions:
(1)   Requests for a driveway (or driveway modification) on any public road.
      (2)   Existing sight distance limitations or high accident experience
adjacent to the subject site.
      (3)   Modifications to a site plan for an existing development where the
parking layout and/or internal circulation system could affect traffic
operations on the external roadway system.
      (4)   Requests or probable need for a new traffic signal to control
driveways serving a proposed or existing development.
Examples of traffic operations analyses include studies of proposed driveway
locations, resulting sight distances, driveway and intersection geometry and
control, turn lane needs and design, accommodation of projected queuing
conditions, accident experience and safety, and traffic signal warrant and
progression analysis.
      (Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.03 PRE-MEETING AND MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.
   Prior to commencing the preparation of a Traffic Impact Study, the preparer
shall schedule a meeting with appropriate Village staff. Other participants in
this pre-meeting shall be representatives of other jurisdictions and agencies
as deemed appropriate by Village personnel. The participants at the meeting
shall identify and agree upon the following issues and needs prior to the
preparation of the TIS:
   (a)   Study area
   (b)   Study years
   (c)   Development phasing, if applicable
   (d)   Field data collection requirements
   (e)   Acceptable data associated with traffic volumes, accident history, and
signal operations
   (f)   Peak traffic hours (analysis hours)
   (g)   Trip generation, trip distribution, and assignment methods
   (h)   Applicable planning documents (including the Village’s Thoroughfare
Plan and Access Management Plan)
   (i)   Other traffic impact studies prepared for developments in the study
area
   (j)   Utilization of travel demand models
   (k)   Background traffic and growth factors
   (l)   Acceptable levels of service (LOS)
   (m)   Analyses methodology and software (capacity, signal warrants, etc.)
   (n)   Safety issues (sight distances, accident data, etc.)
   (o)   Committed and planned roadway improvements and schedule
   (p)   TIS submittal date
   The preparer shall submit a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which details
the assumptions and methodologies agreed upon regarding the items above – and
the preparer shall request Village staff concurrence with the contents of the
MOU. The MOU should be submitted to the Village within one-week subsequent to
the pre-meeting. The MOU will be approved by Village staff within one week of
receipt – assuming that all items are properly addressed.
(Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.04 PREPARER QUALIFICATIONS.
   Traffic Impact Studies shall be prepared by professionals with training and
experience in traffic engineering/transportation planning and under the
supervision of a registered professional engineer in Ohio with training and
experience in traffic engineering (operations and safety analysis experience).
The preparer shall not be a member of the TIS review team; neither shall the
preparer be related to a review team member nor hold a financial interest in
the project under study.
(Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.05 STUDY AREA.
   Any complete transportation study analyzing off-site access needs and impact
will include at least all site access points and major intersections
(signalized and unsignalized) adjacent to the site. Beyond this area, the
review team will determine any additional area to be included based on local or
site specific deficiencies, development size, traffic conditions, or local
policy potentially affected by the proposed development. The study area will
also encompass vacant parcels of land believed to impact the intersections
being analyzed so as to analyze the proposed project in the context of other
previously approved or anticipated developments in the surrounding area.
Generally, the study area must be large enough to encompass the critical
intersections to be analyzed. In high traffic impact areas, the study area may
include the entire zone in order to capture the cumulative impact of future
development within the area.
(Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.06 STUDY HORIZON YEARS.
   Beyond the assessment of current conditions, traffic impact studies are to
address conditions in the anticipated opening year of the proposed development
assuming full build-out and occupancy. If the proposed development is to be
implemented in phases, it may be appropriate to analyze each major phase (e.g.,
initial phase, an intermediate phase, and full project build-out) in order to
define the potential for staging defined roadway improvements/modifications.
   In certain circumstances, it may also be appropriate to assess traffic
conditions in a horizon year that is compatible with long-range planning for
the study area. Such analyses may be requested in order to confirm that near-
term roadway improvements/modifications are compatible with the long-term
thoroughfare plan for the area.
(Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.07 TIME PERIODS TO BE ANALYZED.
   For each defined horizon year, specific time periods are to be analyzed. In
most cases, only analyses of street peak hours will be required. However, land-
use classifications which experience their highest trip generation levels
during periods other than street peak hours may require analyses for such
periods to determine proper site access and turn lane storage requirements.
Examples of land-use classifications which typically have substantially higher
site trip generation peaks at times other than weekday street peak hours are:
shopping centers, discount stores, recreational uses (e.g., theaters, zoos,
theme parks, stadiums, and arenas), restaurants, schools, churches, and garden
centers.
   The analysis time period (and condition) should be discussed and designated
by the reviewers at the initial meeting. The objective is to designate the
design day(s) and time period(s) so as to cause evaluation of conditions during
the design hour or design hours. The selection of the proper design day and
hour is particularly important for a development which exhibits significant
seasonal variations in trip generation (such as shopping centers). Special
consideration must also be given to a development located in a zone that
experiences (or will experience) significant seasonal variations in traffic
volumes due to unique land uses.
   The design hour(s) to be used in a TIS will be discussed and designated by
the reviewers at the initial meeting. At a minimum, all studies must include
assessments of conditions during both the AM and PM peak commuter hours (unless
otherwise directed by Village staff).
(Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1195.08 DEVELOPMENT TO BE ANALYZED.
   The total anticipated transportation infrastructure requirements in the
study horizon year(s) are needed so that the Village can accurately evaluate
implications associated with the applicant's request for development approval.
However, the impacts and infrastructure needs will be assessed separately for
the baseline condition (horizon year development excluding site) and total
development (horizon year development including site).
   (a)   Site Development.  Development proposed to be located on the site
under study should be categorized by specific land-use type consistent with
classifications contained in the latest edition of Trip Generation (Institute
of Transportation Engineers). The proposed number of development (building)
units (e.g., gross square feet of building area, dwelling units, hotel rooms,
etc.) should be provided. Land area is insufficient to provide a basis for
analysis. If the proposed land use or density is inconsistent with the current
land use plan, comparison of the proposed land use and the land use plan
recommendation should be made using classifications contained in the Trip
Generation report.
   (b)   Non-Site Development within Study Area. The impacts of the anticipated
non site development should be assessed separately from those of the proposed
development to aid both the Village and the applicant in the determination of
sources of transportation infrastructure needs. All significant developments
within the study area that have been approved or are likely to occur by the
specific horizon years should be identified and incorporated into the study.
The land-use type and magnitude of the probable future developments in the
horizon years should be identified in conversations with staff of the Village
and other relevant public agencies.
   (c)   Non-Site Outside Study Area. In some cases, the Village may request
the applicant to specifically consider and include traffic generated by large
developments located outside the defined study area. In such cases, a TIS
prepared for the identified development will be provided to the applicant by
the Village to permit the inclusion of relevant traffic volumes within the
subject TIS. The applicant will not be required to undertake vehicle- trip
generation and trip distribution for developments outside the study area.
      (Ord. 05-05. Passed 3-2-05.)

            5.1.5.1.   Existing conditions (Item 5.1.1 above).
            5.1.5.2.   Background conditions (Item 5.1.2 above).
            5.1.5.3.   Total conditions on existing roadway system (Item 5.1.3
above).
         5.1.6.   Through an iterative process, identify improvements/
modifications that will mitigate the traffic impacts of the proposed
development; expand the Exhibit table in 5.1.5. above to show how the
improvements/modifications will mitigate the impacts by movement, approach leg,
and overall. Table 1 provides an example of the requested information and
format.
      5.1.7.   The minimum acceptable design level of service (LOS) in the
Village is “C”. At intersections, analyses should show an overall LOS of “C”
with no individual movement operating at less than “D” to be acceptable. If the
analyses of background conditions show that conditions with only non-site
traffic will result in a level of service below these criteria, the preparer
should document this finding and ascertain the level of improvement    needed
to maintain at least the base level of service once site traffic is added. In
other words, where unacceptable levels of service are calculated for background
conditions (Item 5.1.2 above), the applicant is responsible for only
maintaining the same level of service when site traffic is added to the roadway
element.
      5.1.8.   Provide a scaled concept sketch {'{'}Exhibit{'}'} illustrating
the improvements/modifications that properly mitigate the traffic impacts of
the proposed development. Suggested improvements/modifications must be
practical and acceptable to the appropriate agency/jurisdiction.
      5.1.9.   The computer printouts associated with all referenced capacity
analyses must be included in the Appendix.

warranted, define required lengths.
            5.2.1.1.   Left turn lanes should be provided at site driveways or
at unsignalized intersections in accordance with the following conditions:
                  5.2.1.1.1.   Per Graph 1, 2, or 3 (the left turn warrant
charts) contained in the ODOT State Highway Access Management Manual, or
                  5.2.1.1.2.   On major and minor arterial roadways with posted
speed limits greater than 40 mph, or
                  5.2.1.1.3.   On major collector roadways with posted speed
limits greater than 40 mph and more than 10 left turning vehicles during a
design hour.
            5.2.1.1.   Right turn lanes should be provided in accordance with
Graphs 4, 5, 6, or 7 (the right turn warrant charts) contained in the ODOT
State Highway Access Management Manual with the following exceptions:
                  5.2.1.2.1.   Right turn lanes are not required for right turn
volumes less than 10 vehicles during a design peak hour.
                  5.2.1.2.2.   Right turn lanes are not required when there are
less than 200 vehicles (during a design hour) in the approach or curb lane for
roadways with more than one approach lane.
            5.2.1.3.   Left or right turn lanes may also be provided when
deemed necessary for safety purposes by Village representatives.
            5.2.1.4.   The length of left and right turn lanes should be based
on the criteria contained in the ODOT Location and Design Manual or, where
appropriate, on the results of queuing analyses associated with the capacity
calculations.
         5.2.2.   Queue analyses; describe critical queue lengths and
provisions for proper storage lengths.
         5.2.3.   Sight distance analyses; define required sight distances and
necessary measures to yield the appropriate distances.
         5.2.4.   Warrant analyses for the installation of traffic signals if
such are recommended as a mitigating measure.
            5.2.4.1.   Signal Warrants as contained in the latest edition of
the Ohio Manual of Traffic Control Devices (OMUTCD) shall be used for any
formal request associated with the installation of a traffic signal.
            5.2.4.2.   If a signal is shown to be warranted in a horizon year,
but is not warranted on opening day, estimates shall be made regarding the year
that the signal may become warranted.
            5.2.4.3.   In general, the Village does not install a traffic
signal unless the criteria specified in Warrant 1 (Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume)
are met. Table 2 provides a general guideline associated with this warrant.
            5.2.4.4.   Any intersection that meets signal warrant thresholds
must also be evaluated in terms of location and spacing based on the standards
noted in the Village’s Access Management Standards, or the ODOT State Access
Management Manual if applicable, for the access category assigned by the
Village’s Thoroughfare Plan.
            5.2.4.5.   Signal warrant analyses may be conducted using projected
traffic volumes to identify the potential need for the installation of traffic
signals. However, traffic signals will not be installed unless: (1) the subject
intersection is unquestionably projected to meet warrants on opening day of the
development, or (2) actual counts at the intersection meet warrant thresholds.

Access Management Plan Guidelines and Standards
1196.01   Purpose and intent.
1196.02   Road access categories and characteristics.
1196.03   Driveway types.
1196.04   Driveway locations and spacing.
1196.05   Access management standards.
1196.06   Driveway geometrics and design.
1196.07   Driveway islands.
1196.08   Auxiliary turn lanes.
1196.09   Variance procedures for access requests.
1196.10   Use of access.
 
 
1196.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   Access Management is an efficient way of dealing with the problems
associated with traffic congestion and safety caused by motorists turning at
driveways and intersections. Congestion and the threat of accidents become
greater as the number of driveways and intersections increase and the distance
between them decreases. Without Access Management, roadways and intersections
can become dangerous.
   The Village of Granville has adopted an Access Management Plan based on the
following principles:
   •   To promote public safety by minimizing accidents.
   •   To improve the driving experience by increasing mobility and decreasing
delay.
   •   To provide necessary and safe access to property.
   •   To minimize costs by making more efficient use of existing and proposed
roads.
   All highways, roads and streets form a hierarchy according to the function
they theoretically should serve. They serve traffic mobility, land access, or
some combination of these two. Interstates and expressways are at the highest
level; their primary function is mobility, so they have the strictest access
controls. At the other end of the scale are local streets serving low traffic
volumes at low speeds over short distances. Their primary purpose is to give
frequent, direct access to adjacent land, so restrictions are minimal.
   Between these extremes are the classes of arterials and collectors that make
up the bulk of the system. They include many of the most important roadways in
the Granville area -- and they are often expected to perform multiple and
conflicting traffic services. They must serve both the demand for mobility and
the demand for land access.
   The Village has adopted an Access Management Plan that considers:
   (a)   Modifications to existing roadways to provide better access
management,
   (b)   Proper access management along all new roadways, and
   (c)   Proper management and design of the site access and circulation
systems associated with planned new developments.
   The following sets forth the guidelines associated with the location and
design of access points. Reference should also be made to Chapter
1176 “Transportation Corridor Overlay District” for access standards set forth
for properties located within these areas.
(Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.02 ROAD ACCESS CATEGORIES AND CHARACTERISTICS.
   The roadways located in Granville have been categorized according to their
functional and operational intent. The categories are based on maintaining the
roadway’s function in terms of capacity, traffic flow, property access, and
safety. The functional descriptions of the six basic categories are as follows:
   (a)   Category I: Designed and intended to provide mobility for high volumes
of traffic at high speeds over long distances. Highways in this category are
typically designed and intended to achieve a minimum posted speed of 55 mph.
All interstate and freeway facilities are included in this category.
   (b)   Category II: Designed and intended to provide mobility for relatively
high    speed, high volume, and long distance through traffic. Highways in this
category are typically designed and intended to achieve a minimum posted speed
of 50 mph in areas without signals and 45 mph in areas with signals. This
category includes arterials of state-wide significance and this is the highest
category allowing at-grade intersections.
   (c)   Category III: Designed to provide mobility at moderate to high speeds
and volumes. Typically, Category III highways provide for a minimum posted
speed of 45 mph in areas without signals and a minimum of 35 mph in areas with
signals. Arterials outside the urban area are included in this category.
   (d)   Category IV: Designed and intended to provide access and mobility at
moderate to high speeds and volumes for moderate to short distances in rural
areas and low to medium speeds and volumes in urban areas. Low to moderate
speed arterials within the urban area and major collectors are included in this
category. Typically, Category IV highways provide for a minimum posted speed of
35 to 55 mph in undeveloped areas and 25 to 45 mph in developed areas.
   (e)   Category V: This category applies to roads and streets designed and
intended to take traffic from local roads, carry it a short distance, and
distribute it to higher category roadways. Minor collectors and neighborhood
collectors are included in this category. Typical posted speeds are 25 to 35
mph.
   (f)   Category VI: This category applies to local streets that provide
access to individual properties that abut the street.
      (Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.03 DRIVEWAY TYPES.
   (a)   A driveway is a point of access connecting an adjacent property to a
public roadway. There are five types of driveways, as follows:
      (1)   Farm or Field Drives: A driveway providing access to an
agricultural tract of land.
      (2)   SF Residential: A driveway providing access to a single-family
residence.
      (3)   Residential: A driveway providing access to multiple single-family
residences or to multi-family dwelling units.
      (4)   Commercial: A driveway providing access to an office, business,
commercial, or institutional building or buildings, or to an industrial
facility (that services fewer than ten trucks per day).
      (5)   Industrial/Retail: A driveway serving a retail center (such as a
community shopping center) or an industrial facility (that services ten or more
trucks per day).
   (b)   For Access Management purposes, driveways are also classified by
traffic volumes as follows:
      (1)   Low Volume Driveway (LVD): greater than 5 and up to 100 two-way
vehicle-trips in one or more 60-minute periods of a day.
      (2)   Medium Volume Driveway (MVD): greater than 100 and up to 200 two-
way vehicle-trips in one or more 60-minute periods of a day.
      (3)   High Volume Driveway (HVD): greater than 200 two-way vehicle-trips
in one or more 60-minute periods of a day.
         (Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.04 DRIVEWAY LOCATIONS AND SPACING.
   (a)   The number of driveways afforded any one site shall be minimized. (The
need for more than one driveway must be substantiated by a Traffic Impact
Study).
   (b)   Access for multiple properties shall be combined, where feasible.
   (c)   Driveways shall be located in accordance with applicable sight
distance requirements (Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) and Intersection Sight
Distance (ISD) as contained in Section 200 of the ODOT Location and Design
Manual).
   (d)   Minimum driveway spacing – based on posted speed limits -- shall be
determined using the values for high speed roadways (greater than 40 mph) and
low speed roadways (equal to or less than 40 mph) as follows:
 
High Speed Road Low Speed Road
Posted Minimum  Posted Minimum
Speed  Distance Speed  Distance
45 mph 500 ft.  25 mph 150 ft.
50 mph 550 ft.  30 mph 200 ft.
55 mph 600 ft.  35 mph 250 ft.
                40 mph 325 ft.
   (e)   Driveway spacing shall consider the location of driveways on both
sides of a roadway.
   (f)   Driveways shall be located where they will not cause problems with
movements to and from an existing or planned street, highway, or driveway on
the opposite side of the roadway.
   (g)   Driveways shall be located a sufficient distance from an adjacent
public road intersection so as not to interfere with the traffic operations at
the intersection. The following table provides the minimum acceptable distances
between drive locations and adjacent intersections. For all access categories,
where two roads of different access levels intersect, the restrictions and
distances of the higher level roadway will apply along the lower classified
roadway. (The defined distances are measured from the centerline of the
intersecting road to the centerline of the proposed driveway).
      Recommended Drive Distances from Intersection by Classification
 
Higher Roadway Classification               Distance from Intersection

1196.05 ACCESS MANAGEMENT STANDARDS.
This section defines the standards and specifications to be used in conjunction
with the access categories and driveway types to protect the functional
integrity of roads in and near the Village. The following describes the access
standards to be applied for each access category.
   Category I and II Roadways: Reference the latest version of the ODOT State
Highway Access Management Manual.

        MVD      Yes (c)    SSD/ISD             Stop                All (e)
        LVD      Yes (c)    SSD/ISD             Stop                All (e)
   HVD = High Volume Drive, MVD = Medium Volume Drive,
LVD = Low Volume Drive
SSD/ISD = Stopping Sight Distance and Intersection Sight Distance
   (a)   These are desirable minimum distances. It is recognized that site
frontage and property limits may, by necessity, alter these dimensions. At the
same time, the Village reserves the right to call for greater spacing
distances.
   (b)   Spacing requirements shall properly consider driveways on both sides
of the highway.
   (c)   One direct private access shall be permitted per parcel or contiguous
parcels under common ownership. Additional access may be permitted if:
      (1)    The access will not adversely affect the safety and operation of
the highway,
      (2)   Such access is necessary for the safe and efficient use of the
property, and
      (3)   Such access will not adversely affect access to adjacent or nearby
properties.
   (d)   ½ mile is recommended, however, ¼ mile may be allowed when there is no
reasonable alternative access to the general street system. If these cannot be
achieved, then the restrictions of SSD, ISD, and minimum spacing based on
posted speed limit shall apply
   (e)   All movements permitted if not deemed detrimental; certain movements
by be restricted due to operational and safety considerations.
   (f)   Spacing shall be determined using the greatest value identified for
SSD, ISD, and minimum driveway spacing based on posted speed limit (reference
table in Section
1196.04(d)).
   (g)   Low volume driveways shall be discouraged on roadways with speed
limits greater than 50 mph. Where there is an opportunity, low volume drives
should be consolidated and combined using appropriate means such as service
roads, cross easements, and joint access to reduce the number of access points.
   (h)   ¼ mile is recommended, however, one-eighth mile may be allowed when
there is no reasonable alternative access to the general street system. If
these cannot be achieved, then the restrictions of SSD, ISD, and minimum
spacing based on posted speed limit shall apply.
   
   Category VI Roadways: Full access permitted per parcel or lot.
(Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.06 DRIVEWAY GEOMETRICS AND DESIGN.
   (a)   Driveway widths and turning radii are determined by the number and use
of lanes on the driveway and the design vehicle chosen for the driveway. The
width and radii of the driveway shall permit vehicles to enter and exit with a
minimum of interference to through traffic, yet be restrictive enough to
discourage erratic maneuvers. The following table provides guidelines for
driveway dimensions based on driveway type and design vehicle.
            
 
Driveway Type    Residential   Commercial    Industrial/Retail
Design Vehicle   P             SU-30         WB-50/WB-67
Nominal Width 1/ Min.   Max.   Min.   Max.   Min.   Max.
                 (feet) (feet) (feet) (feet) (feet) (feet)
One-way Drive    10     14     14     20     14     26
Two-way Drive    20     24     26     32     26     38
Corresponding    25     15     35     25     75     50
RT Radius
   1/ Driveway throat width measured parallel to highway and clear of the turn
radii.
      P: Passenger car
      SU-30: Single-unit truck; 30 feet in length
      WB-50: Large semi-trailer truck; 55 feet in length
      WB-67: Interstate semi-trailer truck; 74 feet in length
RT Radius: Right turn radius (Note: the smaller the drive width, the larger
turn    radius required to accommodate the path of the vehicle.)
   (b)   Driveways that enter a public roadway at traffic signals shall have
the number of lanes as determined by a capacity analysis. In this case, 12-foot
wide lanes shall be utilized and turn templates shall be used to ensure
adequate radius-throat width combinations.
   (c)   Two-way driveways shall intersect the highway at an intersection angle
between 70º and 90º. An angle less than 70º will not be permitted on new two-
way driveways. One-way operation driveways (right in only or right out only)
shall not have an angle less than 45º.
   (d)   Driveway radii may be reduced on a roadway with on-street parking. The
turn radius, in such a case, is measured from the edge of the through lane.
   (e)   The profile of a driveway shall be designed to provide a smooth
transition for its users.
   (f)   Drives shall not be obstructed within the right-of-way by gates, or
similar obstacles. Any access with a gate shall be designed so that the longest
vehicle can completely clear the traveled way when the gate is closed and as it
is opened.
   (g)   The need for traffic signals shall be determined by warrant analyses
using the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
   (h)   High volume driveways that do not meet signal warrants may be denied
certain traffic movements if traffic volumes and conditions on the highway
would make the full movement operation unsafe. (Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.07 DRIVEWAY ISLANDS.
   In some situations, it is desirable to prohibit certain movements through
the use of median or channelizing islands. Median islands can be used to
separate inbound and outbound traffic. It is a curbed island which prevents
egressing traffic from encroaching on the side of the drive used by ingress
traffic. Channelizing islands further designate the correct turning path and
define the merge area thus reducing conflicting movements. The geometry shall
physically define the permitted movements and block the prohibited movements.
   (a)   Median islands (such as those illustrated in Figures 1 and 2)) shall
be at least 4    feet wide -- with a maximum of 6 feet at the intersection.
Median widths exceeding 6 feet are undesirable because they create turning
problems, expand the intersection, and make it difficult to provide proper lane
alignments with opposing existing or future driveways or roadways.
   (b)   Median islands shall be at least 25 feet in length.
   (c)   An island median shall be used to prevent encroachment on other
driveway lanes whenever any combination of egress and ingress lanes exceeds
three lanes.
   (d)   A median island shall be offset at least 12 feet from the edge of the
traveled lane on the main road.
   (e)   The nose of a median island shall taper in height from 2” to 6” over a
distance of 4 feet.
   (f)   Standard yellow edge lines shall be used at the divisional island.
Also, white pavement markings shall be used to delineate traffic lanes when
there are two or more lanes in the same direction. At high volume driveways,
reflectorized pavement markers should be used to provide greater delineation.
   (g)   Channelizing islands shall be used on arterials and network collectors
without a median where left turns are restricted and on one-way streets to
discourage wrong way turns.
   (h)   Channelizing islands shall have a surface area of at least 75 square
feet.
   (i)   All channelizing islands (such as those illustrated in Figures 3, 4,
and 5) shall be offset at least 4 feet from the edge of the traveled lane to
the face of curb or the width of the paved curbed shoulder whichever is greater
on high-speed roadways or where the approach roadway is uncurbed. A mountable
curb, no more than 4 inches high, should be used on the channelizing island if
approach roadways are uncurbed.
   (j)   A turning radius of between 75 feet and 100 feet shall be used for
channelizing islands in order to make it more difficult for a driver to make a
maneuver which the design is intended to discourage. (Radii larger than 100
feet should not be used on egress unless an acceleration lane is provided
because of the large angle a driver must rotate in order to see vehicles
approaching from the left; the acceleration lane allows the driver to use the
rear view mirror to select a gap).
   (k)   Figures 1 through 5 provide general design guidelines for median and
channelizing islands. They primarily relate to commercial and industrial/retail
driveways and they depict 90º T-type intersections. Applicable driveway widths
and turning radii shall be determined based on the number and use of lanes on
the driveway and the design vehicle chosen for the driveway. The depicted
signage references the regulatory signs defined in the Ohio Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (OMUTCD).
      (Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.08 AUXILIARY TURN LANES.
   The requirement for separate left and/or right turn lanes on the main
roadway at site access points shall be based on the following guidelines:
   (a)   Left turn lanes shall be provided in accordance with the following
conditions:
      (1)   Per Graph 1, 2, or 3 (the left turn warrant charts) contained in
the ODOT State Highway Access Management Manual, or
      (2)   On major and minor arterial roadways with posted speed limits
greater than 40 mph, or
      (3)   On network collector roadways with posted speed limits greater than
40 mph and more than 10 left turning vehicles during a design hour.
   (b)   Right turn lanes shall be provided in accordance with Graphs 4, 5, 6,
or 7 (the right turn warrant charts) contained in the ODOT State Highway Access
Management Manual with the following exceptions:
      (1)   Right turn lanes are not required for right turn volumes of less
than 10 vehicles during a design peak hour.
      (2)   Right turn lanes are not required when there are less than 200
vehicles (during a design hour) in the approach or curb lane for roadways with
more than one approach lane.
   (c)   Left or right turn lanes may also be required when deemed necessary
for safety purposes by Village representatives.
   (d)   The length of left and right turn lanes shall be based on the criteria
contained in the ODOT Location and Design Manual or, where appropriate, on the
results of queuing analyses associated with the capacity calculations contained
in the applicable traffic impact study.
      (Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.09 VARIANCE PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS REQUESTS.
   An access variance grants permission to depart from the standards and
requirements of the Access Management Plan based on unique circumstances or
existing special conditions.
   (a)   The request for a variance shall specify, in writing, why the variance
is appropriate and necessary and shall document the unique conditions or
special circumstances that make it impractical and infeasible to meet the
applicable standards and/or requirements of the Access Management Plan. The
documentation shall show that the applicant has considered all practical and
reasonable alternatives to mitigate the unique conditions or special
circumstances, that the alternatives are not feasible or practical, and that,
without the variance, the applicant will be deprived of reasonable access.
   (b)   In considering a request for a variance, the Village shall determine
if:
      (1)   The variance meets minimum applicable State, County, or Village
standards including geometric design, operation, and safety elements – and if
the variance is shown to be beneficial to the traveling public.
      (2)   The variance is not detrimental to the public health, safety, and
welfare.
      (3)   The variance does not degrade the planned or intended operation of
the roadway system.
   (c)   A variance approval shall be consistent with the guiding principles of
the Access Management Plan.
   (d)   When a variance is granted, the documentation of the reason(s) for
approving the variance shall be included in the records and files pertaining to
the permit.
   (e)   When an applicant objects to the denial of a variance request, the
applicant may file an appeal within thirty days of the notice of the denial of
the variance. The written appeal shall include reasons for the appeal and may
include changes, revisions, or conditions that would be acceptable to the
applicant.
   (f)   Within thirty days of the filing of an appeal, the Village shall
determine whether the denial of the variance is justified. The applicant shall
be notified of the final decision. (Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)
1196.10 USE OF ACCESS.
   It is the responsibility of the property owner to ensure that the use of the
access to the property is not in violation of the permit terms and conditions.
The terms and conditions of any permit are binding upon all assigns,
successors-in-interest, heirs, and occupants. If any changes are made or will
be made in the use of the property, which will affect access operation, traffic
volume, or vehicle type, the applicant or property owner shall contact the
Village to determine if a new access permit and modifications to the access
point are required.
(Ord. 04-05. Passed 3-2-05.)

1197.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible and
economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level of
storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to property
and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Granville:
   (a)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Granville to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Granville's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1197.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Licking County, and the
Village of Granville shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1199 Erosion and Sediment Control. (Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.02 DEFINITIONS.

   (b)   AS-BUILT SURVEY: A survey shown on a plan or drawing prepared by a
Registered Surveyor indicating the actual dimensions, elevations, and locations
of any structures, underground utilities, swales, detention facilities, and
sewage treatment facilities after construction has been completed.
   (c)   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): Schedule of activities, prohibitions
of practices, operation and maintenance procedures, treatment requirements, and
other practices to reduce the pollution of water resources and to control storm
water volume and rate.
   (d)   CLEAN WATER ACT: Pub. L. 92-500, as amended Pub. L. 95-217, Pub. L.
95-576, Pub. L. 96-483, Pub. L. 97-117, and Pub. L. 100-4, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et.
seq. Referred to as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972.
   (e)   COMMUNITY: The Village of Granville, its designated representatives,
boards, or commissions.
   (f)   COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN: The written document and
plans meeting the requirements of this regulation that set forth the plans and
practices to minimize storm water runoff from a development area, to safely
convey or temporarily store and release post-development runoff at an allowable
rate to minimize flooding and stream bank erosion, and to protect or improve
storm water quality and stream channels.
   (g)   CRITICAL STORM: A storm that is calculated by means of the percentage
increase in volume of runoff by a proposed development area. The critical storm
is used to calculate the maximum allowable storm water discharge rate from a
developed site.
   (h)   DETENTION FACILITY: A basin, pond, oversized pipe, or other structure
that reduces the peak flow rate of storm water leaving the facility by
temporarily storing a portion of the storm water entering the facility.
   (i)   DEVELOPMENT AREA: A parcel or contiguous parcels owned by one person
or persons, or operated as one development unit, and used or being developed
for commercial, industrial, residential, institutional, or other construction
or alteration that changes runoff characteristics.
   (j)   DEVELOPMENT DRAINAGE AREA: A combination of each hydraulically unique
watershed with individual outlet points on the development area.
   (k)   DISTURBED AREA: An area of land subject to erosion due to the removal
of vegetative cover and/or soil disturbing activities.
   (l)   DRAINAGE: The removal of excess surface water or groundwater from land
by surface or subsurface drains.
   (m)   EROSION: The process by which the land surface is worn away by the
action of wind, water, ice, gravity, or any combination of those forces.
   (n)   EXTENDED CONVEYANCE: A storm water management practice that replaces
and/or enhances traditional open or closed storm drainage conduits by retarding
flow, promoting percolation of runoff into the soil, and filtering pollutants
during the storm water quality event.
   (o)   EXTENDED DETENTION: A storm water management practice that replaces
and/or enhances traditional detention facilities by releasing the runoff
collected during the storm water quality event over at least 24 to 48 hours,
retarding flow and allowing pollutants to settle within the facility.
   (p)   FINAL STABILIZATION: All soil disturbing activities at the site have
been completed and a uniform perennial vegetative cover with a density of at
least 80% coverage for the area has been established or equivalent
stabilization practices, such as the use of mulches or geotextiles, have been
employed.
   (q)   GRADING: The process in which the topography of the land is altered to
a new slope.
   (r)   IMPERVIOUS COVER: Any surface that cannot effectively absorb or
infiltrate water. This may include roads, streets, parking lots, rooftops,
sidewalks, and other areas not covered by vegetation.
   (s)   INFILTRATION: A storm water management practice that does not
discharge to a water resource during the storm water quality event, requiring
collected runoff to either infiltrate into the groundwater and/or be consumed
by evapotranspiration, thereby retaining storm water pollutants in the
facility.

   (w)   NONSTRUCTURAL STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Storm water runoff
control and treatment techniques that use natural practices to control runoff
and/or reduce pollution levels.
   (x)   POST-DEVELOPMENT: The conditions that exist following the completion
of soil disturbing activity in terms of topography, vegetation, land use, and
the rate, volume, quality, or direction of storm water runoff.
   (y)   PRE-CONSTRUCTION MEETING: Meeting prior to construction between all
parties associated with the construction of the project including government
agencies, contractors and owners to review agency requirements and plans as

1197.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General:  The storm water system, including storm water management
practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall
be designed to prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm
event; to maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to
meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The storm water management practices shall function as an integrated system
that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical,
biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving storm water
discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
Storm water management practices that meet the criteria in this regulation, and
additional criteria required by the Village Engineer shall comply with this
regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Storm water management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1117, Design Standards, shall provide storm water management for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Storm water facilities in water resources: Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state,
and local agencies as required in Section
1197.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1199, Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Storm water ponds and surface conveyance channels: All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1197.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing storm water
management practice, or if the storm water management requirements for the site
are provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by
the Village Engineer as detailed in Section
1197.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of Granville,
storm water management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be
on a separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if
compensated by the property owners, by the Village of Granville. Storm water
management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining unconcentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream relocation or enclosure: The Village Engineer may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
 1197.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1199, Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site storm water discharges:  Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other storm water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour
storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Village of Granville zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Village
Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems
when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed
development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the
development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Full headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or
outlets to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of Granville:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Full headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or storm water management practice such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and
does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year
water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot
below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of Granville
must be compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material. For all areas
of development that do not increase the floodplain storage by 1/10th of the
floodplain elevation there shall be no compensatory flood storage requirement.
First consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes
should be given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to
the new floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration
will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to
compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the
contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the Village of Granville,
reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal
boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage
areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed
area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to a BMP: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following storm water management practices. These
practices are listed in Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to
meet the following general performance standards:
         A.   Extended conveyance facilities that slow the rate of storm water
runoff; filter and biodegrade pollutants in storm water; promote infiltration
and evapotranspiration of storm water; and discharge the controlled runoff to a
water resource.
         B.   Extended detention facilities that detain storm water; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled storm water to a
water resource.
         C.   Infiltration facilities that retain storm water; promote
settling, filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured
storm water into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil
engineering report to be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed
infiltration facilities meet these performance standards.
         D.   The Village Engineer may approve other BMPs if the applicant
demonstrates to the Village Engineer satisfaction that these BMPs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1197.09(c)(6).
      (2)   Criteria applying to all storm water management practices.
Practices chosen must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) and to
ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed best management practices
controlling the amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-
term hourly records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                WQv = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
                C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
                      1"
                P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                A = area draining into the storm water practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume are listed in Table 1.
Alternatively, the Village Engineer may consider use of the following equation
to calculate the runoff coefficient if the applicant can demonstrate that
appropriate controls are in place to limit the proposed impervious area of the
development:
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff
                                                   Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (> 8 dwellings/acre)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (< 4 dwellings/acre)       0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the storm water practice for sediment storage.
         C.   Storm water quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.

* Size to pass a hydrograph with a volume equal to the WQv, a duration of
2 hours, and peak rainfall intensity of 1 inch/hour at a depth of no more
than 3 inches. The use of this criterion is limited to sites where the
total area disturbed is 5 acres or less.
**Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv .
 
 
         D.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility fall within hydrologic soil groups A or B, and if the seasonal high
water table and any underlying bedrock are at least six feet below the final
grade elevation.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through an extended conveyance facility to remove coarser sediments that could
cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than 3 feet below the final grade elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a 2.5 foot deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability equivalent
to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         C.   Facilities designed according to the flow through design drain
time shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where the total area disturbed is 5
acres or less.
            2.   Be designed to slow and filter runoff flowing through the turf
grasses with a maximum depth of flow no greater than 3 inches.
         D.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow before
entering an extended conveyance facility designed according to the flow through
drain time.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities: 
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to release the bottom 50 percent of
the water quality volume in no less than 2/3rd of the drain time. A valve shall
be provided to drain any permanent pool volume for removal of accumulated
sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, and
maintenance.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hearty plants comparable to wetland vegetation that
are able to withstand prolonged inundation.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay volume shall be equal to at
least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
      (6)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities shall be lined with fine turf-forming, flood tolerant
grasses.
         B.   Facilities designed according to the extended detention design
drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than 3 feet below the final grade elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a 2.5 foot deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability equivalent
to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         C.   Swales and filter strips designed according to the flow through
drain time shall:
            1.   Only be allowed on sites where the total area disturbed is 5
acres or less.

grasses with a maximum depth of flow no greater than 3 inches.
         D.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow before
entering an extended conveyance facility designed according to the flow through
drain time.
      (7)   Alternative post-construction BMPs: The applicant may request
approval from the Village Engineer for the use of alternative structural post-
construction BMPs, if the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the Village
Engineer and with prior written approval from Ohio EPA, that these BMPs are
equivalent in pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness
to those listed in Table 2.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control:  The Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management
practices are designed to meet the following requirements for storm water
quantity control for each watershed in the development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method that
generates hydrographs, or other hydrologic method approved by the Village
Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm
occurring on the development drainage area before and after development. These
calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use.
            4.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
1197.09(d)(3)A., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
 Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm:
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Storm Water Management on Redevelopment Projects:  Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing site
impervious areas by at least 20 percent. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, then stormwater management practices shall be
implemented to provide storm water quality control facilities for at least 20
percent of the site's impervious area. When a combination of impervious area
reduction and storm water quality control facilities is used, the combined area
shall equal or exceed 20 percent of the site. Where conditions prevent
impervious area reduction or on-site stormwater management for redevelopment
projects, practical alternatives as detailed in Section
1197.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village of Granville determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used
that result in an improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water
quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of storm water quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the drainage area of the proposed development
project to the maximum extent practicable.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the Village of Granville to be
applied to community-wide storm water management practices.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices and/or
the retrofit of an existing practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to storm water control such as wetland complexes.
           (Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to storm water management practices as required by the Village
Engineer for inspections and maintenance shall be secured by easements. The
following conditions shall apply to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village of Granville prior to
approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Licking County Recorder
and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all storm water management practices shall be
no less than 25-feet wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire
practice plus an additional 25-foot wide band around the perimeter of the storm
water management practice.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural storm water management practices shall be
restricted against the construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and
other structures that may obstruct the free flow of storm water and the passage
of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final
grade from that described by the final grading plan approved by the Village of
Granville. Any re-grading and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance
easement may be removed by the Village of Granville at the property owners'
expense.
      (Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed and provided to the Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent storm water
management practices must be installed and made functional, as determined by
the Village Engineer and per the approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including a Survey and Inspection, must be
sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional Surveyor
with a statement certifying that the storm water management practices, as
designed and installed, meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan approved by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this
certification, the Village Engineer may require the submission of a new set of
storm water practice calculations if he/she determines that the design was
altered significantly from the approved Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan. The As-Built Survey must provide the location, dimensions, and bearing of
such practices and include the entity responsible for long-term maintenance as
detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement as specified in Section
 1197.08 must be provided to the Village Engineer
      (Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The Village of Granville shall inspect storm water management practices
periodically. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance, the
Village of Granville shall provide written notification to the responsible
party, as detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for
maintenance. Upon notification, the responsible party shall have ten (10)
working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a
plan with detailed action items and established timelines. Should repairs not
be made within this time, or a plan approved by the Village Engineer for these
repairs not be in place, the Village of Granville may undertake the necessary
repairs and assess the responsible party.
(Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.14 FEES.
   The Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village of Granville before the review process begins. The Village Engineer
shall establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for
providing these services.
(Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a surety
bond of 100% of the total stormwater management project cost, has been
deposited with the Village of Granville Finance Department. This surety bond
shall be posted for the Village of Granville to perform the obligations
otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as stated in
this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in the event
that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation. The
stormwater bond will be returned, less Village of Granville administrative fees
as detailed in Section
1135.01, Zoning Fees of the Village of Granville Codified Ordinances, when the
following three criteria are met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As Built Inspection of all water quality practices is conducted
by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   A Inspection and Maintenance Agreement signed by the developer, the
contractor, the Village of Granville, and the private owner or homeowners
association, who will take long term responsibility for these BMPs, is accepted
by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village of Granville may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues
with all storm water management structures on the site and the remainder of the
bond shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the
purpose of long term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures, or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within 2 days.
(Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.17 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated any of
the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made
pursuant to this regulation, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of any
lands in violation of this regulation or in violation of any permit granted
under this regulation. (Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.18 APPEALS FROM DECISIONS.

   (c)   A person who intends to appear at the appeal hearing as an appellee
may file with the Clerk additional parts of the record at any time before the
hearing.
(Ord. 23-2010. Passed 12-15-10.)
1197.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person, firm, entity or corporation; including but not limited to,
the owner of the property, his agents and assigns, occupant, property manager,
and any contractor or subcontractor who violates or fails to comply with any
provision of this regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree and
shall be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for no
more than sixty (60) days, or both, for each offense. A separate offense shall

1199.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-Structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
        Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the    most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village of Granville Engineer,
is required for any one of the following conditions, as determined in Table 3
below:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.   10-acres of disturbed drainage.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 67 cubic
yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area and have a
minimum of 48-hour drain time for sediment basins serving a drainage area over
5 acres.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
         A.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000 feet, three
(3) per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
prediction model. When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-
site areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The
configuration between the inlets and the outlet of the basin must provide at
least two units of length for each one unit of width (>2:1 length: width
ratio), however a length to width ration of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must
be removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been
reduced by 40 percent. This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies
one-half of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling    ponds, the
applicant must consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as
a design factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must
be used where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a
combination of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve
maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 >2% but < 20%
0.125                                >20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
Based on site conditions, the Village of Granville Engineer may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust.
            These additional BMPs may include:
            1.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the
perimeter of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
            2.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas
must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or
to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1199.09(g) of this regulation.
            3.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village of Granville Engineer may
require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas,
tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation
of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch    basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage
area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all containers in
the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)    Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternately, sediment may
be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter bag or
comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain sediment or
other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. However,
care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it does not
become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other pollutant
sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections.  All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the Village of Granville Engineer and all of the following conditions are
met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of Granville or an
alternate form acceptable to the Village of Granville Engineer. The inspection
form shall include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            5.   Locations of:
               a.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               b.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
               c.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               d.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            6.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         D.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years, following final
stabilization, the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications
of personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major
observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to
whether the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any
incidents of non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Village of Granville Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
      (4)   Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village of Granville Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site.

   (a)    Purpose. Recognizing the continual need for recreational facilities
within the Municipality and conforming this need to the growth of population

shall be placed in a separate fund to be entitled Park Land Reserve Fund.
   (c)    Prerequisite to Final Plat Approval. The owner or proprietor of each
new subdivision for the purpose of transfer of ownership of land, as a
prerequisite to the approval of the final plat of the subdivision, shall pay a
public use fee, in addition to other fees, into the Park Land Reserve Fund of
the Municipality as follows:
(Ord. 05-96. Passed 5-15-96.)
      (1)    For each lot shown on the plat of the subdivision for single
family residence use, the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00); and
      (2)    For each lot intended for multi-dwelling use, the sum of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for each dwelling unit of a multi-dwelling structure
permitted to be constructed thereon under applicable regulations of the Zoning

   (d)    Prerequisite to Zoning Permit Issuance. The owner or proprietor of

hundred dollars ($500.00); and

nonresidential unit a public use fee computed at a rate of two thousand dollars
($2,000) per acre, provided that such fee shall not be less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) per unit.
         (Ord. 23-2024. Passed 11-20-24.)
   (e)    Fee Already Paid. No owner or developer of land shall be required to
pay the public use fee as established in subsection (d) hereof for construction
upon or development of any parcel of land for which a public use fee has been
paid pursuant to the terms of subsection (c) hereof.
   (f)    Land Dedication in Lieu of Fee. In lieu of the payment of the public
use fee hereinbefore provided, the Manager, upon recommendation of the Planning
Commission, may accept the dedication for public use of open spaces
constituting a reasonable proportion of the gross acreage of land subdivided
for the purpose of transfer of ownership or of land for which a zoning permit
has been requested, provided that such open spaces are suitably located and of
adequate size to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare, and
further provided that in no event shall the aggregate value of such dedicated
land be less than the equivalent public use fee otherwise payable and computed
in accordance with this section.
   (g)    Fee Waived. Council, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission,
may waive the public use fee for schools, churches and/or other community
oriented facilities.
   (h)    Use of Park Land Reserve Fund. All such moneys in the Park Land
Reserve Fund shall be used for the acquisition, development, maintenance and
operation of publicly owned recreation sites and facilities including, but not
limited to, park sites, area recreational facilities and community recreation
centers within the Municipality.
   (i)    Appropriation of other Funds. During the period of time that the fee
levied by this section is collected, Council shall appropriate annually from
the General Fund a sum not less than equal to the moneys derived from this
section for park and recreational purposes which may include funds appropriated
for park and recreation capital improvements. The Finance Director is directed
to create a Park Land Reserve Fund and is further directed at the close of each
year that the public use fee herein collected, to transfer to the Park Land
Reserve Fund from General Fund moneys a sum of money equal to the amount of
money collected from the public use fee after deducting expenditures during the
year for park and recreation purposes made from the General Fund money. It is
the intention of Council that during each year that the public use fee is in
force that an amount equal to the fee moneys received from the public use fee
shall be irrevocably committed to park and recreation purposes from other
Municipal fund sources of the Municipality.

unit in the Municipality shall be issued unless and until the fee provided for

the zoning permit for the construction of a residential or nonresidential unit
in the Municipality unless and until the fee provided in this section is paid

reliving any person, firm or corporation from complying with all other
ordinances, laws, rules, or regulations of the Municipality or of any other
governmental agency where they are now in force or hereafter enacted,
regulating and governing the issuance of zoning permits for the construction of
residential or nonresidential unit in the Municipality.
