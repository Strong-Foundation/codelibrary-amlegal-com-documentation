   (a)   Common and Technical Usage. Words and phrases shall be read in context
and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. Words and
phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly. (ORC 1.42)
   (b)   Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense. As used in the Codified
Ordinances, unless the context otherwise requires:
      (1)   The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the

      (3)   Words in the present tense include the future. (ORC 1.43)
   (c)   Calendar; Computation of Time.
      (1)   Definitions.
         A.   “Week” means seven consecutive days.
         B.   “Year” means twelve consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month. (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that, when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, the act may be done on the
next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
When a public office in which an act, required by law, is to be performed is
closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last day for doing
the act or before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may be
performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
If any legal holiday falls on Sunday, the next succeeding day is a legal
holiday. (ORC 1.14)
      (4)   When legislation is to take effect or become operative from and
after a day named, no part of that day shall be included. (ORC 1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.
   (d)   Authority. When the law requires an act to be done which may by law as
well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by unauthorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three
or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such
authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall be
otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended. (ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactment or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there Is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provision is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

147.14 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PLAN.
   The Village Council has declared the necessity to adopt an equal employment
opportunity plan as follows:
   (a)   Purpose: To describe the Village of Newcomerstown's Equal Employment
Opportunity Plan.
      (1)   The Village abides by, and supports, all elements of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Act. The Village ensures equal opportunities for
employment and employment conditions for minority persons and women.
      (2)   Annually, the Mayor, in cooperation with the Fiscal Officer, is to
analyze the Villages's existing employment policies, practices and procedures
relevant to their effective impact on the employment and utilization of
minorities and women.
   (b)   Equal Employment Opportunity Section.
      (1)   The Village is an equal employment opportunity employer. It is the
policy of the Village not to unlawfully discriminate against any qualified
employee, qualified applicant for employment, or eligible beneficiary of
services on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
disability, or veteran's status regarding the following:
         A.   Recruitment;
         B.   Selection;
         C.   Placement;
         D.   Testing;
         E.   Training;
         F.   Promotions and transfers;
         G.   Layoff and recall;
         H.   Termination their actions;
         I.   Disciplinary action in regard to affording equal opportunities to
each Village employee or job;
         J.   Social and recreational programs applicant; and
         K.   Employee benefits and compensation.
      (2)   An employee who feels he or she has been discriminated against
because of race, creed, color, sex, age, national origin, or other non-merit
factors or physical/mental disability may seek redress internally by filing a
complaint with the employee's supervisor or the Mayor. If the employee's
supervisor or the Mayor is the source of the alleged discrimination, the
complaint may be filed with the Village Solicitor. If the complaint is not
addressed through the internal grievance procedure, an employee may file a
charge with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission as appropriate.
      (3)   The Village shall make reasonable accommodations for qualified
individuals as required by regulations issued under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
      (4)   In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Village
has named the Mayor as an ADA Coordinator who will conduct a self-evaluation of
its employment practices, accessibility to programs, services and buildings,
and has developed complaint resolution procedures. The Village seeks to assure
that no employee entitled to participate in any program is inadvertently
excluded from the benefits, services, programs or activities offered by the
Village. Employee input, particularly that of individuals with disabilities and
all employees solicit representative organizations to assist in identifying
potential barriers to participation and to ensure full and equal enjoyment of
programs and services. Continued input is encouraged and desired from all who
are interested.
   (c)   Adoption of Equal Employment Opportunity Plan. See Ordinance No. 04-
2017, passed March 20, 2017, for full Equal Employment Opportunity Plan.

CHAPTER 171
Mayor’s Court
171.01   Community service work program.
171.02   Mayor’s Court established.
171.03   Appointment of magistrate.
171.04   Computerization Fund.
171.05   Waiver schedule.
171.06   Fees and charges.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor’s Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. “Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto.”
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville Ohio, 93 S.Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor’s
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the “Ohio Traffic Rules” which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor’s Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): “Where, in a mayor’s court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.”
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): “Where a transfer is required, the mayor’s court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor’s court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date.”
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

required as a condition of probation under this section unless the offender
agrees to perform the supervised community service work offered as a condition
of probation by the court. The court may require an offender who agrees to
perform work under those circumstances to deposit with the court a reasonable
fee to procure a policy or policies of liability insurance to cover the period
of time during which the offender will perform the community service work.
Workers are covered under the Village’s Workers’ Compensation.
   (b)   The supervised community service work that may be imposed as a
condition of probation shall be subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   The court shall fix the period of community service work that is
imposed as a condition of probation and distribute the period over weekends or
over other appropriate times that will allow the offender to continue at his
occupation or to care for his family. The period of community service work
fixed by the court and Imposed as a condition of probation shall not exceed an
aggregate of eighty hours.
      (2)   The Village must agree to accept the offender for community service
work before the court requires him to perform work for it.
      (3)   The court shall only order the offender to perform community
service work for the Village or an agency of the Village.
      (4)   Community service work that a court requires under this section
shall be supervised by an official of the Village or its designated agency or
by a person designated by the Village or its designated agency. The official or

181.03 INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to taxation by the
provisions of this chapter, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the
Municipality shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the Municipality, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of income
taxation. In the absence of such records, net profit from a business or
profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the Municipality
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes
of income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
(1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the Municipality
during the taxable period to the average net book value of all of the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used herein, real
property includes property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of
such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by
eight.
(2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period to
persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
Municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed In the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
(3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and services
performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing allocation formula
does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform
regulations be substituted so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in subsection (a) hereof, “sales made in the Municipality”
means:
(1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Municipality.
(2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Municipality if the taxpayer Is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Municipality
and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
(3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality regardless of
where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made. (Ord. 169. Passed 12-5-72.)
   (c)   For the purpose of determining income subject to tax pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof, rentals from real property constitute income subject to
tax under the following circumstances:
(1)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and to the
estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or
operated by the taxpayer individually or through agents or other
representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in
part.
(2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax;
provided that in case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating
percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or
not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month; provided
further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when the rental
is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm,
whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per
month; and provided further that the person who operates a rooming house of
five or more rooms rented shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
(3)   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real property,
periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause) rentals are not
received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
(4)   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying and
selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
(5)   Real property, as the term is used in this regulation, shall include
commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and all other
types of real estate.
(6)   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible expenses
shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the Internal
Revenue Service for Federal income tax purposes.
(7)   Residents of this Municipality are subject to taxation upon the net
income from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the location
of the real property owned.
(8)   Nonresidents of this Municipality are subject to such taxation only if
the real property is situated within this Municipality. Nonresidents, in
determining whether gross monthly rentals exceed two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00), shall take into consideration only real estate situated within this
Municipality.
(9)   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only on that
portion of income derived from property located in this Municipality.
         (Ord. 19-93. Passed 12-6-93.)
181.04 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation earned on and after July 1, 1977, and with
respect to the net profit of businesses, professions and other activities
earned on and after July 1, 1977. Provided, however, that where the fiscal year
of the business, profession or other activity differs from a calendar year, the
tax shall be applied to that part of the net profit for the fiscal year as
shall be earned on and after July 1, 1977, to the close of the taxpayer’s
fiscal year; thereafter the taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis.
(Ord. 13-77. Passed 6-13-77.)

effective date of this chapter and on or before April 15, of each year
thereafter, however, if it be made to appear that the taxpayer has paid a
municipal income tax on such net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation to another municipality, the taxpayer shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by him or her or
on his or her behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed
the tax assessed by this chapter on such net profits, salaries, wages,
commissions or compensation earned in such other municipality or municipalities

account of all of the nonresident employer's employees or all of the other
payer's payees exceeds one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for a calendar year
beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the municipal corporation may require
the employer, agent, or other payer to deduct and withhold taxes in each
ensuing year even if the amount required to be deducted and withheld in each of

         C.   1.   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village with respect
to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            2.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the Village
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.   "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Village income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   If, in addition to the Village, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (e)   (1)   A.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Village
for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Village on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (e)(1)A. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the Village for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
         B.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         C.   The address on the individual's driver's license;
         D.   The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
         E.   The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
         F.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         G.   The primary location at which the individual is employed.
         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Village if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Village and while away overnight from
that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Village.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (f)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
the Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section 181A.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
the Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section 181A.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section 181A.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by Tax Administrator
or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and taxpayer before
January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (f)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (f)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village
from a stock of goods located within the Village.
            2.   The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)   The net profit received, by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section 181A.03 or division
(b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at the rate,
specified in Section 181A.03 of two percent. An employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the
date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
         Payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made the Tax
Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each month for
which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
         If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee
spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for
or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (c)
(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for

this section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on twenty
or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty days
in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to
last more than twenty days" if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the Village and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section 181A.04.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time perforating services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the twenty-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section 181A.02, the employer shall
withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a
taxable year and remit that tax only to the Village, regardless of the number
of days which the employee worked outside the corporate boundaries of the
Village.
      To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section 181A.04.

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

the Village.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for the Village income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written

to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of R.C. § 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required
if the net amount is due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the Village income tax return.
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08 , a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the Village an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village income tax chapter for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the Village
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 181A.04(c)(1)G.) within
the Village.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the Village and does
not expect to be subject to the Village income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the Village of Newcomerstown, make any sales in the Village of
Newcomerstown, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by Village of
Newcomerstown during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to
the tax levied by Village of Newcomerstown for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with
Village of Newcomerstown income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The
person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section 181A.04 shall be allowed to
the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by
the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the Village and
the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection
with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns. Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (p)(2)A. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (r)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181A.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
181A.02(c)(2)C.1. to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181A.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.05(r) through (y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section 181A.05(r) through (y),
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the Village;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section 181A.05(r) through (y) by
substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

181A.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
   (b)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. § 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)

   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by

         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section 181A.18 upon
the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the
underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of this
section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
Village under Section 181A.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (c)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 181A.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section 181A.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section 181A.12 has not expired for a previously filed
return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section 181A.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 181A.21.
That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding
by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section 181A.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section 181A.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section 181A.09
(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the assessment's
postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
      Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
      If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)(1)A. of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. 01-2018. Passed 2-10-18.)
181A.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or state law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

   (b)   (1)   This section applies to the following:

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal

Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or

upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom

nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty
pursuant to Section 181A.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section 181A.99 for a
violation of Section 181A.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the
Tax Administrator by law.

   (c)   No vendor shall advertise or state, in any manner, whether directly or

amount of taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or
erroneous assessment where the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the
transient guest. A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount
of taxes paid illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the
transient guest directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid or
credit granted unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written

      (9)   When any vehicle has been operated by any person who is driving
without a lawful license or while his license has been suspended or revoked and
is located upon a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking.
      (10)   When any vehicle is found for which two or more citation tags for
violations of this Traffic Code have been issued and the owner or operator
thereof has failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required, and

purposes of vehicular travel or parking.
   (b) Any vehicle removed under authority of division (a)(2) of this section
shall be ordered into storage and/or disposed of as provided under R.C. §§
4513.60 et seq. Any other vehicle removed under authority of this section shall
be ordered into storage and the Municipal police shall forthwith notify the
registered vehicle owner of the fact of such removal and impounding, reasons
therefor and the place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded
vehicle shall appear at the police offices to furnish satisfactory evidence of
identity and ownership or right to possession. Prior to issuance of a release
form, the claimant, owner or operator shall either pay the amount due for any
fines for violations on account of which such vehicle was impounded or, as the
court may require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to
answer to such violations. The pound operator shall release such vehicle upon
the receipt of the release form and payment of all towage and storage charges.
   (c) No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place of
storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of storage, by the
owner or operator, shall constitute prima-facie evidence that it was so removed
by the owner or operator.
   (d) Towing and storage charges shall be in addition to any penalty for
illegal parking. (Ord. 11-76. Passed 3-15-76.)
   (e) Whenever any vehicle which has been impounded by the police remains in
the possession of the Municipality unclaimed by any person having the right to
the possession of such vehicle, for a period of sixty days, such vehicle shall
be sold under the direction of the Chief of Police at public auction to the
highest bidder, after
notice of such auction has been given for not less than one week by one
publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the Municipality.
303.081 IMPOUNDING V EHICLES ON PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL OR AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY;
PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, “private residential property” means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (h) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall
retain the photographs and the record of the time and date, in electronic or
printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:
            1.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
            4.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may
be recovered;
            5.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be

         B.   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private
property in the chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of either of the following to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to
owner and lienholder information.
         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if the
vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known address
by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first

section.
         D.   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (h)(6)C. of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §

         F.   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or
storage facility is not eligible to obtain title under R.C. § 4505.101, the
towing service or storage facility need only comply with the initial notice
required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this section.
      (7)   A.   The owner or lienholder of a vehicle that is removed under
division (h)(2) of this section may reclaim it upon both of the following:
            1.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement;
            2.   Payment of the following fees:

Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, except that the lienholder of
a vehicle may retrieve the vehicle without paying any storage fee for the
period of time that the vehicle was in the possession of the towing service or
storage facility prior to the date the lienholder received the notice sent
under division (h)(6)A.1. of this section;
               b.   If notice has been sent to the owner and lienholder as

electronic, or otherwise.
         C.   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves
the vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the
vehicle shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the
motor vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action
under R.C. § 4513.611.
         D.   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced
by a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of division (h)(2) of this section may retrieve any personal
items from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. The owner of the vehicle shall not retrieve any personal items from a
vehicle if it would endanger the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees
to sign a waiver of liability. For purposes of division (h)(7)D. of this
section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
      (8)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any vehicle from
private property that is established as a private tow-away zone under this
division (h) or store such a vehicle other than in accordance with this
division (h), or otherwise fail to comply with any applicable requirement of
this division (h).
      (9)   This section does not affect or limit the operation of divisions
(a) through (g) of this section, R.C. § 4513.60 or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to 4613.65
as they relate to property other than private property that is established as a

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle,
as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72 hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (a), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. § 4513.60, 4513.61 and
4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the Municipality
from such disposal.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   (1)   For purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means any
motor vehicle which is three years old or older; extensively damaged, such
damage including but not limited to any of the following: missing wheels,
tires, motor, or transmission; apparently inoperable; and having a fair market
value of $1,500 or less, that is left uncovered in the open on private property
for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or
scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of R.C. § 4737.05
through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of a political
subdivision; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not
subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the
person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that
the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor
vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
      (2)   The Municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector's vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
Municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the
period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Traffic Code is substantially equivalent.
(R.C. § 4510.05)
303.99 GENERAL TRAFFIC CODE PENALTIES.

the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this division, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have “stop” or “yield” signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point of such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this division (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through street or
highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection and
shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(R.C. § 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of- way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of- way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
      (R.C. § 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNALS OVER INDIVIDUAL LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
       (R.C. § 4511.131)
313.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian signals exhibiting the words “walk” or “”don’t
walk,”
or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place, such
signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.
      (R.C. § 4511.14)

313.09 DRIVER’S DUTIES UPON APPROACHING AMBIGUOUS OR NON-WORKING TRAFFIC
SIGNAL.
   (a)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and being advised by the
officer in accordance with R.C. § 4511.192 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance of the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission
to the test or tests, refuse to submit to the test or tests.
   (b)   Operation After Underage Consumption. No person under 21 years of age
shall operate any vehicle within this municipality, if, at the time of the
operation, any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02% but less than
0.08% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person’s whole blood.
      (2)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.03% but less than
0.096% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person’s blood serum or

(d)   (1)   Evidence: Tests: Immunity.
         A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. § 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three- hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under Section 333.011, shall state that the
person may have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, NATIONAL
HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration  established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Laboratory Report as Evidence. Subject to division (e)(3) of
this section, in any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)
(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to
any of those divisions, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel
issued a permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as
described in this division that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that
contains all of the information specified in this division shall be admitted as
prima facie evidence of the information and statements that the report
contains. The laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.

when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the

sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous

sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (k)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s

metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of R.C. § 2923.16(D) in the
same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (m)   Meaning of Terms. All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this
section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with the
meaning of the same term as defined in R.C. § 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as
defined in R.C. § 4510.01 applies to this section.

in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect what were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (n)(3)A. of this section.

333.011 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      (1)   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
      (2)   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 5119.01.
      (3)   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
   (b)   Implied Consent to Chemical Tests. Any person who operates a vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (l) of Section 333.01, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance.
   (c)   Tests at Request of Law Enforcement Agent. The chemical test or tests
under division (b) of this section shall be administered at the request of a
law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person was
operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a division,
section, or ordinance identified in division (b) of this section. The law
enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which of
the tests shall be administered.
   (d)   Effect of Death or Unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (b) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
   (e)   Chemical tests.
      (1)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (c) and (d) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
      (2)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (e)(1) of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
         (ORC 4511.191(A))
   (f)   Advice Required. Except as provided in division (e) of this section,
the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this
division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a), (b) or (l)
of Section 333.01, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
   (g)   Certification of Arrest. Except as provided in division (e) of this
section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (f) of this
section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test or
tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite
of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
   (h)   Actions Required by Arresting Officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(e) of this section or division (f) of this section to submit to a chemical
test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer
shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in which the
arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in
possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the person's
vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
   (i)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (e) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement officer asks a person under
arrest as described in division (e) of this section to submit to a chemical
test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, if the officer advises
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of the person's
refusal or submission, and if either the person refuses to submit to the test
or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of division (l) of Section
333.01, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance
the person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a
prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         A.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         B.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         C.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         D.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (i)(1)D.5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (g) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (i)(1)D.5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (e) of
this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that division,
that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with that
division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a
chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the test or
tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is present
in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (j)   Sworn Report of Arresting Officer. 
      (1)   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
      (2)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
   (k)   Suspension Effective Immediately. A suspension of a person's driver's
or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege
under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is
effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer serves the
notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the
person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the person's being
requested to take the chemical test or tests under this section does not affect
the suspension.
   (l)   Initial Appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in
violation of Section 333.01, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal
OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of
R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless
of whether the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B)
or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified
in that section.
(R.C. § 4511.191(D))
333.012 IMMOBILIZING OR DISABLING DEVICE VIOLATION.
   (a)   (1)   No offender who has been granted limited or unlimited driving
privileges, during any period that the offender is required to operate only a
motor vehicle equipped with an immobilizing or disabling device, shall request
or permit any other person to breathe into the device if it is an ignition
interlock device or another type of device that monitors the concentration of
alcohol in a person’s breath or to otherwise start the motor vehicle equipped
with the device, for the purpose of providing the offender with an operable
motor vehicle.
      (2)   No person shall breathe into an immobilizing or disabling device
that is an ignition interlock device or another type of device that monitors
the concentration of alcohol in a person’s breath or otherwise start a motor
vehicle equipped with an immobilizing or disabling device, for the purpose of
providing an operable motor vehicle to another person who has been granted
limited or unlimited driving privileges under the condition that the person
operate only a motor vehicle equipped with an immobilizing or disabling device.
      (3)   No unauthorized person shall tamper with or circumvent the
operation of an immobilizing or disabling device.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an immobilizing or
disabling device violation, a misdemeanor of the first degree.
(R.C. § 4510.44)

   (a)   No person shall operate a vehicle on any street or highway in willful
or wanton disregard of the safety of persons or property.
   (b)   (1)   No person shall operate a vehicle on any public or private
property other than streets or highways in willful or wanton disregard of the

property knowingly permits such operation thereon.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates any
provision of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year
of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates any
provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If,
within one year of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of
two or more predicate motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates any
provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
(R.C. § 4511.20, 4511.201)
333.03 MAXIMUM SPEED LIMITS; ASSURED CLEAR DISTANCE AHEAD.
   (a)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle at a speed greater or less
than is reasonable or proper, having due regard for the traffic, surface and

than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local

while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected, except
that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (b)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (b)(10) and (b)(11) of this section. The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section
or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-Control
Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.   Any school chartered under R.C. § 3301.16;
            2.   Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C.
3301-35-08, a copy of the school’s report for the parents of the school’s

nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to
the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone;
            3.   Any special elementary school that in writing requests the
County Engineer to create a school zone at the location of the school. Upon
receipt of the written request, the County Engineer shall create a school zone
at that location by erecting appropriate signs;

Upon receipt of such a written request, the County Engineer shall create a
school zone at that location by erecting the appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, “school zone” means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or

local authorities for streets and highways under their jurisdiction
      and that portion of a state highway under the jurisdiction of the
Director of Transportation or a request from a County Engineer in the case of a
school zone for a special elementary school, the Director may extend the
traditional school zone boundaries. The distances in divisions (b)(1)C.1.
through (b)(1)C.3. below shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction,
and are bounded by whichever of the following distances or combination thereof
the Director approves as most appropriate:

pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director’s initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in divisions (b)
(1)A. and (b)(1)C. of this section.
         E.   As used in this division, “crosswalk” has the meaning given that
term in R.C. § 4511.01(LL)(2).
         F.   The Director may, upon request by resolution of the legislative
authority and upon submission by the municipality of such engineering, traffic
and other information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school
zone on any portion of a state route lying within the municipality that
includes a crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school
during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the state route.

maximum prima facie speed limitations as established herein have been altered,
either higher or lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been
erected as required, operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (j)(1)B., (j)(1)C., and
(j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section, a minor misdemeanor;
         B.   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has

operate a motor vehicle, except when necessary for safe operation or in
compliance with the law. No minimum speed limit established hereunder shall be
less than 30 miles per hour, greater than 50 miles per hour, nor effective

section.
      (2)   The Department of Transportation upon request from any local
authority shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of
any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if
it finds that such structure cannot with safety withstand traffic traveling at
the speed otherwise permissible under this Traffic Code, the Department shall
determine and declare the maximum speed of traffic which such structure can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed
to be erected and maintained at a distance of a least 100 feet before each end
of the structure.
      (3)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this
section, proof of such determination of the maximum speed by the Department and

timing is made of the participating vehicles involving competitive
accelerations or speeds. Persons rendering assistance in any manner to such
competitive use of vehicles shall be equally charged as the participants. The
operation of two or more vehicles side by side either at speeds in excess of
prima facie lawful speeds established by R.C. §§ 4511.21(B)(1)(a) through (B)

      (2)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any
public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court may impose upon the
offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. §
4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.
or division (b)(3)B. of this section.

notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours. The
failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the
court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A)
that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other penalties
provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s

(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)
335.072 OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04 and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.28

2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant to R.C. § 2929.27(C) to
serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be
filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been convicted of
or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (c)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).

enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National

driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).

as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time

section that the order of suspension resulted from the failure of the alleged
offender to respond to a financial responsibility random verification request
under R.C. § 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of the initial financial

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as

section. The person charged with a violation of division (a) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.

   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section 408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (a)   (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,

permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.

section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
         (R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor.

or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other
restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the posting of bond
or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge $5, and for each hour of
time or any part thereof spent by each police officer in supervising the
movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of $10.

any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality and the
other jurisdiction or, while in this Municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this Municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
Municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;;
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
state in violation of the law of the state.
   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section is either the act that causes death, or the physical contact that
causes death, or the death itself. If any part of the body of a homicide victim
is found in this Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within
this Municipality.
   (c)   (1)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which

has jurisdiction on the Ohio river under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (e)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.

      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (d) to (l) of this
section, a prosecution of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 or a
conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in committing a
violation of either section shall be barred unless it is commenced within 25
years after the offense is committed.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (a)(5)B. and (e) to

            1.   A patient who was the victim of the violation;
            2.   The spouse or surviving spouse of a patient who was the victim

            3.   Any child born as a result of the violation.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
R.C. § 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or concealed the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
         (R.C. § 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in R.C. § 718.06(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   His or her liability is based on conduct which includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty which he or she is
capable of performing;
      (2)   He or she has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
         (R.C. § 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under
the Ohio Revised Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense
attempted is a misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of
any provision of R.C. Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
state law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
         (R.C. § 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
(4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
501.13 PAYMENT OF COST OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and who as a consequence thereof, is confined in any jail or
workhouse, shall reimburse the Village for its expenses incurred by reason of
his or her confinement, including but not limited to the expenses relating to
the provisions of food, clothing, medical care and shelter.
   (b)   The Solicitor is hereby authorized to institute any appropriate civil
suit in the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas for recovery of the
expenses referred to in division (a) of this section, the amount of the
reimbursement to be determined by the Court pursuant to R.C. § 2929.223
(Ord. 10-85. Passed 7-1-85.)
 501.14 DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED OR FORFEITED PROPERTY.
   (a)   Safekeeping of Property in Custody.
      (1)   A.   Any property that has been lost, abandoned, stolen, seized
pursuant to a search warrant, or otherwise lawfully seized or forfeited and
that is in the custody of the Police Department shall be kept safely by the
Police Department, pending the time it no longer is needed as evidence or for
another lawful purpose, and shall be disposed of pursuant to this section or
R.C. § 2981.12 and 2981.13.
         B.   This section does not apply to the custody and disposal of any of
the following:
            1.   Vehicles subject to forfeiture under R.C. Title 45, except as
provided in division (b)(1)F. of this section;
            2.   Abandoned junk motor vehicles or other property of negligible
value;
            3.   Property held by a department of rehabilitation and correction
institution that is unclaimed, that does not have an identified owner, that the

the property, which shall include, but not be limited to, both of the
following:
               a.   The manner in which it was disposed, the date of
disposition, detailed financial records concerning any property sold, and the
name of any person who received
            the property. The record shall not identify or enable
identification of the individual officer who seized any item of property.
               b.   An itemized list of the specific expenditures made with
amounts that are gained from the sale of the property and that are retained by

      (3)   The Police Department, with custody of property to be disposed of

to locate persons entitled to possession of the property, to notify them of
when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general

may be given to the law enforcement agency that initially seized the mobile
instrumentality for use in performing its duties, if the agency wants the
mobile instrumentality. The agency shall take the mobile instrumentality
subject to any security interest or lien on the mobile instrumentality.
            2.   Vehicles and vehicle parts forfeited under R.C. §§ 4549.61 to

that purpose or disposed of under division (b)(2) of this section.
         H.   Money seized in connection with a violation of R.C. § 2905.32,
2907.21, or 2907.22 shall be deposited in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund
created by R.C. § 5101.87.
      (2)   Unclaimed or forfeited property that is not described in division
(b)(1) of this section or division (a)(1)B. of this section, with court
approval, may be used by the law enforcement agency in possession of it. If it
is not used by the agency, it may be sold without appraisal at a public auction
to the highest bidder for cash or disposed of in another manner that the court
considers proper.
      (3)   Except as provided in divisions (b)(1) and (b)(5) of this section
and after compliance with division (b)(4) of this section when applicable, any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of pursuant to this section
shall be placed in the general revenue fund of the State, or the general fund
of the Municipality.
      (4)   If the property was in the possession of the Police Department in
relation to a delinquent child proceeding in a juvenile court, 10% of any
moneys acquired from the sale of property disposed of under this section shall
be applied to one or more community addiction services providers, as defined in
R.C. § 5119.01. A juvenile court shall not specify a services provider, except
as provided in this division, unless the services provider is in the same
county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (b)(3) of this section.
      (5)   A.   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department
of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring that
recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a citizens’
reward program and the County includes a part, but not all, of the territory of
the Municipality, the Board shall so notify the Police Department of the
recognition of the citizens' reward program only if the County contains the
highest percentage of the Municipality’s population.
         B.   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of
pursuant to this section to the citizens’ reward program for use exclusively to
pay rewards. No part of the funds may be used to pay expenses associated with
the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
County or in another state in addition to this State receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the County from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or
other property seized because the personal effects, tools, or other property
were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (b)
shall be placed in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund created by R.C. §
5101.87.
         (R.C. § 2981.12)
   (c)   Disposition of Contraband, Proceeds, or Instrumentalities. Except as
otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (b) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (b) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.
(R.C. § 2981.13(A))

501.15 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in Section 501.99.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
533.99 or
501.99 of this Code or R.C. § 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
501.99(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
501.99(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under § 501.99(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of
the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for
prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is
necessary to deter the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. § 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
501.16 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
501.99, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$1,000.
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(R.C. § 2929.31)
501.17 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.07, 2903.08 or
4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a State correctional
institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
         (R.C. § 2929.41)
501.18 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 4510.07 or in any other provision of
the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.
(R.C. § 4510.05)
501.19 SELF-DEFENSE; LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
533.99 or
501.15 of this Code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241
or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and any
residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (R.C. § 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a
jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the
following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a Department of
Probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the Department of Probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the Department of Probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e) or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
         (R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
         (R.C. § 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.

keeper, or harborer of a dangerous dog shall fail to do the following:
      (1)   Obtain liability insurance with an insurer authorized to write

         C.   The dog attacks another animal while the dog is off the property
of the owner of the dog.
      (4)   If the dog is sold, given to another person, or dies, notify the
County Auditor within ten days of the sale, transfer, or death.

      (1)   Debark or surgically silence a dog that the person knows or has

of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
      (3)   A.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within the
same county, the owner shall provide notice of the new address to the County
Auditor within ten days of relocating to the new address.

         (R.C. § 955.22)
   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.16 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience training, or to do both.
            (R.C. § 955.99(E))
      (3)   A.   Whoever commits a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the first

a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of
this section, if a violation of division (d) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to

court may order the offender to personally supervise the dangerous dog that the
offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both, and the court may order the offender to obtain
liability insurance pursuant to division (f) of this section. The court, in the
alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound at the
owner’s expense.
         (R.C. § 955.99(G))
      (5)   A.   Whoever commits a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a vicious dog is guilty of one of the following:
            1.   A felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the

            2.   A misdemeanor of the first degree if the dog causes serious
injury to a person. Additionally, the court may order the vicious dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the
county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (l)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that R.C. § 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that § 618.16 applies with respect to the dog as
if it were a dangerous dog. As part of the order, the court shall order the
offender to obtain the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) of
this section in an amount, exclusive of interest and costs, that equals or
exceeds $100,000. Until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal of a violation of division (d) of this section and at
the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with the provisions described in division (e) of this section or at
the county dog pound at the owner’s expense.

of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be
confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions of division (e) of
this section or at the county dog pound at the owner’s expense.

is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
         (R.C. § 955.99(M))

division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was
seized. The notice shall include a statement that a security in the amount of
$100 is due to the county dog warden within ten days to secure payment of all
reasonable expenses, including medical care and boarding of the dog for 60
days, expected to be incurred by the county dog pound in caring for the dog
pending the determination. The county dog warden may draw from the security any
actual costs incurred in caring for the dog.

of this section does not do so within ten days of the confinement of the
animal, the dog is forfeited, and the county dog warden may determine the
disposition of the dog unless the court issues an order that specifies
otherwise.

determination under division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the
county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security
provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the

States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such
exercise by first delivering to the Police Department written communication

with their home address and telephone number, addressed to the Police Chief

at night during the hours when this section is otherwise applicable to the
minor, in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such
communication.

immediate reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on
duty at the Police Station.
      (7)   When authorized by special permit from the Mayor, carried on the
person of the minor, when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be
inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter. A written
application shall be given to the Mayor, signed by a minor and by a parent of
such minor, if feasible, stating:
         A.   The name, age and address of such minor;
         B.   The name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof;
         C.   The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other
physical characteristics of such minor;

public places at such hours as in the Mayor’s opinion may reasonably be
necessary. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone, or other
effective communication, with a corresponding record being made
contemporaneously, either to the Mayor, or if unavailable, to the Police Chief.
      (8)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the Mayor, in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to
necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on
an individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Mayor
permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to
permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such
as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of public
places permitted, and the period of time involved not to extend more than
thirty minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity.

      (1)   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or
by inefficient control allow such minor to be in or upon any public place under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this chapter. “Knowingly” includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent’s legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
      (2)   It shall be an affirmative defense to this section that such parent
has within thirty days preceding the alleged violation filed or caused to be

organization leases from a person other than a charitable organization the
premises on which it conducts bingo sessions, the lessor of the premises shall
provide only the premises to the organization and shall not provide the
organization with bingo game operators, security personnel, concessions or
concession operators, bingo supplies, or any other type of service. A

bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the time
specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,
the organization may conduct bingo sessions at the premises, on the day of the
week, and at the time specified on its amended license;

electronic bingo aid.
            4.   An electronic bingo aid cannot be part of an electronic
network other than a network that includes only bingo aids and devices that are

with any device not located on the premises at which the bingo is being
conducted.
            5.   An electronic bingo aid cannot be used to participate in bingo
that is conducted at a location other than the location at which the bingo

      (3)   Nothing in this division (d) of this section prohibits an employee
of a fraternal organization, veteran's organization, or sporting organization

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Section 545.02(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716,14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant to
a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
   (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)
(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing which has intrinsic
worth to its owner and which is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under divisions (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of such property or services. As used in this section,
“fair market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which such property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of such security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
such livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima-facie evidence of the value of such instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of such
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for such services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in such notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of such
services.
         (R.C. § 2913.61(B) - (E))

   (a)   In the development and adoption of this chapter, it is recognized that
there are some adult businesses which due to their very nature, have serious
objectionable operational characteristics. The characteristics of these uses
are further heightened by their concentration in any one area having a negative
effect upon adjacent areas. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the
location and concentration of adult entertainment establishments, as herein
defined, in order to achieve the following:
      (1)   To preserve the character and quality of life in the Village’s
neighborhoods and business areas.
      (2)   To control such documented harmful and adverse secondary effects of
adult uses on the surrounding areas as decreased property values, loss of
business for surrounding nonadult businesses, and deterioration of
neighborhoods.
      (3)   To restrict minors’ access to adult uses.
      (4)   To maintain the general welfare and safety for the Village’s
residents.
   (b)   It is not the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market; neither is it the intent nor
the effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
materials.

Village.
      (2)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries have
increased the demand and need for access to rights-of-way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.

structures and facilities in, the rights-of-way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the rights-of-way, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The Village has authority under the Laws and Constitution of the
State of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4 and 7, to
regulate public and private entities which use the rights-of-way.

their uses are not singled out in this chapter. The Village recognizes the
inherent differences between aerial and underground utilities and that some
rules and regulations may pertain to one and not the other. Where there is a
question of applicability, the chapter shall be applied in the least
restrictive way for the occupant, providing the municipalities primary goal of
maintaining and managing the right-of-way is not negatively impacted.

responsible for the administration of this chapter, except as otherwise
provided herein. The Mayor may delegate any or all of the duties hereunder to
the Director of Public Works or other designee.
   (b)   Rights-of-way Occupancy. Each person who occupies, uses or seeks to
occupy or use the rights-of-way to operate a system located in the rights-of-
way, or who has, or seeks to have, a system located in any rights-of-way, shall
apply for and obtain a certificate of registration pursuant to this chapter.
Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system in the rights-of-way
without a certificate of registration, including persons operating under a
permit, license or franchise issued by the Village prior to the effective date
of this chapter shall apply for and obtain a certificate of registration from
the Village, unless exempted by division (d) of this section. Application will
consist of providing the information set forth in Section 911.04 and as
reasonably required by the Mayor.
   (c)   No Construction Without a Certificate of Registration. Following the
effective date of this chapter, no person shall construct or perform any work
on or in, or use any system or any part thereof located on or in any rights-of-
way without first obtaining a certificate of registration. Whoever violates
this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree as provided for in
Section 911.99.
   (d)   Exceptions.

the purpose of providing only cable service and operating pursuant to a valid
cable franchise, and video service provider for the purpose of providing only

exempt from any requirement of the certificate of registration process that is
in direct conflict with the requirements of, and/or specifically exempted by, a
valid current and valid cable franchise with the Village.
   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Any system or
part of a system found in a rights- of-way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The Village may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the
nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or non-complying portion of
such system; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities
in the rights-of-way, the Village shall not be liable for any damages caused
thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that shall be
placed in the rights-of-way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the Village. No
provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this chapter as creating a
special duty to any provider.
   (g)   Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any system in the Village shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the Village that the
provider's obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this section
and any other sections in the Code have been lawfully assumed by another
applicant and/or provider;
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the Village's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Village Engineer;
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Village Engineer must approve said proposal;
         D.   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
system in a manner acceptable to the Village within a reasonable amount of time
if the Village believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
         E.   Submit to the Village within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with R.C. § 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its facilities to the Village. If a provider proceeds under this
clause, the Village may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to Section 911.18(b), require the provider to post a bond in an amount
sufficient to reimburse the Village for reasonably anticipated costs to be
incurred in removing the facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The Village may exercise any remedies
or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         A.   Abating the nuisance;
         B.   Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of R.C. § 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         C.   Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the
provider's surety.
      (3)   If the Village requires a provider to remove unused facilities in
any rights-of-way, the Village shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this
removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the rights-of-
way. If the Village abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to
recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to,
those methods set forth in R.C. § 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the rights-of- way. A certificate of registration
is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the Village,
for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate
of registration and in accordance with this chapter. The rights to occupy the
right-of-way may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or
more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way
so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this chapter.
Collocating providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its
facilities on facilities of others, including the Village's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of the Code or other applicable law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a certificate
of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate Federal, state and local authorities and
upon the Village's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents
to the Village. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to this
chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere
with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires,
fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever
under the management or control of the Village.

Registration. In addition to the other requirements set forth herein and in the
rules and regulations each provider shall:
      (1)   Use its best efforts to cooperate with other providers and users of

      (3)   Upon reasonable written notice, and at the direction of the Mayor
or his/her designee, promptly remove or rearrange facilities as necessary for
public safety;
      (4)   Perform all work, construction, maintenance or removal of
facilities within the rights-of-way, in accordance with good engineering,
construction and arboricultural practice (if applicable), including any
appropriate state building codes, safety codes and law and use best efforts to
repair and replace any street, curb or other portion of the rights-of-way, or
facilities located therein, to a condition to be determined by the Village
Engineer to be adequate under current standards and not less than materially

minimizes any inconvenience to the public, the Village and other providers, all
in accordance with all applicable provisions of this chapter, any rules and
regulations the Village may adopt and the Code;
      (5)   Construct, install, operate and maintain its facilities and system

the Mayor or his/her designee and must be performed in accordance with standard
horticultural and arboreal practices as promulgated by entities such as the
National Arbor Day Foundation, the International Society of Arboriculture, and
the Tree Care Industry, all as may be required by the Village. Pruning shall at

within two business days of the start of the work. Any non-emergency tree
removal or the use of vegetation management programs within the rights-of-way
that is performed without the Mayor or designee's written permission shall
subject a person to the penalties of Section 911.99 and may further require
that the tree or vegetation be replaced, at the sole expense of the responsible
person, with a healthy tree or vegetation of like kind and quality;
      (7)   Warrant that all worker facilities, conditions and procedures that

the provider for the cost thereof; and
      (10)   Providers shall use all reasonable efforts to field identify their
facilities in the rights-of-way whenever providers are notified by the Village
that the Village has determined that such identification is reasonably
necessary in order for the Village to begin planning for the construction,
paving, maintenance, repairing, relocating or in any way altering any street or
area in the rights-of-way as defined in this chapter. The Village shall notify
the providers of the Village's date to begin the process at least thirty days
prior to the commencement of said activities. In field identifying facilities:
         A.   Providers shall identify all facilities that are within the
affected rights-of-way using customary industry standards and distinct
identification;
         B.   Facilities will be so marked as to identify the provider
responsible for said facilities;
         C.   Should any such marking interfere with the facilities function,
create a safety problem or violate any safety code, alternative methods of
marking the facilities may be approved by the Village Engineer; and
         D.   All marking should be clearly readable from the ground and
include provider's name, logo and identification numbering or tracking
information. No advertising will be permitted.
      (11)   A provider that is replacing an existing utility pole shall be
responsible to coordinate with all other providers to ensure the orderly
transfer of all lines or cables to the replacement utility pole, the removal of
the existing utility pole, and the restoration of the rights-of-way within
thirty days weather permitting after the replacement utility pole is installed.
Upon request, the Mayor may grant the provider additional time for good cause.
   (f)   Establishment of Utility Corridors.
      (1)   The Village Council may assign specific corridors within the
rights-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each
type of facilities that are, or that the Village Engineer expects, may someday
be, located within the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Any provider whose facilities are in the rights-of-way and are in a
position at variance with utility corridors established by the Village Council
shall at the time of the next construction of the area, excluding normal
maintenance activities, move such facilities to their assigned position within
the rights-of-way. Existing underground facilities located within a designated
utility corridor shall not be required to relocate into adjacent or alternative
portions of the rights-of-way unless they are in conflict with an actual or
proposed public improvement project. The above requirements may be waived by
the Mayor for good cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of
such factors as: the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, law precluding such undergrounding of faculties, and
hardship to the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the
above requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Mayor.
      (3)   The Village Engineer shall make every good faith attempt to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way as set forth
in this chapter.
      (4)   Providers may enter into written agreements to use existing poles
and conduits with the owners of same and shall use best efforts to install
their facilities within the rights-of-way.
      (5)   No facility placed in any rights-of-way shall be placed in such a
manner that interferes with normal travel on such rights-of-way.

or Section
911.04(f)(6)C. all facilities within the rights-of-way shall be constructed and
located in accordance with the Code and with the following provision:
         A.   Whenever all existing facilities that have been traditionally
located overhead are located underground in a certain area within the Village,
a provider who desires to place its facilities in the same area must also
locate its facilities underground.
         B.   Whenever a provider is required to locate or re-locate facilities
underground within a certain area of the Village, every provider with
facilities within the same area of the Village shall concurrently re-locate
their facilities underground.
         C.   The above requirements may be waived by the Village for good
cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of such factors as:
the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service
needs, law precluding such undergrounding of the facilities, and hardship to
the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Village Engineer to the
Mayor.
            (Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.05 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each provider shall, at the
time of initial application and by January 1 of each following year, file a
construction and major maintenance plan with the Director of Public Works. Such
construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided for all geographical
areas requested by the Village Engineer, up to and including the entire
geographical area of the Village. It shall be submitted using a format(s)
mutually agreeable to the provider and the Village and shall contain the
information determined by the Village Engineer to be necessary to facilitate
the coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in the rights-
of-way. The construction and major maintenance plan shall include, but not be
limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects
for the next calendar year, if none are scheduled or anticipated then the plan
shall so state. The provider shall use its best efforts in supplying this
information and shall update the construction and major maintenance plan on
file with the Director of Public Works whenever there is a material change in
scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects. In an effort to assist
providers with the completion of their annual construction and major
maintenance plan, the Village Engineer, as soon as possible, will send each
provider's system representative a descriptive narrative (and any mapping
information reasonably available) for all the planned right-of-way improvements
and/or scheduled maintenance that the Village then currently intends to
undertake during the calendar year.
   (b)   Mapping Data. With the filing of its application for a certificate of
registration, a provider shall be required to accurately inform the Village of
the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the
provider's system then currently occupies. With the filing of its application
for a certificate of registration, a provider may voluntarily provide such
mapping data to demonstrate accurately the general location of its system
within the public right-of-way. The municipality reserves the right to create
its own public way inventory map and may recover the cost of creation through
the registration process.
   (c)   Exemption from Disclosure. A provider shall notify the Village if the
provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document being
submitted to the Village is exempt from the public records disclosure
requirements of R.C. § 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and
indicate the specific document or portion of a document that the provider
believes is exempt from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal
basis for the claimed exemption, including the applicable statutory reference
and any additional information necessary to make a determination of exemption
for each specific document or portion of a document. If a public records
request is made for documents submitted by a provider, the Village will
consider the written notification in making its own independent determination
of whether a specific document or a portion of a document is exempt from the
disclosure requirements of R.C. § 149.43. To the extent permitted by law, the
Village will endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to notify the provider of
the request prior to making the document available for inspection or copying.
(Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.06 COMPENSATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Compensation. As compensation for the Village's costs to administer
this chapter, manage, administer and control the rights-of-way and maintain
each certificate of registration issued, every provider or any person operating
a system shall pay to the Village registration maintenance fees beginning on or
about the effective date of this chapter. The registration maintenance fee
shall be determined and assessed to providers and other persons operating a
system or otherwise using and occupying the rights-of-way in accordance with
the following process and formula:
      (1)   The Village by January 31st of each year shall calculate all actual
and incurred costs associated with rights-of-way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the Village was not able to
reasonably recover through construction permit fees or other recovery
mechanisms provided for in this chapter.
      (2)   Providers and applicants, as required in Section 911.03(b), shall
accurately inform the Village upon application for a certificate of
registration and on or before each subsequent January 1st of the number of
miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right-of-way the provider's system
then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1st.
      (3)   The Village shall total the entire number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers.
      (4)   The Village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
division (a)(1) of this section by the total number of miles of right-of-way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers as referenced in division
(a)(3) of this section to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The Village shall then multiply each provider's mileage calculation
as referenced in division (a)(2) of this section by the per-mile cost
calculation referenced in division (a)(4) of this section. The product shall be
a provider's then current annual registration maintenance fee.
      (6)   The Village shall perform its annual calculation of registration
maintenance fees following receipt of the providers required January 1 mileage
report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to providers on or
about February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due thirty days following
receipt.
      (7)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive cable franchises for
the purposes of providing cable service, video services provider operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing video services, and providers of open
video system services, which compensate the Village under other mechanisms in
an amount equal to or greater than the annual registration maintenance fee that
would normally be required for their right-of-way use in the Village, shall
have the mileage of the right-of-way they use and/or occupy included in the
calculations described in this section, but shall not be required to contribute
to the recovery of rights-of-way costs as defined by this chapter with the
exception of permit costs.
      (8)   The Village may by separate legislation enacted by Village Council
on or about January 31st of each year, in accordance with the results of
division (a)(4) of this section, enact an initial and thereafter a new annual
registration maintenance fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or
decreasing the previous years registration maintenance fee (per mile). Revised
registration maintenance fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (b)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in advance by
January 1st of each calendar year. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid
in full for the first year of the registration as a condition of the
certificate of registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the
effective date of the certificate of registration to the end of the calendar
year if less than one full year.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of Village property as a result of a
provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter and shall not be considered an
offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in this chapter. The
registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by
applicable law.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the Village by January 31, the provider shall
pay a monthly late charge of one percent of the unpaid balance for each month
or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the Village of any
registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
Village may have for additional sums payable.
(Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.07 OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Reports. Upon reasonable request of the Mayor, a provider shall
provide the Village with a list of any and all material communications, public
reports, petitions, or other filings, either received from or submitted to any
municipal, county, state or Federal agency or official (and any response
thereto submitted by or received by a provider), and any other information or
report reasonably related to a provider's obligations under this chapter which
in any way materially effects the operation of the system or a provider's
representations and warranties set forth herein, but not including tax returns
or other filings which are confidential. Upon request, a provider shall
promptly, but in no case later than thirty business days following the request,
deliver to the Village a complete copy of any item on said list. Upon the
request of the Village, a provider shall promptly submit to the Village any
information or report reasonably related to a provider's obligations under this
chapter, its business and operations with respect to the system or its
operation, in such form and containing such information as the Village shall
specify. Such information or report shall be accurate and complete and supplied
within thirty days.
   (b)   Confidentiality. All information submitted to the Village that is
considered confidential/proprietary information must be clearly marked as such
when submitted. A provider, at any time after submitting information without
confidential/proprietary information markings, may request and shall be
provided the opportunity to, subsequently mark any provided information as
confidential/proprietary information. The Village shall exercise all reasonable
legal protections so as not to publicly disclose to any third party such
information unless required by law. The Village shall, following receipt of a
request for public disclosure of clearly marked trade secret and/or proprietary
information submitted by a provider, endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to
timely place the provider's system representative on notice that such a request
for public disclosure has been made.
   (c)   Provider's Expense. All reports and records required under this
chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider.
   (d)   Right of Inspection and Audit. The Village's designated

normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to a provider under the
circumstances; documents, records, or other information which pertain to a
provider's operation of a system within the Village that are related to its
obligations under this chapter. All such documents shall be made available
within the Village or in such other place that the Village may agree upon in
writing in order to facilitate said inspection, examination, or audit.
   (e)   Rules and Regulations. The Village Engineer may propose, and Village
Council may adopt (and from time to time amend) the rules and regulations
regarding this chapter, construction standards and occupancy requirements of
the right-of-way. Such rules and regulations shall not materially increase the
obligation of any provider hereunder, provided however that none of the
following shall in any way be considered a material increase in obligation; the
adoption of rules and regulations increasing fees; the requiring of the
placement of facilities in designated portions of the rights-of-way
(underground or otherwise); the overbuilding of facilities; or the requiring of
joint-builds. Prior to the adoption or amendment of the rules and regulations,
the Village shall provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of
such adoption or amendment, via United States Regular Mail, to each provider
who holds a then current certificate of registration. Each provider shall then
have thirty days following the date of the Village's mailing to provide written
comment regarding the proposed language to the Village. At least forty-five
days, but not more than sixty days following the date of the Village's mailing,
the Village shall schedule and hold a meeting, to make available a forum at
which all then current providers may address any questions, concerns and make
reasonable suggestions regarding the proposed new rules and regulations to the
Village. The Village Engineer shall, following said meeting and the review of
the providers' comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the rules and
regulations in a manner that best serves the Village, for approval by Village
Council.

911.10 CIVIL FORFEITURES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this chapter and the remedy
of specific performance, which may be enforced in a court of competent

assessing said penalty, the Village will provide written notice to the provider
detailing the failure to comply with a specific provision of this chapter. Such
notice shall also indicate that said penalty shall be assessed in fifteen
calendar days subsequent to the date of receipt if compliance is not achieved.
If a provider desires to challenge such penalty, provider must request a public
hearing before the Mayor within ten days of service of the notice. Such public
hearing shall be held within thirty days of the provider's request. If provider
requests such hearing before the Mayor, such penalty shall be temporarily
suspended. However, if, after the public hearing, the Mayor determines that
provider failed to comply with the specific provision(s) of this chapter
referenced in the notice, such penalty shall be assessed starting with the
fifteen calendar days after receipt of the notice referenced in this section
and continuing each day thereafter until compliance is achieved. The
determination of the Mayor shall be final. The provider may file an
administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506. The penalty shall continue

Mayor decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure
shall be followed:
      (1)   Village shall serve a provider with a written notice of the reason
or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a provider a minimum of
fifteen calendar days to cure its breach.
      (2)   If the provider fails to cure within fifteen calendar days, the
Village Engineer may declare the certificate of registration terminated.

installing additional systems or any part of a system, the posting of a
construction bond and removal bond, acceptable to the Village and subject to
this chapter, for the additional systems or any part of a system is required.
         L.   Upon request, the Village Engineer may modify or waive the
information requirements if they are not necessary in evaluating the
construction permit application. The Village Engineer may request applicable
and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in evaluating the
construction permit application.
   (c)   Issuance of Permit; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Village determines that the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this chapter and the construction permit process, the Village
shall issue a construction permit subject to the provisions of division (c)(2)
of this section.
      (2)   The Village may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of
the construction permit and the performance of the permittee thereunder in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the
structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety
of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Construction Permit Fees.
      (1)   The Village shall annually calculate construction permit fees and
appropriately revise any prior year's construction permit fees based upon the
formula and calculations described in division (d) of this section.
Construction permit fees shall remain in effect until the Village's next annual
modification of the construction permit fees.
      (2)   The Village, on or about January 1st of each year, shall calculate
all the actual and incurred construction permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
rights-of-way that will result from construction that takes place therein.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
section means the accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way caused by
construction in or disturbance of the rights-of-way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such rights-of-way earlier than would be required if the
construction did not occur.
      (3)   The Village, on or about January 1st of each year, shall total all
the construction permit fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled
fees required by the prior year’s construction permit fees for the previous
calendar year.
      (4)   The Village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
division (d)(2) of this section by the total construction permit fees received
as referenced in division (d)(3) of this section to arrive at a numerical
factor representing the previous years cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The Village shall multiply the then currently codified construction
permit fees by the numerical factor as referenced in division (d)(4) of this
section to calculate revised permit fees for the new calendar year.
      (6)   The Village shall act, on or about January 31st of each year, in
accordance with the results of division (d)(5) of this section, to codify new
annual permit fees by separate legislation enacted by Council by appropriately
increasing or decreasing the previous years permit fees. Revised permit fees
shall be effective upon passage. Any permit requests pending on the date of any
annual permit fee modification shall be subject to all new permit fees as
modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in division (d)(8) of this section, no
construction permit shall be issued without payment of construction permit fees
except to the Village which shall be exempt. Construction permit fees that were
paid for a permit that the Village has revoked due to breach and in accordance
with the terms of Section
911.11 or
911.17(e) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Mayor may permit a provider to make quarterly payments of
construction permit fees based upon the provider's financial condition and past
payment history. The quarterly payment shall be due and payable within thirty
days after the end of the quarter. The Mayor may revoke this permission due to
a change in financial condition, late payment, or other just cause.
   (e)   Joint Applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
applications for construction permits to work in the rights-of-way at the same
place and time. Joint applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
construction permit fees.
(Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.15 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial construction, extension, or
relocation of facilities in the rights-of-way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the Village) or another permittee, a permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Village Engineer. Where such
construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
permittee located within the rights-of-way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all best efforts to cooperate and assist any other permittee or
person who is directed by the Village to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the rights-of-way along the proposed system
route. Upon request of the Village Engineer, a permittee shall also record and
identify the general location of all other facilities in the rights- of-way
along the proposed system route. For the purposes of this section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the rights-of-way, but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the rights-of-way.
         D.   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in division (a)(1)A. to C. of this section on the construction
permittee's proposed system route maps and construction plans, along with the
locations of the proposed facilities and all other topographic and cadastral
information.
         E.   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with division (a)(1)D., permittee has the option of either utilizing
non-destructive digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical
points identified to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal,
vertical and spatial position, composition, size and other specifications of
the conflicting underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans
to eliminate the apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Village Engineer, a
permittee shall not excavate more than a twelve inch hole in the rights-of-way
to complete this task for each apparent conflict. Any surfaces damaged shall be
immediately repaired by the permittee. A minimum of two working days notice
shall be provided to the Village prior to performing these investigations.
         F.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to Village. Upon completion of the tasks described in division
(a) of this section, the construction permittee shall submit, if necessary
labeled in accordance with the requirements of Section
911.07 (b), the proposed system route maps and construction plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Village. The mapping data is only required to be at the "Atlas" level of detail
necessary for the Village to reasonably determine the location of the
provider's facilities in the rights-of-way. The provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Village Engineer determines that the format
currently being used by the provider is not capable of being read by the
Village.
   (c)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the permittee if in the discretion of the
Village Engineer the construction permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
divisions (a) through (c) of this section.
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter
or in the rules and regulations, or unless the Village Engineer waives any of
the requirements of this section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a
permittee shall be required to submit a written construction schedule to the
Village not less than five working days before commencing any work in or about
the rights-of-way, and shall further notify the Village not less than two
working days in advance of any excavation in the rights-of-way. This section
shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances under Section
911.17 (d)(1) (Emergency Situations) and Section
911.16  (Minor Maintenance).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the Village's rules and regulations. Detailed plans and
applicable specifications shall be submitted to the Village for review and
approval prior to construction of any facilities except those that are
categorized as "minor maintenance" issues as per Section
911.16.
      (2)   The Village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the Village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future
Village and county plans for public improvements, development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among providers.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights-of-way. Specifically, every permittee when
performing underground construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize trenchless
technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or microtunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface rights-of-way pursuant to this chapter may be required to be
installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable
may be installed pursuant to this chapter using "direct bury" techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions. The Village may grant a special exception to the
requirements of division (f) and (g) of this section if a permittee, upon
application, demonstrates with written evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the permittee to provide services in the Village.
      (3)   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the Village herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the Village.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way
whenever the Village finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation.
In instances where the Village requests removal and/or relocation, the Village
shall waive all applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or
relocation, the provider shall restore the rights-of-way to the same or better
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are
required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be
replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In accordance with law, the
Village may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable
interference by the provider's facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Village.
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
         C.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a right-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
rights-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the Village, a provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by the
Village, within thirty days after the Village's removal order, or if a provider
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the rights-of-way of the Village, within twelve months thereafter, then, to
the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the Village shall have the
right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the Village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of- way of the Village at provider's cost and
expense, by another person; however, the Village shall have no liability for
any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the
Village for all reasonable costs incurred by the Village in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the Village
designated by the Village for removal and not timely removed by the provider
shall belong to and become the property of the Village without payment to the
provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
Village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the Village, to
evidence such ownership by the Village.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any rights-of-way excavation, each
provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its facilities.
      (2)   All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights-of-way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
rules and regulations. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of rights-of-way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
engineer, and complete the restoration of the rights-of-way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
Village.
      (2)   In approving an application for a construction permit, the Village
may choose either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or
alternatively to restore the rights-of-way itself if the permittee has in the
past not abided by requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   If the Village allows a permittee to restore the rights-of-way, the
permittee may at the time of application for a construction permit be required
to post a construction bond in an amount submitted by the permittee with a
detailed cost breakdown to the Village Engineer for approval that is sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve months after completion of the restoration of
the rights-of-way, the Village determines that the rights-of-way have been
properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the Village. The Village shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
Village in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights-of-way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the rights-of-way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve months following its completion. During
this twelve month period, it shall, upon notification from the Mayor, correct
all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the
Village Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five
calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Mayor, unless otherwise
extended by the Mayor.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Village, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the Village, the Village, at its
option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the
Village, within thirty days of billing, the restoration cost of restoring the
rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the Village. Upon failure to pay,
the Village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/
or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the Village and/or another
permitee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the restoration
responsibility among the Village, providers and/or other persons.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the Village
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary, as may be allowed by
law, to maintain, support, or move a provider's facilities to protect those
facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that provider and
shall be paid within thirty days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay,
the Village may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider
does not pay or the Village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted
by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the Village's response to an
emergency occasioned by that provider's facilities.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Village-owned facilities in the rights-of-way which the provider or its
facilities damage.
   (m)   Rights-of-way Vacation. If the Village sells or otherwise transfers a
rights-of-way which contains the facilities of a provider, such sale or
transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements
required pursuant to R.C. § 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Village Engineer.
   (o)   Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall notify the Village.
      (1)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the permit and/or this chapter.
      (3)   The inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as
provided in Section
911.20(b). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Works. The
decision of the Director of Public Works may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the
order, the provider shall present proof to the Director of Public Works that
the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the Mayor may revoke the permit pursuant to Section
911.17(e).
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in Section
911.17(d)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a rights-of-way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Village Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the
service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by this
chapter, a provider shall locate facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of facilities underground
is consistent with the provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the Village, always use best efforts to place
facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and facilities
installed), all facilities to be installed by a provider under the right-of-way
shall be installed in conduit.

   (a)   Right-of-way Minor Maintenance Permit Requirement. No person shall
perform minor maintenance of facilities in the rights-of-way without first
having obtained a right-of-way minor maintenance permit as set forth in this
chapter. Minor maintenance means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction and not requiring
traffic control for more than two hours at any one location; (ii) or the
routine repair or replacement of facilities with like facilities not involving
construction and taking place on thoroughfares and arteries between the hours
of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.; (iii) or the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction on all rights-of-
ways, other than thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and

than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than eight contiguous hours
to complete, does not impede traffic and does not involve a pavement cut; or
(v) minor and/or non-material vegetation management/tree pruning. The Village
Engineer may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to Section 911.07(e) that
clarify the definition of minor maintenance and/or provide a process for a
provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes minor
maintenance.
      (1)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit allows the right-of-way
minor maintenance permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the
rights-of-way as required.
      (2)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within twelve business hours.
      (4)   A right-of-way minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Right-of-way Minor Maintenance Permit Applications. Application for a
right-of-way minor maintenance permit shall be made to the Director of Public
Works. In addition to any information required by the Village, all right-of-way
minor maintenance permit applications shall contain, and will only be
considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the applicant has obtained a certificate of
registration or proof that the applicant has written authority to apply for a
right-of-way minor maintenance permit on behalf of a party that has been issued
a certificate of registration.
      (2)   Submission of a completed right-of-way minor maintenance permit
application in the form required by the Village.
      (3)   A statement that the applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the OMUTCD, will prevent injury or damage to
persons or property and to minimize disruptions to the efficient movement of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (c)   Issuance of Right-of-way Minor Maintenance Permits; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Director of Public Works determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this chapter and the right-of-way minor
maintenance permit process, the Director of Public Works shall issue a right-
of-way minor maintenance permit subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The Village may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the
rules and regulations enacted by the Village Engineer, upon the issuance of the
right-of-way minor maintenance permit and the performance of the right-of-way
minor maintenance permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Right-of-way Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Village shall not
charge a fee for the issuance of the right-of-way minor maintenance permit but
may revoke the right-of-way minor maintenance permit as any other permit may be
revoked under this chapter.
(Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.17 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application;
      (2)   To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the Village unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the Village
Treasurer and the Village Solicitor;
      (3)   To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Works, the issuance
of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event the
Director of Public Works, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Director of Public Works may deny a
permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users.
      (1)   The Director of Public Works, in his/her discretion, may consider
one or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit is
sought is available;
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-
way;
         C.   The availability of other locations in the rights-of-way or in
other rights-of-way for the proposed facilities;
         D.   The applicability of this chapter or other regulations of the
rights-of-way that affect location of facilities in the rights-of-way;
         E.   The degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of its certificate of registration, this chapter, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations;
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way;
         G.   The condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction;
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the rights-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the rights-of-way; and/or
         I.   Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of this chapter or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within twenty-four months after construction completion or a
newly reconstructed street within twenty-four months of reconstruction
completion, except where:
         A.   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.   The Village Engineer determines it is in the best interests of
the Village that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (a)(1) and (a)(2) of
this section, the Director of Public Works may issue a permit in any case where
the permit is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the
Village;
         B.   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Director of Public Works of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Village Engineer, after the occurrence or
discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter
for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the event that
the Village becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's facilities,
the Village shall use best efforts to contact the provider or the system
representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the Village may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, any provider who constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a rights-of-way without a valid
permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said
permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with the
Village the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights-of-way and
comply with all of the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The Village reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any law, or any provision or condition of
the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit;
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Village or its citizens;
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
         D.   The failure to maintain the required construction or removal
bonds and/or insurance;
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration;
         F.   The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant to
Section
911.15(g)(3).
      (2)   If the Director of Public Works determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
condition of the permit, the Director of Public Works shall serve a written
demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Public Works may place
additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Director of Public
Works with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Works, for its
correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Public Works, or
the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation
of the permit.
      (4)   If a permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will
not be allowed further permits for up to and including one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the
Village for the Village's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the
costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with
such revocation.
         (Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.18 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the Village and the county, shall deposit
with the Village an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety
bond in an amount determined by the Village Solicitor to be appropriate based
upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction default, problem or
deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public,
the Village shall serve written notice to the construction permittee detailing
the construction default, problem or deficiency. If the Village determines that
correction or repair of the construction default, problem or deficiency has not
occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten calendar days after
the date following service and notification and detailing the construction
default, problem or deficiency, then the Village may attach the letter of
credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the
construction permittee by the Village.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration and
continuously thereafter, and until 120 days after a provider's facilities have
been removed from the rights-of-way, (unless the Village notifies the provider
that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall deposit with the
Village and maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety
bond in an amount equal to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000), the Village shall make all reasonable efforts to allow provider a
period of five calendar days after serving notification in writing to correct
or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to the Village attachment of
the letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon
attachment, written notice shall be provided to the provider by the Village.
   (c)   Blanket Bond. In lieu of the construction bond required by division
(a) of this section and the removal bond required by division (b) of this
section, provider may deposit with the Village an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million dollars
($5,000,000). Unless a construction default problem or deficiency involves an
emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Village shall make
all reasonable effort to allow permittee a period of five calendar days after
sending notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or
deficiency prior to Village's attachment of the letter of credit or surety
bond.
   (d)   Self Bonding. In lieu of the construction bond required by division
(a) of this section, the removal bond required by division (b) of this section
and the blanket bond required by division (c) of this section, those providers
maintaining a book value in excess of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) may
submit a statement to the Village requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-
bond is granted, a provider shall assure the Village that such self-bonding
shall provide the Village with no less protection and security than would have
been afforded to the Village by a third party surety providing provider with
the types and amounts of bonds detailed in the above named divisions. This
statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program.
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Village.
   (e)   Purposes. The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee or provider's violation of this chapter or its failure to
comply with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the
Village issued pursuant to this chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the Village, including
permit fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to this chapter;
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights-of-way pursuant to this
chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the Village of any amounts for which the permittee
or provider is liable that are not paid by it's insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the Village
pursuant to this chapter or the law.
   (f)   Form. The bond documents required by this section and any replacement
bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the Facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to Village of
surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond."
(Ord. 05-2017. Passed 6-5-17.)
911.19 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   Village Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the acceptance of an
application, the grant of a permit or the issuance of a certificate of
registration, the Village does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service
claims; or
      (2)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification.
      (1)   By applying for and being issued a certificate of registration with
the Village a provider is required, or by accepting a permit a permittee is
required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Village's agents, elected
officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all costs,
liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of the
construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its
facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a rights-of-way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a permit. Such requirement to defend, indemnify and hold harmless shall not
extend to the negligence of the Village or its agents, elected officials,
officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors, to the extent that the
existence of such negligence shall be proven to exist. A provider or permittee
shall not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding
claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the Village's agents,
elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and subcontractors for any
claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance
or operation of its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or near a rights-
of-way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of
any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider, permittee or to
the Village; and the provider or permittee, in defending any action on behalf
of the Village, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the Village could assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise
of the above shall be consistent with, but not limited to, the following:
         A.   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Village, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the Village
or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees,
costs and expenses assumed by the Village in connection therewith);
         B.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the
rights-of-way, to which provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the Village's negligence or the
negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of
action, judgment, injury or damage;
         C.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the Village's actions; and
         D.   Arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with the
provisions of law applicable to provider or permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the Village:
         A.   Giving provider or permittee prompt notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         B.   Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to jointly
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperate in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the Village's
control.
      (3)   The Village shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if employed.

located within the rights-of-way, the provider and/or permittee shall so notify
the Director of Public Works within fourteen calendar days thereof and the
provider and/or permittee's certificate of registration or permit (as
applicable) shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect.
      (2)   The Village shall have the right to revoke, pursuant to the
provisions of the Code, any certificate of registration or permit granted

including the Bankruptcy Code, 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or
trustee to take over and conduct the business of the provider and/or permittee,
whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or
proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days or unless:

any certificate of registration or permit shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the substantive laws of the Village, State of Ohio and United
States, in that order. As a condition of the grant of any permit or issuance of
any certificate of registration, unless otherwise required by law, all disputes
shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction in Tuscarawas County,
Ohio.
   (f)   Force Majeure. In the event any person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by this chapter is prevented by a

result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within

operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the certificate of registration,
nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the Village as a
result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited
to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate
of registration or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise
of the Village's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the

921.02 USE OF PUBLIC AND BUILDING SEWERS.
   (a)   Connection With Sewer Required. No person shall maintain or use or
permit to be used upon any lot or land abutting upon or adjacent and accessible
to a public sanitary sewer any water closet, urinal or sink not connected with
such sewer in such manner as to properly discharge its contents into such
sewer. No abandoned well shall be used as a sink or privy vault.
   (b)   Discharge of Untreated Wastes to any Natural Outlet. No person shall
discharge into any natural outlet within the Village, or in any area under the
jurisdiction of the Village any sanitary sewage, industrial wastes or other
polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (c)   Discharge of Wastes to Storm Sewers. Wastes shall not be discharged
into a storm sewer unless the waste is of such character as would permit the
waste to be discharged directly to the body of water to which the storm sewer
discharges and be in compliance with all criteria and standards of discharge
established by the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs and other regulatory
agencies.
   (d)   Grease and Oil Interceptors. For grease, oil and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of
the Board, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in this section,
or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable
covers which, when bolted in place, shall be gas tight and watertight. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Board, and shall
be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
The owner shall provide and maintain all grease, oil and sand interceptors, at
his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. In the
maintenance of these interceptors the owner shall be responsible for the proper
removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall
maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Board. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by the owner's personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.
   (e)   Ground Garbage. The disposal of unground garbage to the sewer system
is prohibited. To prevent the disposal of solid industrial wastes and large
quantities of solid organic materials as ground garbage, garbage grinder
installations are restricted to locations where food is prepared for
consumption on the premises.
   Four requirements for “properly ground garbage” are:
(1)   Only food wastes be considered as garbage;
(2)   All ground particles be of such size that they will be carried freely
under the normal flow conditions prevailing in the sewer conduit to which they
are contributory;
(3)   Installation of a garbage grinder with a three-fourths horsepower, or
greater, motor is subject to approval of the Board or its authorized
representative; and
(4)   Limitations on acceptable garbage grinder operation specify that not more
than thirty percent (30%), on the dry basis, pass a No. 40 U.S. Standard sieve.
   (f)   Industrial Agreements. No statement contained in this chapter shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
payment therefore by the industrial concern as subsequently provided.
   (g)   Privies, Privy Vaults, Septic Tanks, Cesspools Prohibited; Exceptions.
Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall construct or maintain any
privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used
for the disposal of sewage.
   (h)   Prohibition of Unpolluted Water. No person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any unpolluted stormwater, surface water, ground water, roof
runoff, sub-surface drainage, cooling water or unpolluted industrial process
waters to any sanitary sewers.
   (i)   Sewer Pipe Ventilation. No sewer pipe for a water closet or any other
connection shall be allowed inside any house or building unless proper means
are provided for the ventilation of such pipe or sewer so as to effectually
prevent sewer gas from entering the house or building.
   (j)   Storm and Surface Waters. All surface runoff from areas expected to
yield good quality water such as roofs, paved areas, lawns and discharges from
ground water collection systems must be excluded from the sanitary sewers.
Basements shall be drained to the sanitary sewers because the wastewaters from
washing machines, portable laundry tubs and shower baths can cause gross
pollution of storm sewer outlets. Foundation drains are required to be
discharged to a storm sewer. Unpolluted water from air-conditioning systems,
industrial cooling operations, and so forth shall be discharged to the storm
sewers or directly to natural drainage outlets.
   (k)   Substances Limited. The following described substances, materials,
waters or wastes shall be limited in discharges to Municipal systems to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The Board may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if, in its opinion, more
severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. Deliberate
dilution with unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in the
regulations below shall not be acceptable. In forming its opinion as to the
acceptability, the Board will give consideration to such facts as the quantity
of such waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity
of the wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations
or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewater
discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval
of the Board are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150°F.
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oils, products of mineral oil origin,
floatable oils, fat, wax and grease.
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders
may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage
originates from the preparation of food in the kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers.
      (4)   Any waters or wastes containing solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to
injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the
receiving waters of the Wastewater Treatment Plant including but not limited to
cyanides, hexavalent chromium, copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and phenols in the
wastes as discharged to the public sewer. Maximum concentrations of these
substances may be changed as necessary by the Board of Public Affairs based on
new information from State regulatory agencies concerning inhibitory substances
or to protect treatment plant processes. Industrial discharges covered by
Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet those limitations specified under
effluent guidelines published under Section 304(b) and 307(b) of the Federal
Act or the above concentrations, whichever is more stringent.
Major contributing industries discharging incompatible pollutants into the
public sewers shall be regulated as provided in Section 921.06.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Board or any local or State regulatory
agencies.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations.
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute “slug”
as defined herein.
      (8)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer system, release noxious gases, form suspended solids which
interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes.
   (l)   Substances Prohibited. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any of the following described materials into the public sewers, or
treatment works.
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, cleaning solvents, paint
vehicles or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas;
      (2)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 6.0 or higher than 9.0
or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment and personnel of the wastewater treatment works;
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interferences with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc.,
either whole or ground by garbage grinders. Direct discharge of such materials
as tar, asphalt, paint and waxes shall also be prohibited because they may
adhere to sewers and thus reduce the effective size of the pipe;
      (4)   Any garbage which has not been properly shredded; or
      (5)   Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance capable of creating a
public nuisance.
   (m)   Toilet Facilities and Connections Required. The owner of all houses,
buildings or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or
other purpose, situated within the Village and abutting on any street, alley or
right of way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a
public sanitary sewer of the Village, is hereby required at his expense to
install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities
directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter, within 120 days after the date of the official notice provided such
public sewer is within 200 feet of the structure(s).
   (n)   Extension of Time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances
exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with
the time schedule imposed by this chapter, a request for extension of time may
be presented for consideration of the Board. All requests for extension of time
shall be submitted in writing, stating the reasons for such a request. Under no
circumstances shall the extension of the time exceed thirty days after approval
of the extension by the Board.
   (o)   When Preliminary Treatment Required. The admission into the public
sewers of any waters or wastes having characteristics which vary from normal
sewage shall be subject to the review and approval of the Board. When
necessary, in the opinion of the Board, such preliminary treatment facilities
as may be needed to control the quantities and rates of discharge or reduce
objectionable characteristics or constituents shall be constructed according to
plans approved by the Village. Where preliminary treatment facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (p)   When Private System Required. Where a public sanitary sewer is not
available, the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal
system complying with the provisions of this section.
   (q)   Conflict With Requirements of Health Officer. No statement contained
in this section shall be construed to interfere with any additional
requirements that may be imposed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (r)   Connection to Public Sewer Required When Available. At such time as a
public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage
disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in
compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar
private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable
material. This connection shall be made upon within 120 days upon notification
of sewer being available for use.
   (s)   Compliance Required. All private sewers and sewage disposal systems
shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this chapter.

layout of a private sewage disposal system shall comply with all
recommendations of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. No septic tank or
cesspool shall be permitted to discharge to any public sewer or natural outlet.
   (u)   Owner's Responsibility. Sanitary sewer laterals are considered to be
the sole property of the sanitary sewer user, and as such, it is the individual
responsibility of each user to finance, install according to Village ordinances
and with approved materials, maintain and repair the lateral from the sanitary
sewer main to the structure which it serves. The owner, and/or contractor shall
indemnify the Village from any loss, damage or costs that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by the installation and/or maintenance and operation
of any building sewer. Section 921.03(f).
   (v)   Required Improvements. The Village may require improvements to private
sewers to reduce infiltration and/or inflow or require a sewage meter be
installed to meter the infiltration and/or inflow to determine an accurate
sewage charge.
   (w)   Sanitary Operation and Maintenance. The owner shall operate and
maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a safe and sanitary manner
at all times at no expense to the Village.
   (x)   When Permit Effective; Inspection of Work. A permit for a private
sewage disposal system shall not become effective until the installation is
completed to the satisfaction of the Board. The Board or its representative
shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction and, in any
event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Board when the work is
ready for final inspection and before any underground portions are covered. The
inspection shall be made within twenty-four hours of the receipt of notice by
the Board or his duly authorized representative.

required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work
unless otherwise requested by the Board. Whenever possible the building sewer
shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No
building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing
wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford
protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in
straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only
with proper fittings.
   (d)   EPA Standard Applies. Sewers shall be designed in accordance with the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Design Guidelines.
   (e)   Independent Sewers Required; Exceptions. A separate and independent
building sewer shall be provided for every building. However, where one
building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer
is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining
alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer. Adjacent buildings under one roof may use a common building sewer of
appropriate size, however, a separate permit shall be required for each
building. No other utilities will be permitted in the same trench as the
building sewer.
(Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80; Am. Ord. 5-99. Passed 3-23-99.)

be subject to the approval of the Board, but in no event shall the diameter be
less than four inches, except when engineering requirements necessitate a
smaller diameter for efficient operation of the building sewer lateral. The
slope of such pipe may be not less than one-eighth inch per foot.
(Ord. 12-85. Passed 8-5-85; Am. Ord. 5-99. Passed 3-23-99.)
   (g)   Lifting Sewage by Artificial Means. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer.
   (h)   Removal of Sewer by Municipality; Charges a Lien. The Board may cause
to be taken up or removed any drain or sewer constructed in violation of this
section so far as the same is within the limits of any property, thereby
disconnecting such sewer or drain from any public sewer. The costs and expenses
of removal shall constitute a charge against the owner of and be a lien upon
the property intended to be drained by such drain or sewer, and if not paid
upon demand by the Board the same shall be certified to the Tuscarawas County
Auditor to be placed upon the duplicate, or shall be otherwise collected.
   (I)   Type of Pipe Required. The building sewer shall be of the best quality
vitrified clay sewer pipe, (ASTM C700 extra strength), with precast plastic or
O-ring joints; or Polyvinyl chlorine, (PVC), plastic pipe, (ASTM 3034 and SDR-
35), with elastomeric gasket joint-integral bell type; or ABS plastic truss
(composite) pipe (ASTM D2680) for eight-inch diameter and larger, ABS solid
wall pipe (ASTM D2661 or ASTM D2751) for six-inch diameter.
Joints for ABS pipe shall be chemically welded, solid ABS couplings, on the

   (j)   Use of Old Sewers for Buildings. Old building sewers may be used only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Board, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80; Am. Ord. 5-99. Passed 3-23-99.)
921.04 CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC SEWERS AND BUILDING SEWERS.
   (a)   Sewer Contractor License Required. Only persons, firms, companies or
corporations of proven ability, and approved by the Village, shall be permitted
to construct building sewers and connections. Such persons, firms, companies or
corporations shall obtain a yearly license therefore, and shall further obtain
a permit for the construction of any building sewer, sewer connection or repair
from the Village. Such license shall be approved and signed by the Mayor and
shall expire on the 31st day of December of the year in which it was issued.
This license may be revoked at any time by the Village for any violation of the
regulations governing Sewer Contractors. The fee for the license shall be
twenty five dollars ($25.00). The Sewer Contractor shall take out and maintain
Worker's Compensation Insurance during the life of his obligation to the
Village. The Contractor shall provide to the Village proof of compliance with
the Worker's Compensation laws and the Social Security laws. Certificates of
insurance policies shall be provided in the types and amounts acceptable to the
Village.
   (b)   Sewer Contractor Bond. To be a licensed Sewer Contractor in the
Village a minimum bond of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) is required. The
duration of such bond shall be no less than one year after all work has been
completed. Such bond shall be firmly bound unto the Village and shall fully
indemnify and save harmless the Village from all costs and damages which it may
suffer by reason of the Sewer Contractor's failure to perform its duties, and
all the undertakings involving work associated with the Village sewerage
system.
   (c)   Permit Required. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any
connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or
appurtenances thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the
Village. (See Appendix C, Application for Building Sewer Installation and
Appendix D, Building Sewer Installation Information.)
   (d)   Noncompliance. If any Sewer Contractor shall neglect or refuse to
comply with the rules and regulations set forth herein, within twenty-four
hours after receiving written notice from the Village, the Board of Trustees of
Public Affairs will proceed with the work and the cost involved will be charged
to the Sewer Contractor or his Surety. In cases where it is necessary for the
Village to proceed with the work, no further permits will be granted to the
Sewer Contractor until he has satisfactorily complied with the orders of the
Village or completely reimbursed the Village for any cost involved. The Sewer
Contractor shall be required for a period of one year after the completion of
the work, to make all necessary repairs.
   (e)   Construction Procedure. Any Sewer Contractor before laying pipe or
making the connection to any wye, tee, riser or crossover shall uncover both
appurtenances to same to ascertain their condition. No sewer pipe shall be laid
before the Superintendent is on the job. The Sewer Contractor shall determine
the slope of the building sewer from the elevations of the existing sewer
connection and the connection at the building with the minimum slope being in
accordance with Section 921.03. Should there not be enough fall available to
provide minimum slope, the Superintendent shall be advised immediately. Sewer
pipe laying shall start at the connection to the main sewer. The Sewer
Contractor shall connect the sewer to the building drain which extends at least
three feet beyond the outside wall of the building. At this point the sewer
contractor shall install a joint adaptor, to adapt the building drain to the
building sewer.
   (f)   Applicant to Notify When Work Ready for Inspection and Connection. The
applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Superintendent twenty-
four hours before an inspection and connection to the public sewer is to be
made. All notifications of this kind shall include the permit number and the
location. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Superintendent or his representative. The Superintendent, or any person
authorized by him, must be permitted at all times to inspect all work, material
and fixtures.
   (g)   Barricades and Warning Lights; Restoration. All excavations for a
building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways,
sewers and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be
restored in a manner satisfactory to the Village. All excavations in roadway
areas shall be backfilled with well compacted sand or gravel, tamped in place.
   (h)   Installation. The requirements for bedding, haunching, initial
backfilling shall be in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Bedding. A minimum layer of six-inch bedding consisting of #67
granular or fill-sand bedding material shall be provided upon a stable
undisturbed subgrade. If an unstable subgrade is encountered, the Board or its
duly authorized representative shall determine the method of building the
required subgrade support.
      (2)   Haunching. After the pipe has been placed on the approved bedding
material, #67 granular material fill-sand shall be placed around the sides of
the pipe from the undisturbed trench wall to the pipe. Under no circumstances
shall the maximum allowable trench width for the type, size and depth or pipe
be exceeded. Unless otherwise approved or ordered, the maximum allowable trench
widths measured at the top of the pipe shall be twenty-seven-inches for six and
eight-inch diameter pipe, thirty-inches for ten-inch diameter pipe and thirty-
three inches for twelve-inch diameter pipe.
      (3)   Initial backfill. No backfill shall be placed until after
inspection is completed by the Board or the duly authorized representative.
After the haunching of the pipe has been completed, the pipe shall be covered
by #67 granular material or fill-sand to a plane, six-inches above the top of
the pipe.
      (4)   Backfill. Upon completion of the initial backfill, the best
excavated material shall be used for backfilling the trench. Trash, boulders,
frozen soil etc., shall not be used as backfill material. If the pipe is laid
under a pavement or
berm area, the pipe shall be backfilled with approved granular material, a
minimum of five-feet beyond the edge of the berm or edge of pavement in absence
of a berm.
   (i)   Repairs. A building sewer permit shall be required for all repair work
performed by the sewer contractor except cases where excavation is not
necessary. In the case of stoppages, it shall be the responsibility of the
sewer contractor to uncover the wye, tee or riser, if the property is on the
same side as the main sewer. When property is on the opposite side, the end of
the Village crossover shall be uncovered to determine where the trouble lies.
If the stoppage is found to be either in the main line or in the Village
crossover, the sewer contractor shall notify the Village immediately, whose
responsibility it shall be to repair same. The cost of the permit will then be
returned to the sewer contractor. If the stoppage is located anywhere else in
the line, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to repair same at his own
cost and expense.
   (j)   Abandoned Laterals. Sanitary sewers in buildings to be demolished
shall be permanently sealed, in a manner acceptable to the Board, before
demolition is started.
   (k)   Service Extension Outside the Municipality. The owners of the premises
outside the Village who desire sewer service shall pay the cost of materials
and labor for the extensions of such services outside the Village limits. Such
cost shall be paid by the owners of parcels served and benefited. All sewer
service extensions shall be subject to the applicable conditions set forth in
this chapter. The owners of the premises outside the Village who desire sewer
service shall comply with such regulations for such services and shall pay such
rates and charges incidental to such services as may be established from time
to time by the Village, and that meet the user charge system criteria as
required by the Regional Administrator of U.S. EPA.
   (l)   Submission of Plans. Upon completion of construction, drawings shall
be corrected by the sewer contractor to represent the recorded elevations,
grades and sizes. One producible print shall be supplied to the Village.
(Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80; Am. Ord. 5-99. Passed 3-23-99.)
921.05 PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   Application and Fee. Except in the case of property owned by the
Village, no person, corporation, partnership, association or public agency
whatsoever shall connect, or cause to be connected, any building, structure of
other facility, either directly or indirectly, with a sanitary sewer in the
Newcomerstown Sanitary Sewer District which has or will have its ultimate
outlet at the Newcomerstown WWTP for the purpose of discharging sanitary wastes
or acceptable industrial wastes from such premises without first receiving a
permit for such purpose. The owner or his agent shall make application on a
special form furnished by the Village. The permit application shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered
pertinent in the judgment of the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs. A permit
fee outlined in Section 921.08 shall be paid to the Water Department Clerk at
the time the application is filed.
   (b)   Permit Required for Private Sewage Disposal System. Before
construction of a structure requiring the installation of a private sewage
disposal system, the owner or
agent shall obtain written permission to install a private sewage disposal
system from the Board and an Installation and Operation Permit from The
Tuscarawas County General Health District.
   The application for the Permit to Install shall be made on a form acceptable
to the Board of Public Affairs and shall contain all pertinent information
required. This application shall be accompanied by a fee determined by the
Board.
   (c)   Tampering with or Damaging Works Prohibited. No person shall
maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface
or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the
Wastewater Treatment Works.
   (d)   Notice to Correct or Cease Violation. Any person found to be violating
any provision of this chapter, except as provided in division (c) of this
section, shall be served by the Village with written notice stating the nature
of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory
correction thereof. The offender shall, within a period of time stated in such
notice, permanently cease all violations.
   (e)   Powers and Authority of Inspectors. Employees of the Village, duly
authorized by the Board and bearing proper credentials and identification shall
be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to discharge to the
wastewater treatment works in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
The authorized employees of the Village are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial or commercial processes which have a direct bearing on
the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater treatment works. A user may
withhold information considered confidential. A user must establish that the
revelation to the public of the information in question might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   While performing the necessary work on private properties, the authorized
employees of the Village shall observe all safety rules applicable to the
premises established by the owner, and the owner shall be held harmless for
injury or death to the Village employees, and the Village shall indemnify the
owner against loss or damage to its property by Village employees and against
liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted
against the owner and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except
as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the owner to maintain safe
conditions.
   (f)   Board of Trustees of Public Affairs to Make Rules; Appeals. The Board
shall make and enforce rules and regulations, subject to approval of Council,
establishing the types and characteristics of sanitary sewage and industrial
wastes, and other matters not specifically covered in this chapter which shall
not be discharged into the Village sewerage system, and the types and
characteristics of sanitary sewerage and industrial wastes admissible to the
Village sewerage system only after pretreatment. Such rules and regulations
shall be subject to appeal to Council, which shall appoint three reputable and
qualified persons to investigate a the appeal and agree to affirm or reject the
ruling of the Board.
   (g)   Inspection of New Laterals. The building sewer lateral and its
connection into the main sanitary sewer shall be left exposed for inspection
and approval by the Board or its duly authorized agent. Upon approval, the
Board will authorize the placing of backfill over the connection and pipe at
which time the building sewer lateral may be used for its intended purpose.
   (h)   Notification. Prior to commencing any construction of public or
building sewers a minimum of twenty- four hours notice shall be given to the
office of the Board. No construction of sewers shall be allowed on legal
holidays, Saturdays, Sundays or after 4:30 p.m. unless written permission is
obtained from the Board. The Board may require payment by the Contractor or
inspection costs for work performed on days and at times listed in the written
permission.
(Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80; Am. Ord. 5-99. Passed 3-23-99.)
921.06 CONTROL OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Normal Concentrations of Wastes. User Charges pursuant to Sanitary
Sewer charges shall apply to wastes not exceeding normal concentrations as
follows:
      (1)   BOD - 240 milligrams per liter;
      (2)   Suspended Solids - 240 milligrams per liter;
   Applicable concentrations shall be based on average concentrations, weighted
in proportion to volume of flow, determined during each billing period by the
most practicable method possible. Should the average concentration of any
constituent exceed the normal concentration provided in this Section, a User
Charge Surcharge for constituent(s) exceeded shall apply for the applicable
billing period, in accordance with the sanitary sewer charges.
   (b)   Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges. If any wastes are
discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the wastewater treatment works
which contain pollutants in excess of normal concentrations as defined above
and/or possess characteristics which, in the judgment of the Board, may have a
deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment works or receiving waters,
including violation of applicable NPDES permit, of which otherwise creates a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Board shall:
      (1)   Reject the wastes; or
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the wastewater treatment works; and/or
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment of surcharges as provided previously to cover the
added cost of handling and treating the wastes.
   Roof drains, foundation drains and all other clear water connections to the
sanitary sewer are prohibited.
   (c)   Industrial Wastes.
      (1)   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall, as a minimum, meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations
Part 128 unless the Village is committed, in its NPDES permit, to remove a
specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances the
applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels
determined by the Board or its duly authorized representative or State
regulatory agencies.
      (2)   If the Board requires pretreatment or equalization of waste flow,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Board and State regulatory agencies and subject to
the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (d)   Submission of Basic Data. Within ninety days after passage of this
chapter, each person whose operation entails the discharge of industrial wastes
to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the Board of Trustees of Public
Affairs, a written statement setting forth the nature of the operation
contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of water required
for use, the proposed point of discharge of such wastes into the wastewater
collection system of the Village, the estimated amount to be so discharged and
a fair statement setting forth the expected bacterial, physical, chemical and
other known characteristics of such wastes. Within a reasonable time of receipt
of such statement, the Village shall make an order stating such minimum
restrictions as in the judgment of the Board may be necessary to adequately
guard against unlawful uses of the Village's wastewater system. When it can be
demonstrated that circumstances exist which would create an unreasonable burden
on the person to comply with this time schedule, a request for extension of
time may be presented for consideration of the Board. All requests for
extension of time shall be submitted in writing, stating the reasons for such a
request. Under no circumstances shall the extension of time exceed sixty days
after approval of the extension by the Board.
   (e)   Oil and Grease. If oils and grease are biodegradable and in a physical
state that does not cause clogging or undue maintenance problems in the
wastewater facilities, the discharge of these substances can be accepted in a
wastewater treatment system. Animal and vegetable oils and grease, polar
substances, are readily degradable in aerobic and anaerobic biological
treatment systems provided that the physical states of the oils and grease do
not prevent the necessary contact with the biological suspensions responsible
for treatment. However, oils and grease of mineral origin, primarily nonpolar
substances, are essentially non-biodegradable either in aerobic or anaerobic
processes and should be removed from industrial wastes to the maximum degree
practical before discharge. The discharge of these oils and greases of mineral
origin shall be limited to the regulation of the Village. Grease separators are
required for all meat packing plants and on building sewers serving hotels,
restaurants and institutions in which large numbers of meals are served.
However, the use of garbage grinders precludes the use of gravity grease
separators. Flammable waste and grit intercepting facilities must be provided
on all building sewers from garages, filling stations, cleaning establishments
and other concerns using volatile oils or solvents. Special pretreatment
methods are required for the removal of soluble cutting oils. All grease and
oil removal facilities must be approved by the Board.
   (f)   Wastewater Volume Determination. The quantity subject to the charges
imposed by this chapter shall be the volume of wastes discharged to the
wastewater treatment works by the user. This volume shall be the same volume as
that recorded on the meter or meters used to measure water from the public
water systems, unless the user is supplied with water from a source other than
the public water system and/or unless a substantial volume of water supplied to
the user is not discharged to the wastewater treatment works; in which cases,
the volume of water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be
determined by one or more meters installed to measure water flow and/or
wastewater discharged, or by other means approved by the Village. Pursuant to
the provisions of Industrial Cost Recovery, industrial wastes, as distinct from
domestic wastes, from an industry shall be determined in a similar manner.
Meters installed other than the meter or meters used to record consumption from
the public water system shall be approved by the Village and installed at the
expense of the user. Following approval, such meter(s) shall not be removed
without the consent of the Village. Wherever more than one family unit or more
than one business, professional or commercial establishment or a combination of
one or more family units, business, professional or commercial establishments
are supplied by one water meter, then the sanitary sewer charge shall be
applied to each family, business, professional or commercial establishment in
the same manner as though a separate water service and meter supplied each
family or each business, professional or commercial establishment. This section
shall include, but shall not be limited to, mobile homes.
   (g)   Sampling and Monitoring.
      (1)   Industrial wastes discharged to the wastewater treatment works
shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of the wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may be
deemed necessary by the Village. The user shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
      (2)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall preferably be accomplished
by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite
samples. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to insure
their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was
taken.
   (h)   Control Manhole. When required by the Board, a user shall install one
or more suitable structures, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances, in the building sewer(s) to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such structure(s), when required, shall be
accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the Board. The structure(s) and appurtenances shall be installed by
the user at its expense and shall be maintained by the user so as to be safe
and accessible at all times.
   (i)   Testing.
      (1)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association,
unless such standards conflict with regulations promulgated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 136 - “Guidelines Establishing
Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants”, in which case, the regulations
promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency shall govern. Sampling
methods, location, times, duration and frequencies shall be determined on an
individual basis subject to approval by the Board or its duly authorized
representative.
      (2)   All costs incident to sampling and analysis shall be borne by the
user. Such costs incurred by the Village on behalf of the user shall be billed
annually to the user, based on the actual cost to the Village, plus reasonable
overhead. Such billing shall be billed with, and be considered a part of, the
sewer service charge for the month billed.
   (j)   Discharge of Wastes to Storm Sewers. Wastes shall not be discharged
into a storm sewer unless the waste is of such character as would permit the
waste to be discharged directly to the body of water to which the storm sewer
discharges and be in compliance with all criteria and standards of discharge
established by regulatory agencies.
(Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80; Ord. 8-05. Passed 8-15-05.)
921.07 SANITARY SEWER CHARGES.
   (a)   Components. Sanitary sewer charges shall consist of two components, as
listed herein. In addition, some of the components shall be subdivided into
other components.
      (1)   User Charge.
      (2)   User Charge - Surcharge.
   (b)   Applicability of Charges. Users shall be subject to the various
components of charges initially on the basis of their user class, as
subsequently provided under the divisions describing each component.
(Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80.)
   (c)   User Charge. The sewage usage rates for the waste water treatment
facilities for the Village and all subscribers shall be at the rate of two
dollars and fifty-four cents ($2.54) per one thousand (1,000) gallons,
effective March 1, 1999 and shall be at the rate of two dollars and sixty-nine
cents ($2.69) per one thousand gallons effective January 1, 2000. Beginning
January 1, 2001 the sewage usage rates shall increase at the rate of .01%
annually thereafter.
(Ord. 6-99. Passed 3-23-99.)
   (d)   User Charge - Surcharge. In addition to the User Charges applicable
pursuant to this Section, users discharging pollutants to the wastewater
treatment works in concentrations exceeding normal as defined in Section 921.06
(a), shall be subject to a User Charge - Surcharge, which shall be calculated
as follows:
User Charge - Surcharge
BOD = (B-200) x QI x 0.00834 x Cto x 0.30; and/or
                                                          
         Bt
Suspended Solids = (S-240) x QI x 0.00834 x Cto x 0.30
                                                                      
               St
Where:
       B = BOD concentration (in mg/l)
S = Suspended Solids concentration (in mg/l);
       QI = User discharge (in 1,000 gal.);
Cto = Estimated Total Annual Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Costs
    0.30 = Portion of Cto assigned to BOD:
   0.30 = Portion of Cto assigned to Suspended Solids;
Bt = Estimated Total Annual Pounds of BOD received at the WWTP;
St = Estimated Total Annual Pounds of Suspended Solids received at the WWTP:
   0.00834 = Constant (8.34 pounds x 1,000)
gal. 1,000,000
   The actual surcharge is $0.21/lb for BOD and $0.18/lb for Suspended Solids.
   (e)   Surcharge for Other Pollutants. Surcharges may also be established for
pollutants other than those provided for which are permitted to be discharged
to the wastewater treatment works by the Village, after pretreatment, or
without pretreatment.
   (f)   Administration of Industrial Cost Recovery. Industrial cost recovery
shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 35.928.
Industrial users discharging the equivalent of 25,000 gpd or less of sanitary
waste shall be exempt from industrial cost recovery requirements, provided the
waste discharged does not contain any pollutants which:
      (1)   Interfere with wastewater treatment works processes;
      (2)   Are incompatible; or
      (3)   Contaminates or reduces the utility of the sludge.
   (g)   User Classes.
      (1)   The placement of a user within a particular user class for applying
User Charges shall be as determined by Council. There are currently no
industries meeting the definition of an “Industrial User” as defined in 40 CFR
35.905.
      (2)   Should such an “Industrial User” begin to discharge into the
Village system, an ICR system shall be implemented in accordance with current
Federal regulations.
   All users not defined as an Industrial User per Federal Regulation No.
35.905.8 Industrial User, shall be placed in the Non-Industrial User class.
   (h)   Annual Rate Review. The sanitary sewer charge rates shall assure that
each recipient of waste treatment services will pay its proportionate share of
the cost of operation and maintenance including replacement. Revenue generated
shall be proportionate to the portion of operation and maintenance necessary.
These rates shall be reviewed biennially and shall be reviewed periodically, as
required, to reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance.
   (i)   Audit, Review and Adjustment. Revenues, expenses, consumptions,
loadings and other data associated with sanitary sewer charges shall be audited
annually. All estimated revenues, expenses, consumptions, loadings, allocation
factors, etc., shall be reviewed and adjusted annually so as to more accurately
reflect current conditions and adjust for past inequities. One of the main
purposes of the audit shall be to maintain a proportionate distribution of the
wastewater treatment works operation and maintenance costs, including billing,
to all users by means of the user charge system, and to insure that user
charges are sufficient to cover all operation and maintenance costs, including
billing. Within the limitations of all applicable Federal, State and local
laws, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency shall have the right to audit
industrial waste discharge records.
   (j)   Sanitary Sewer Charges Outside the Municipality. With respect to any
such premises situated outside of the corporate limits of the Village, and
having active connections with the system pursuant to authorization of Council,
sanitary sewer charges shall be 37% greater than the charges for service inside
the corporate limits.
   (k)   Method of Collecting Charges. The sanitary sewer charges provided in
this chapter shall be payable monthly at the Water Department during regular
office hours. Charges established with respect to premises served by the
Village Water Works system shall be included in and payable with the Village
water bill to such premises. With respect to premises not so served, charges
shall be billed and payable at the same times as the Village water bills are
rendered and become payable. The billing and collection of Sanitary Sewer
Charges, Permit Charges and Quarterly or Monthly Base Charges shall be the
responsibility of the Village. The same shall be subject to and governed by the
valid and applicable rules and regulations from time to time established by the
Village. Surcharges levied pursuant to this chapter shall be billed annually or
as otherwise established by Council.
   (l)   Nonpayment of Bill. When any charges imposed by this chapter is not
paid within the specified due date, they may after ninety days be certified
with a penalty of ten percent (10%) to the Tuscarawas County Auditor who shall
place them upon the real property tax list and duplicate against the property
served. Such charges and penalties shall be a lien on such property from the
date the same was placed upon the real property tax lien and duplicate by the
County Auditor and shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes. The
Village shall have the right in the event of nonpayment to discontinue water
service to such premises until the unpaid charges have been paid in full.
   (m)   Special Contracts. The Village has the right to contract with special
users when agreement schedules and charges are in accordance with prevailing
rates of this chapter.
   (n)   Sanitary Sewer District Accounts.
      (1)   Revenues generated through user charges levied pursuant to this
Section and permit charges levied pursuant to this chapter shall be placed in a
separate account and shall be used to offset all operation and maintenance
costs, including billing.
      (2)   All other revenues generated through monthly base charges,
excluding user charges, shall be placed in a separate account for the purpose
of covering other applicable payments for the Newcomerstown Sanitary Sewer
District.
         (Ord. 6-80. Passed 5-19-80; Ord. 8-05. Passed 8-15-05.)
   (o)   Surcharge for Sludge Press. Editor’s note: The one dollar sewer
surcharge for the sludge press was removed, effective for services in March,
2005, by the passage of Ordinance 4-05, passed April 18, 2005.

conditions of the property would render compliance with the provisions of this
chapter difficult and likely result in a particular hardship on the owner, as
distinguished from inconvenience of the chapter requirements or a desire to
increase financial gain or avoid the financial expense of compliance.
      (2)   The type of sign structure and the location proposed would not pose
a significant risk to the public health, safety and welfare.
      (3)   The benefit of the sign to the general public and/or applicant
under the circumstances outweighs any risk to traffic safety and the Village
desire to eliminate the accumulation of visual clutter in accordance with
stated purpose of this chapter.

against the spirit and intent of the chapter.
   (c)   In issuing a variance from the strict letter of the provisions of this

Village Council. The Village Council may grant a variance of any sign
requirement or place reasonable conditions or restrictions upon issuance of a
