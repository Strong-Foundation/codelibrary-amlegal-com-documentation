THAT WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Delta, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time;
and
WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter to

NOW, THEREFORE, Be it Ordained, by the Council of the Village of Delta, Ohio,
as Follows:
SECTION 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Delta, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Delta, Ohio.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Delta, Ohio.
SECTION 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in

affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

EDITOR'S NOTE
 
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
    This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (a)   Any person, upon written request and as provided herein, may obtain

CHAPTER 107
Public Records Policy
107.01   Purpose.
107.02   Custodian of public records; when available.
107.03   General provisions.
107.04   Compliance.
 
 
107.01 PURPOSE.
   The Village of Delta maintains many records that are used in the
administration and operation of the Village. In accordance with State law, the
Village of Delta Records Commission has adopted a schedule of records retention
and disposition that identify these records and this schedule is available in
the Village Administrator's office and in each department. This schedule lists
generally the types of records that are stored on a fixed medium (paper,
computer, film, etc.) that are created, received, or sent under the
jurisdiction of the Village and document the organization, functions, policies,
decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Village. The
records maintained by the Village and the ability to access them are means to
provide trust between the public and the Village.
(Ord. 08-11. Passed 10-20-08.)
107.02 CUSTODIAN OF PUBLIC RECORDS; WHEN AVAILABLE.
   (a)   The Clerk of Council is the official Public Records Custodian for the
Village Council. Department heads are the official custodians of all records
maintained within their departments. Public records requests may be made
directly to Department heads or through the Public Records Custodian. Requests
for records from the police department may be made directly to the police
records clerk at the Village of Delta Police Department.
   (b)   Public records requests will be accommodated during regular business
hours when offices maintaining said records are open for business. Public
records requests will not be accepted on weekends or Village approved holidays.
(Ord. 08-11. Passed 10-20-08.)
107.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Public Records. Public records include the following: Any document,
paper, electronic, or other format, that is created or received by, or comes
under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the organization,
functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of
the office. All records of the Village of Delta are public unless they are
specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code or Federal law.
   It is the policy of the Village of Delta that records will be organized and
maintained so that they are readily available for inspection and copying.
   (b)   Record Requests.
      (1)   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response
using the following guidelines:
         A.   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the Public Records Custodian must
contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in
revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the
office keeps its records.
         B.   The Public Records Custodian may ask the requester to put a
verbal request in writing, may ask for the requester to give identifying
information, or may inquire about the intended use of the information; but a
written request is not mandatory, identifying information is not required and
the intended use does not have to be disclosed. However, providing such
information would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the Public
Records Custodian to identify, locate and deliver the public records requested.
      (2)   Public records can be accessed by one of the following methods: a
request to view public records in person; a request for copies of public
records that the requester will personally pick up from the Public Records
Custodian; or a request for copies of public records that the requester wants
to have mailed or otherwise transmitted to the requester.
      (3)   Public records must be made available for inspection promptly.
Copies of public records must be made available within a reasonable period of
time. "Prompt" and "reasonable" take into account the volume of records
requested; the proximity of the location where the records are stored; and the
necessity for any legal review of the records requested. Each request should be
evaluated for an estimated length of time required to gather the records.
      (4)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged in writing by the public office within three business days
following the office's receipt of the request. If a request is deemed
significantly beyond "routine," such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgement must include the
following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (c)   Transmitting Copies of Public Records.
      (1)   A requester may request that copies of public records be
transmitted to him or her by U.S. Mail or by any other means of transmission
that is available and is conducive to transmitting the public records. The cost
of transmission must be paid by the requester before the public records will be
provided. Public records to be transmitted by United States mail are limited to
ten (10) per month unless the requester certifies to the Village of Delta that
the requester does not intend to use or forward the requested records, or the
information contained in them, for commercial purposes as defined by Ohio R.C.
149.43(B)(7).
      (2)   While the Village is under no obligation to provide records in
electronic format, it is the policy of the Village to provide information to
the public in the most practical and convenient manner, considering all of the
circumstances. It is the Public Records Custodian's discretion whether the
information requested will be generated and released in an electronic format.
Any document transmitted electronically shall be in PDF format, or some other
non-editable format.
   (d)   Fees and Payment.
      (1)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost
of making copies or printing pictures and shall also pay the actual cost (e.g.
postage) of delivery and other supplies used in mailing, delivery or
transmission of the public record.
         (2)   Copies made on letter or legal size paper are $0.05 per page. If
the Public Records Custodian uses an outside copying service to make the
copies, the requester will be required to pay the cost of the entire copying
job, as billed by the copying service. Copies that are requested in some format
other than normal letter or legal paper will be "at cost," without taking into
account employee time spent preparing the copies.
      (3)   For video tapes, cassette tapes or for any other type of media, the
fee shall be the replacement cost or the reproduction cost. Reproduction costs
may only be charged if a commercial or professional service is contracted to
provide the service.
      (4)   Public records will only be copied by the Public Records Custodian
or other authorized officers, employees or representatives. The Public Records
Custodian may use an outside copying service to make the copies, at the Public
Records Custodian's discretion. Under no circumstances will the requester be
permitted to make the copies him or herself
      (5)   No fee will be charged if fewer than 20 pages of copies. All
requests exceeding 20 pages will be charged a fee of $0.05 per page for all
pages copied. All copying costs are to be paid before the records are copied.
Regardless of the number of copies, the requester shall pay the cost of postage
if U.S. mail delivery has been requested.
      (6)   Ohio law may provide for specific fees to be charged for certain
records such as police accident reports at $3.00 each, with photographs at an
additional cost, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5502.12. These amounts are subject to
change with amendments to the legislation.
   (e)   Denial of a Public Records Request.
      (1)   Under certain circumstances, records are not defined as "public
records" under Ohio law or are exempt from disclosure under federal law. In
these situations, the public record request will be denied on that basis. The
Ohio Revised Code requires that any denial be supported by legal authority. If
there are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting
explanation, including legal authority, unless federal or state law authorizes
or requires the redaction. The explanation for a denial of any record must be
provided in writing only if the request was received in writing.
      (2)   The Ohio Revised Code regards certain actions as being "denials" of
public record requests. These situations are handled as follows:
         A.    When a public record contains information that is not within the
definition of a "public record" as defined by law, or is exempt by law, the
Public Records Custodian will make available that portion of the public record
that does meet the definition of a "public record." The Public Records
Custodian shall make a copy of the public record, perform the redaction, then
make a copy of that sheet and make the second copy available to the requester.
The requester will not be charged for the first copy made. If practical, the
first copy will be retained by the Public Records Custodian.
         B.   Requests that are ambiguous, overly broad, or are difficult to
identify the public records requested. At times, a requester may make a public
records request from which the Public Records Custodian cannot determine which
public records are being sought. In such circumstances, the Public Records
Custodian will inform the requester that the public records request is denied,
but will give the requester an opportunity to more accurately describe the
public records sought. If the requester is seeking public records organized in
a certain way, but the public records are not organized in that way, the Public
Records Custodian will inform the requester of the manner that the public
records of the office under discussion are maintained and accessed. The
requester may then submit a public records request that more accurately
reflects the actual organization of the public records sought. (Ord. 08-11.
Passed 10-20-08.)
107.04 COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   The Public Records Custodian reserves the right to consult with legal
counsel prior to the release of any public records. This is to allow the
Village to comply with laws regarding the release of certain records.
   (b)   The Village of Delta recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences
of failure to properly respond to a public records request.

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
181.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter

   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
181.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

181.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
181.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two

         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
181.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
181.081 RELIEF AND RECIPROCITY PROVISIONS.
    It is the intent of this section that a taxpayer, subject to tax in more
than one municipality on the same income, who has complied with the provisions
hereof shall not be required by this chapter to pay a total municipal income
tax on such income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter:
   (a)    Residents of Delta.
      (1)   When a resident of Delta is subject to and has paid, or has
acknowledged liability for a municipal income tax in another Ohio municipality
on the same taxable income under this chapter and such other Ohio municipality
does not allow a credit to its nonresidents, such Delta resident may claim a
credit of the amount of such other Ohio municipality, not to exceed one percent
(1%) of the amount of such other municipality for the same tax year, but not in
excess of the tax assessed by this chapter.
      (2)    A.    When a resident of Delta is subject to and has paid or has
acknowledged liability for an Ohio municipality on the same income taxable
under this chapter and such other Ohio municipality allows a credit to its
nonresidents on the same basis as provided in subsection (b)(1) a credit shall
be allowed against Delta income tax as outlined and provided in subsection (b)
(1).
         B.    If the tax due such other municipality has been paid to or
withheld in such other municipality, a resident of Delta may claim credit for
and assign to the Village of Delta any claim for refund to which he or she may
be entitled from such other municipality. In the event an amount is not
received by the Village of Delta equal to such credit claimed by reason of tax
payments made to, or withheld in, such other municipality, then the taxpayer
shall be liable to the Village of Delta for an amount by which the claim credit
exceeds the amount recovered on such assignment by the Village of Delta,
together with penalty and interest. If satisfactory evidence is offered,
however, that the taxpayer is entitled to the claim covered by the assignment,
such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit therefor because of fault or
neglect on the part of either municipality.
         C.    Assignment of any claim for refund to which a Delta resident may
be entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment
of that portion of Delta income tax represented by such assignment; provided,
however, should an overpayment result from the credit allowed by reason of such
assignment, no refund thereof shall be made until such assignment has been
accepted for payment by such other municipality.
   (b)    Nonresidents of Delta.
      (1)    When a nonresident of Delta is subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter and is also subject to tax on the same income in the municipality of
his residence, there shall be no reciprocal credits granted with any other
municipality. All credits referred to and outlined herein shall be allowed,
provided:
      (2)   Any amount due a nonresident as a result of having overpaid the tax
due the Village of Delta, or arising from allowance of the credit provided for
herein may, under regulations adopted by the Tax Administrator, be assigned to
and paid to such other municipality.
   (c)   The credits provided for in subsection (a) and (b) will not be allowed
unless the same are claimed in a timely return or form acceptable to and filed
with the Tax Administrator. In the event a taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses
to file such timely return or form he or she shall not be entitled to such
credit and shall be liable for the full amount of tax assessed by this chapter,
together with such interest and penalties, both civil and criminal, as
prescribed in this chapter.
   (d)   Any claim for credit for income tax paid another municipality on the
same income taxable hereunder, or claim for or assignment of any refund due to
the credit provided for herein, must be filed with the Tax Administrator of the
Village of Delta on or before December 31st of the year following that for
which such credit is claimed; provided, however, in the event such claim for
reciprocity refund shall have been assigned to the municipality of residence,
such municipality of residence must file a claim for refund with the Tax
Administrator of the Village of Delta on or before January 31st next following
such December 31st. Failure to file such claim for reciprocity credit or
refund, or assignment thereof, within the times prescribed herein shall render
such credit , claim for refund, or assignment null and void.
   (e)   No credit shall be given for taxes paid to a school district on income
earned or received.
      (Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
181.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
181.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
181.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
181.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection 181.051(C) of this
Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the

income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of income or liability.

   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.

by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
181.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this

181.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall

is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual

this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
Section
181.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
181.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

181.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
181.10 of this Chapter.

liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 15-36. Passed
12-7-15.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review may be appointed to or
serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
181.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.

pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.30 RENTAL PROPERTY.
   (a)    Property Owner to File Information on New Tenants. Within thirty days
after a new tenant occupies rental property of any kind within the Village, all
property owners of rental property who rent to tenants of apartments, rooms and
other rental accommodations shall file with the Tax Tax Administrator of the
Village a report showing the names, addresses, telephone numbers, if available,
and dates the tenants initially moved in, of each tenant who occupies an
apartment, room or other rental property within the corporate limits of the
Village.
   (b)    Filing of Report When Tenants Vacate. Within thirty days after a

each tenant within the Village at their last known address. Each tenant who

after receipt, complete the questionnaire and return it to the Tax
Administrator.
   (d)    Penalty.  Violation of this section shall constitute a third degree
misdemeanor for each offense.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)
181.40 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been

or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 15-36. Passed 12-7-15.)

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC

303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail

housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section 303.991 of
the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

331.01 DRIVING UPON RIGHT SIDE OF ROADWAY; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the
right-hand lane to continue on the driver’s intended route.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.
   This subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the crossing of the
center line in making a left turn into or from an alley, private road or
driveway.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.25)
331.02 PASSING TO RIGHT WHEN PROCEEDING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
   (a)   Operators of vehicles proceeding in opposite directions shall pass
each other to the right, and upon roadways having width for not more than one
line of traffic in each direction, each operator shall give to the other one-
half of the main traveled portion of the roadway or as nearly one-half as is
reasonably possible.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.26)
331.03 OVERTAKING, PASSING TO LEFT; DRIVER'S DUTIES.
   (a)   The following rules govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles
proceeding in the same direction:
      (1)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in
the same direction shall, except as provided in subsection (a)(3) hereof,
signal to the vehicle to be overtaken, shall pass to the left thereof at a safe
distance, and shall not again drive to the right side of the roadway until
safely clear of the overtaken vehicle. When a motor vehicle overtakes and
passes a bicycle or electric bicycle, three feet or greater is considered a
safe passing distance.
      (2)   Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the
operator of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the
overtaking vehicle at the latter's audible signal, and the operator shall not
increase the speed of the operator’s vehicle until completely passed by the
overtaking vehicle.
      (3)   The operator of a vehicle overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction on a divided street or highway as defined in
Section
331.31, a limited access highway as defined in Ohio R.C. 5511.02 or a highway
with four or more traffic lanes, is not required to signal audibly to the
vehicle being overtaken and passed.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.27)
331.04 OVERTAKING AND PASSING UPON RIGHT.
   (a)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass upon the right of
another vehicle only under the following conditions:
      (1)   When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn;
      (2)   Upon a roadway with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for
two or more lines of vehicles moving lawfully in the direction being traveled
by the overtaking vehicle.
   (b)   The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle only
under conditions permitting such movement in safety. The movement shall not be
made by driving off the roadway.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.28)
331.05 OVERTAKING, PASSING TO LEFT OF CENTER.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless such
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made,
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for
traffic approaching from the opposite direction before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.29)
331.06 ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON DRIVING UPON LEFT SIDE OF ROADWAY.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be driven upon the left side of the roadway under the
following conditions:
      (1)   When approaching the crest of a grade or upon a curve in the
highway, where the operator's view is obstructed within such a distance as to
create a hazard in the event traffic might approach from the opposite
direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct or tunnel;
      (3)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection
or railroad grade crossing.
   (b)   This section does not apply to vehicles upon a one-way roadway, upon a
roadway where traffic is lawfully directed to be driven to the left side or
under the conditions described in Section
331.01(a)(2).
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.30)
331.07 HAZARDOUS OR NO PASSING ZONES.
   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in
Section
331.06.
   
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply when all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed of the
speed limit applicable to that location.
      (2)   The faster vehicle is capable of overtaking and passing the slower
vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
Section
331.05, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.31)
331.08 DRIVING IN MARKED LANES OR CONTINUOUS LINES OF TRAFFIC.
   (a)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked
lanes for traffic or wherever traffic is lawfully moving in two or more
substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules
apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all
hours, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of such signs.
      (4)   Official traffic control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway and drivers of vehicles shall obey the
directions of every such device.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate

that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described

whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this
division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would
be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.

under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending
      the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:

         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
      (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that
required the holder of the probationary driver’s license to operate a motor
vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. of this section; or the
holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
      (2)   “Family member” of a probationary license holder includes any of
the following:
         A.   A spouse;

         F.   A son or daughter of the probationary license holder’s stepparent
if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the

object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.

is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:OP
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
 545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

 545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

   (b)   None of the license fees provided for by this chapter shall be so
applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any case
where a license fee is believed by a licensee or applicant for license to place
an undue burden upon such commerce, he may apply to the Mayor for an adjustment
of the fee so that it shall not be discriminatory, unreasonable or unfair as to
such commerce. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months
after payment of the prescribed license fee. The applicant shall, by affidavit
and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross volume or
estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the Mayor may
deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden
on such commerce. The Mayor shall then conduct an investigation, comparing the
applicant’s business with other businesses of similar nature and shall make
findings of fact from which he shall determine whether the fee fixed by this
chapter is unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory as to the applicant’s
business and shall fix as the license fee for the applicant, an amount that is
fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or, if the fee has already been paid,
shall order a refund of the amount over and above the fee so fixed. In fixing
the fee to be charged, the Mayor shall have the power to base the fee upon a
percentage of gross sales, or any other method which will assure that the fee
assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so
long as the amount assessed does not exceed the fees as prescribed by
subsection (a) hereof. Should the Mayor determine the gross sales measure of
the fee to be the fair basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at
the time of termination of applicant’s business in the Village or at the end of
each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross sales and pay the
amount of fee therefor, provided that no additional fee during any one calendar
year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to
the annual license as prescribed in subsection (a) hereof.

iron, PVC, or ABS type pipe shall be made with the proper fitting. Concrete
joined connections are not allowed.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77.)
921.05 DISTURBING PAVEMENT; PERMIT REQUIRED.
   The approval of a permit to construct a sewer and to secure a tap into a
public sewer shall not be construed as the granting of authority to disturb,
cut into, open, or tunnel under a street or alley pavement or a private drive
approach. A separate application shall be made to the Council whenever the
pavement must be disturbed or tunneled in order to make a sewer.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77.)
921.06 SEPARATION OF SEWER AND WATER LINES.
   Sewer lines and water lines shall be separated horizontally by at least ten
feet and separated vertically by at least 18 inches, with the crown of the
sewer below the water line or encased to insure water tightness which is
acceptable to the Superintendent of Wastewater Facilities and other regulating
agencies.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77.)
921.07 MANHOLE OR PLUGGED CLEANOUT REQUIRED.
   In order to provide a means of cleaning sewers without digging holes and
breaking tile, it is ordained that whenever there is available a manhole into
which a sewer may be connected, the sewer shall be connected directly into the
manhole. Where no manhole is available, the property owner shall provide the
private sewer system with a six-inch plugged cleanout at the building and at
the property line. The cleanout shall be Y fittings with the top of the riser
pipes no less than six inches below ground level. A manhole will be construed
as being available whenever it is within the property line available to be
served by a sewer.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77; Ord. 1484. Passed 2-18-86.)
921.08 CONNECTION TO EITHER SANITARY OR COMBINED SEWER.
   Sanitary wastewater and commercial wastes shall be discharged into a
sanitary sewer whenever a sanitary sewer is available. If a sanitary sewer is
not available, the sanitary wastewater shall be discharged into a combined
sewer. In no event shall sanitary wastewater be discharged into a sewer which
has been designated as a stormwater sewer. In all buildings in which any drain
is too low to permit gravity flow to the proper public sewer, the wastewater,
whether sanitary or stormwater, shall be lifted by pumps or other artificial
means and discharged into the proper public sewer. Foundation drains shall be
discharged on the ground if no storm sewer is available.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77.)
921.09 EXISTING PRIVATE SEWERS.
   Existing private sewers may be used to serve a new building only when they
are found, upon examination by the Superintendent of Wastewater Facilities, to
meet all of the requirements of the ordinances of the Village.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77.)
921.10 INSPECTION REQUIRED BEFORE WORK COMPLETED.
   When the applicant is ready to have the tap constructed and connected and
before the trench is backfilled, the Superintendent of Wastewater Facilities
shall be notified to make an inspection within 24 hours. Inspection hours are

(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77.)
921.11 EXCAVATIONS, TRENCHES; WARNING LIGHTS AND BARRICADES REQUIRED.
   All excavations for the taps and the trench and sewer from the tap to the
applicant's property line shall be made by the applicant. The replacement or
repair of sewers cut off or broken during digging shall be the responsibility
of the applicant or his contractor. The applicant shall be responsible for all
excavations, trenches, and other hazards created in the construction of the
private sewers, shall be responsible to erect guard rails and barricades and
shall provide the lights necessary to warn the public of the dangers created.
(Ord. 1179. Passed 3-21-77; Ord. 1484. Passed 2-18-86.)
921.12 TESTING OF SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   Supervision.
      (1)    All sewers must be tested by the contractor under the supervision
of the Engineer prior to acceptance by the owner.
      (2)    Test for the owner's acceptance must be conducted at least 30 days
after the full backfill is placed, although the contractor is free to conduct
his own unofficial test prior to that time. The cost of testing is paid for in
the price bid for pipe.
      (3)    If the tests are not passed, the contractor shall be required to
locate and remedy the defects in construction causing the infiltration and/or
deflection; and the test shall be performed again on any section failing the
initial infiltration and/or deflection test. Sections, or the system will not
be conditionally accepted, until a satisfactory infiltration and/or deflection
result is obtained.
      (4)    It is understood that each manhole to manhole section must be
tested and determined by the Engineer to conform to requirements of the
specifications before the section is included in the month estimate at full
contract price. It is further understood that if the tests do not fall within
the limits specified, the Contractor will be required to do such work as may be
necessary to insure conformance even to the extent of reconstruction of the
defective section or sections.
      (5)    All visible leakage in sewers or manholes shall be repaired, even
though tests may have been satisfactory.
   (b)   Gravity Sewers. 
      (1)    All gravity sewers will be tested by the low pressure air
exfiltration leakage methods.
      (2)    In all subsequent references to test pressure, a pressure
adjustment shall be made where ground water is above the sewer line being
tested, by adding 0.433 psi pressure for each foot the ground water level is
above the invert of the pipe, based upon the maximum for the test section. The
contractor shall make provisions for determining the ground water level and the
level shall be confirmed by the engineer.
      (3)    Test procedures shall be as follows: The section of pipe to be
tested shall be plugged at each end. The ends of all branches, wyes, and
laterals shall be sealed or plugged. All plugs shall be braced to prevent
slippage or blowout. One of the plugs provided shall have an inlet tap or other
provision for connection of an air hose.
      (4)    Connect one end of the air hose to the inlet tap on the plug and
the other end to portable air control equipment, which shall consist of
pressure gauges and valves to control the rate at which air flows into the test
section and to monitor the air pressure within the test section. Pressure
gauges shall have minimum graduations of 0.1 psi and an accuracy of plus or
minus 0.04 psi. The air control equipment shall be connected to a source of air
supply such as an air compressor.
      (5)    Air shall be applied slowly to the test section until the pressure
reaches four psig (pounds per square inch, gauge), plus adjustment for ground
water. The pressure inside the pipe shall not exceed five psig, plus adjustment
for ground water When the pressure inside the test section reaches 4.0 psig,
the air pressure shall be throttled so that the internal pressure is maintained
between 4.0 and 3.5 psig for at least two minutes to permit temperature
stabilization.
      (6)    Upon expiration of the two minute period, the air supply shall be
shut off or disconnected and the pressure allowed to drop to exactly 3.5 psig.
At the exact time 3.5 psig is reached, a stop watch shall be started and the
time required to drop exactly 2.5 psig shall be determined.
      (7)    Make proper pressure adjustments for ground water, where
applicable, in determining the beginning and end of the period for the 1.0 psig
pressure drop. The permissible time allocation for the 1.0 psig pressure drop
shall be calculated on the basis of the diameter and length of the main sewer
tested and no adjustment shall be made for service connections included in the
test.
      (8)    The air test for the test section shall be considered acceptable
if the time elapsed for the 1.0 psig pressure drop, as previously specified, is
equal to or greater than the time, in minutes, indicated on the following
table:
Length of Main Line Tester
Pipe diameter (inches) 100   200    300    400    500    600
                       Feet  Feet   Feet   Feet   Feet   Feet

24                     13    23     34-1/2 46     57-1/2 69
 
   (c)   Time in Minutes.
      (1)    Time for intermediate lengths shall be interpolated.
      (2)    The air test shall be unacceptable if the elapsed time is less
than the stated period, defects shall be corrected and the line retested.
Unless the air test fails due to a leaking plug, a TV inspection of the test
section shall be conducted to determine the cause of the failure, this shall be
at the expense of the contractor.
      (3)    If an infiltration leakage test is used rather than an air test,
the maximum rate of infiltration is 200 gallons per inch diameter per mile of
pipe, per 24 hours. This test is to be conducted when the height of the ground
water is four feet or more above the elevation of the crown of the pipe at the
upstream and of the section of pipe to be tested. If the ground water does not
provide sufficient head, the contractor shall flood the trench to obtain
specified external head. The measuring device shall be V-notch weir or other
measuring device approved by the engineer.
      (4)    All tests for acceptance shall be conducted with the engineer
present. Safety precautions shall be carefully observed by the contractor
during air testing, recognizing the danger from plugs blowing out and from
loading the sewer line with the full pressure of the compressor. No one shall
be allowed in manholes during testing.
      (5)    All sewers must be tested for infiltration. When this cannot be
achieved in sections of sewers that are being replaced in the same trench as
the existing sewers, and upon approval of the engineer, the lines must be
televised internally to verify leakage points. Water head of at least four feet
must be applied over the sewer during this procedure. Televising shall be
limited to periods between midnight and 6:00 a.m. Leaking points must be
repaired as previously explained. This process may not be substituted in areas
where air or leakage tests are feasible.
   (d)   Deflection Test.
      (1)    If PVC or ABS pipe is used deflection tests will be run not less
than thirty days after final full backfill has been placed. The test required
on all PVC and ABS pipe deeper than twelve feet at points between two manholes
and at depths shallower than twelve feet if the pipe has a stiffness of less
than 200 psi.
      (2)    Where possible, electronic equipment shall be used to measure and
record the deflection in flexible pipe. No pipe shall exceed a deflection of
5%.
      (3)    If such equipment is not available, the deflection test can be run
by use of mandrels, having a diameter equal to 95% of the inside diameter of
the pipe pulled through the sewer line without mechanical pulling devices.
Mandrels shall be constructed with at least nine evenly spaced arms or prongs.
A metal proving ring shall be provided to verify the accuracy of the mandrel to
the Engineer. The contractor length of the mandrel shall be eight inches for
eight-inch pipe, and ten inches for ten-inch and twelve-inch pipe.
      (4)    If any section of conduit exceeds a deflection of five percent, it
shall be the Contractor's responsibility to make the necessary corrections to
the satisfaction of the engineer. The costs of all materials, equipment, labor,
and all incidentals necessary for making the deflection test and for making any
necessary corrections or replacement shall be included in the price of the
pipe. The deflection test is required to conditional and final acceptance. At
the discretion of the engineer, it may be required that the PVC and ABS sewers
be tested for deflection before expiration of the one-year maintenance bond. A
conduit, which has deflected more than 5%, must be corrected to the
satisfaction of the engineer by the contractor.
   (e)   Force Main Testing.
      (1)    A leakage test shall be applied to all force mains. The force main
shall remain isolated from adjacent force mains and a pressure of at least 100
pounds per square inch shall be applied by pumping clean water from a clean
container through one-inch corporation stops installed in the ends of the force
main, with the contractor to provide an initial pressure of 110-120 psi.
      (2)    The pressure test shall be in an afternoon and the pressure shall
be on for eighteen hours and then the pressure shall be maintained at 100 psi
or more for an additional six hours by pumping water from the container. A
minimum test pressure of 100 psi shall be assured by pumping until a pressure
110-120 psi is attained. At the end of the six-hour period the water used shall
be measured and the loss by leakage shall not exceed 75 gallons per inch
diameter per mile of pipe per 24 hours.
      (3)    If the force main does not pass the leakage test, the leaks shall
be located and repaired and the testing procedure repeated.
      (4)    The cost of furnishing all material, labor, equipment and the
total volume of water for testing is included in the price of the force main.
         (Ord. 89-15. Passed 6-19-89.)
921.13 DISCHARGE REGULATIONS.

cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters; or substances that would result in a
violation of the NPDES permit.
      (9)    Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
      (10)    Any wastes with objectionable color not removable by the
treatment process.
      (11)    All testing to identify any of the above mentioned pollutants,
waters or wastes shall be in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater".

no way be directed to flood or otherwise cause damage to adjoining property.
The owner of any building(s) situated within the Village is required at his
expense to disconnect all existing roof drains from sanitary and combined
sewers in accordance with the provisions of this section within 180 days after
the date of official notice to do so. Discharge units connecting to a Village
sanitary sewer or combination sewer shall be free of all storm water. It is
prohibited that any new construction of discharge units shall have any storm
water connections of roof drains, footer and foundation tiles or any other
connection to a sanitary sewer. The Village retains the right to prohibit new
taps to the system if said tap would cause the capacity of the system to be
exceeded.
   (b)   Allowable Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically
designated as acceptable combined sewers or storm sewers or to natural outlet
approved by the Village and other regulatory agencies.
   (c)   Wastewater Discharge. 
      (1)    It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit

thousand five hundred dollars ($4,500) shall be due and payable at the time
application is made, except for service to any properties that were subject to
a special assessment upon the initial construction of the system.
      (3)    All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection
of the building sewer from the building to the sanitary sewer shall be borne by
the owner. The owner shall indemnify the Village from any loss or damage that
may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building
sewer.
      (4)    A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building, except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
      (5)    Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to
meet all requirements of this section.
      (6)    The building sewer shall be PVC sewer pipe, ASTM specification
(D3034) or equal; or other suitable material approved by the Superintendent.
Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is
located within ten feet of a water service pipe or 25 feet of a well shall be
constructed of waterline equivalent.
      (7)    The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Superintendent.
      (8)    Whenever possible the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be
laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby
be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment in so
far as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved
pipe and fittings.
      (9)    In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
      (10)    All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench-work unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent. Pipe
laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification
(C12-19) except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been
inspected.
      (11)    All joints and connections shall be made watertight.
      (12)    The applicant for the sewer connection permit shall notify the
Superintendent at least 48 hours in advance when the building sewer is ready
for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made
under the supervision of the Superintendent or his representative.
      (13)    All excavations for building sewer installation shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the
course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Village.
         (Ord. 96-4. Passed 5-20-96.)
921.15 CONTROL AND PROHIBITED WASTES.
   (a)   Regulatory Actions. If wastewaters containing any substance described
in Section
921.14 are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the
Village or to any sewer system tributary thereto, the Superintendent or Village
Legal Advisor may take any action necessary to:
      (1)    Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
      (2)    Require a discharge to demonstrate that inplant modifications will
control, reduce, or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity
with this chapter. This may include control over the quantities and rates of
discharge.
      (3)    Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and
regulations.
      (4)    Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to
pay an additional cost or expense incurred by the Village for handling and
treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system.
      (5)    Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable
or necessary to achieve the purpose of this section.
      (6)    All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in the latest federal regulations unless
the Village is committed in its NPDES permit to remove a specified percentage
of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances the applicable pretreatment
standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels determined by the engineer,
Superintendent, or his duly authorized representative or state regulatory
agencies.
      (7)    Special conditions. No statement contained in this section shall
be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment subject to
possible payment therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment.
Any industrial concern may appeal to the Village Council any determination made
by the engineer or Superintendent in the enforcement of this section.
      (8)    After passage of this section, each person whose operation entails
the discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file
with the Village a written statement setting forth the nature of the operation
contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of water required
for use, the proposed point of discharge of said wastes into the wastewater
collection systems of the Village, subject to possible payment therefor by the
industrial concern for subsequent treatment, the estimated amount to be so
discharged and a fair statement setting forth the expected bacterial, physical,
chemical, and other known characteristics of said wastes. Within a reasonable
time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of the Village to make
an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the judgement of the engineer
or Superintendent may be necessary to adequately guard against unlawful uses of
the Village's wastewater system. Any industrial concern may appeal to the
Village Council any determination made by the engineer or Superintendent in the
enforcement of this section.
   (b)   Submission of Plans. 
      (1)    Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to
discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system is required, plans,
specifications, other pertinent data or information, including installation of
facilities and equipment relating to such pretreatment or flow control
facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent.
Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or such facilities from compliance
with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such
pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to
and prior approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)    Grease and oil interceptor. For grease, oil and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of
the engineer or Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
this chapter, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the engineer or Superintendent, and shall be located as to
be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and
shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the collected
materials not performed by the owner(s) personnel must be performed by
currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (c)   Pretreatment Facilities Operations. If pretreatment or control of
waste flows is required, such facilities shall be continuously maintained in
good working order and operated as effectively and efficiently as possible by
the owner or operator at his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements
of these rules and regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances, and
laws. All pretreatment activities shall comply with Federal Regulations 40 CFR
403.
   (d)   Admission to Property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purposes
of these rules and regulations, the Superintendent upon the presentation of
credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at reasonable times for
the purpose of copying any records required to be kept under the provisions of
this section, inspecting any monitoring equipment or method, and sampling any
discharge of wastewater to the treatment works. The Superintendent may enter
upon the property at any hour under emergency circumstances.
   (e)   Protection from Accidental Discharge. Each industrial user shall
provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes regulated by this section. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or
operator's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Superintendent for review, and shall be approved by him before construction of
the facility. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility
as necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
   (f)   Reporting of Accidental Discharge. If, for any reason, a facility does
not comply with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition or limitations
in this section, the facility responsible for such discharge shall immediately
notify the Superintendent so that corrective action may be taken to protect the
treatment system. In addition, a written report addressed to the Superintendent
detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity
and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent
future discharges, shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within
five days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge. (Ord. 96-4. Passed
5-20-96.)
921.16 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)   Discharge Reports. 
      (1)    Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge
report at such intervals as are designated by the Superintendent. The
Superintendent may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing
to discharge into the treatment system to file such periodic reports.
      (2)    The discharge report shall include, but, in the discretion of the
Superintendent, shall not be limited to, nature of process, volume, rates of
flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation,
concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to
the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they
are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the
Superintendent may require information in the form of self-monitoring reports.
   (b)   Records and Monitoring. 
      (1)    All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and any applicable state or federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (2)    Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial
user's compliance with this section shall be prepared as requested and
submitted to the Superintendent.
      (3)    The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own cost and expense
suitable control manholes or access points, and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations, and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Superintendent.
      (4)    Wastewater volume determination. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial waste surcharges shall be the metered water consumption of
the person except as herein provided in the paragraph.
         A.   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than a
metered, public water system, all or part which is discharged into the public
sewer, the person shall install and maintain at his expense water meter of a
type approved by the engineer or Superintendent for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from those other sources. Access to these meters
shall be made available to representatives of the Village at any reasonable
time. The accuracy of said meters shall be verified at the discharger’s expense
on a once per two year basis at a minimum or, at the request of the
Superintendent, by an independent testing company.
         B.   The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the
volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial
waste surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the Engineer or Superintendent.
          C.   The engineer or Superintendent may require the installation of
devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. Any
metering device for determining the volume of waste discharged to the public
sewer shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person responsible for
its discharge. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be
removed without the consent of the engineer or Superintendent.
      (5)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Superintendent may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area,
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or
sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (6)    Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Superintendent's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Inspection, Sampling and Analysis. 
      (1)    Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect
to Section
921.13 prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a 24-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time
span, as determined necessary by the Superintendent to meet the needs of
specific circumstances.
      (2)    Sampling and monitoring. 
         A.   Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the engineer or Superintendent but in no case less than
two 24-hour composite samples per month. The owner shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
         B.   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be
accomplished by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the
engineer or his authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state
comparable to that at the time the same was taken.
      (3)    Analysis of industrial wastewaters. 
         A.   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods" or the
"Method for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste" published by the U. S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Analysis of those pollutants not covered by
these publications shall be performed in accordance with procedures established
by the State Environmental Protection Agency. However, alternative methods for
certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used subject to mutual agreement
between the engineer or Superintendent and the person responsible for its
discharge. Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes shall be made by the person responsible for the discharge, or his
qualified agent as approved by the engineer or Superintendent. The results of
the analyses, shall be reported to the Village on a monthly basis on forms
provided by the Village. The Village shall make its own analyses on the wastes
and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under
circumstances in the following paragraph. Testing standards shall comply with
Federal Regulations 40 CFR 136.
         B.   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village
result in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the
industry to collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own
samples. The results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Village
and the industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as
outlined in the latest edition of "Standard Methods" and the differences
negotiated.
            (Ord. 96-4. Passed 5-20-96.)
921.17 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing for the cost of the management,
maintenance, operation and repair of the sewerage system and sewage pumping,
treatment and disposal works, and for the enlargement or replacement of the
system and works, and for the construction and re- construction of main and
interceptor sewers and the payment of interest on any debt incurred for the
construction thereof, there is hereby levied and assessed upon each lot or
parcel of land within or without the Village on which a building, commercial,
industrial, institutional or residential use is located, which is connected to
the Village sewer system to commence and be collected monthly by Village
ordinance.
   (b)   The service charge calculation for unmetered uses shall be related to
the concept of "unit equivalent" charges which shall be based on the specific
use of each specific property or building unit connected or required to be
connected to the sanitary system. For the purpose of this regulation, one
"unit" shall be equivalent to one single family dwelling and also to 250
gallons per day of sanitary flow. The "use" of a connected property or building
unit shall be determined by the Village in accordance with local zoning
requirements, building codes, and health regulations and will be subject to
occasional re-evaluation if a change in property use occurs due to remodeling,
new construction, change of ownership, or other possible usage change or at the
determination of the Village. For the purpose of defining property uses other
than single family usage, the following table of unit equivalents shall apply:
Type of Use                           Unit Equivalent

home park but used as a single-family dwelling.
      (2)    1.000 unit minimum.
      (3)    Domestic employee sanitary flows only. Process waters require
specific considerations.
   (c)   User types not included in the preceding table shall be evaluated on a
case by case basis by the Village which shall establish a unit equivalent
determination for these special cases. Also, based upon actual experience or
operation of the Village's sewerage system, the Village reserves the right to
make justified adjustments to the table of unit equivalents or the "unit" flow
contribution figure provided previously in order to assure equitable service
charges to users of the system. Any user with a unit equivalent calculated to
be less than one unit shall receive a one unit rating as a minimum unit
equivalent rating for user charge consideration. Each property having multiple
uses shall be charged a separate sewer charge for each separate use of the
property.
   (d)   The sewer service charge system will be audited annually by the
Village with the charges being adjusted upwards or downwards in order to assure
that the system is and will continue to be self sufficient and that sufficient
revenue is being generated from each user class in the proper proportions. No
free service shall be provided in this service charge system. Each user will be
notified by the Village, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill,
of the rates for that year and that portion of the service charges which are
attributable to the user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement of
the system. In addition, rates will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly to
compensate users of each class for any overages and underages accumulated
during the previous rate period.
   
   (e)   High strength waste water into the public sewers as determined by this
section shall be subject to surcharges determined monthly on the basis of the
following formula:
 
P equals (A) x B.O.D. plus (B) x S.S.
where       A =    $0.14 per lb. BOD/yr.
      B =    $0.14 per lb. SS/yr.
      P equals monthly surcharge.
BOD equals pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per month in excess of 200 mg/
l concentration in the wastewater.
S.S. equals pounds of suspended solids per month in excess of 240 mg/
l concentration.
   (f)   In the above formula A and B refer to the total expenditures per pound
of BOD and suspended solids, respectively, to collect, convey and treat the
wastewater, which shall be determined annually by the Village.
(Ord. 96-4. Passed 5-20-96.)
921.18 APPLICABILITY OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   (a)   Where a sewer is available, it will be presumed that the waste from
the premises either will be discharged directly or indirectly into the sewerage
system and the property will be subject to the current sewer service charges.
   (b)   Where premises are not served directly or indirectly by the sewerage
system and should be exempt from the sewer service charge, it will be the
responsibility of the property owner or other interested party to notify the
Village of said claim for exemption. All lots, lands, buildings or premises
owned by Delta, Ohio within the Village shall be subject to the sewer service
charge as set forth herein.

if it were permitted to remain, would endanger the life, limb, or property of
persons or property upon the public streets or public ways adjacent thereto by
reason of the collapse of such building or structure or by the falling of
objects therefrom; or
   (b)    Any tree, stack or other object standing upon property is in such

dilapidated that, due to lack of adequate maintenance or neglect, it becomes

occupants, or causes such a condition of blight that it materially interferes
with the peaceful enjoyment and lawful use of owners or occupants of a
proximate property; or

injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others; or
   (j)   There is an accumulation of any dirt, filth, rubbish, garbage, waste,
leaves or clippings, boxes, or any other matter of an unsightly or unsanitary
nature, in such a manner that such matter could become dangerous to the public
health, comfort and safety of others, that such matter could be blown into any
street, alley, park, public ground, sidewalk, or property of another, or such
matter could be deposited into any plumbing fixture that it may obstruct or
render unwholesome any sanitary sewer or watercourse; or
   (k)    Any swimming pool, pond or similar structure remains unfenced by a

areas to be supplied with gates suitable to locking, when failure to fence
endangers the public health, welfare or safety of the citizens of the Village
of Delta; or

property, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience, discomfort, depreciation,
damage, or injury to any one or more persons or to any other property in the
Village; or

abatement, the Village Administrator or a designee shall cause photographs of
such nuisance to be made and filed with the reports of the aforementioned

property.

aforesaid notice to be left with the individual, if any, in possession of the
premises on which the public nuisance exists, or if there is no individual in
possession of the premises, a copy of the notice shall be posted on the
premises. If the abatement required to correct the nuisance involves demolition
of any structure, then a copy of such notice, in addition to posting notice on
the premises, shall also be served personally or by U.S. Mail, with delivery

interest of record in the property.

1125.05  HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (a)   Statement of Purpose. It is the intent of this section to eliminate as
home occupations all uses except those that conform to the standards set forth
in this section. The standards for home occupations in this section are
intended to insure compatibility with other permitted uses and with the
residential character of the neighborhood, plus a clearly secondary or
incidental statue in relation to the residential use of the main building as
the criteria for determining whether a proposed accessory use qualifies as a
home occupation.
   (b)   Definitions. A home occupation is an accessory use of a dwelling unit,
conducted entirely within the dwelling unit, carried on by one or more persons,
all of whom reside within the dwelling unit, and where no persons are employed
other than the resident and domestic help. The use is clearly incidental and
secondary to the use of the dwelling for residence purposes and does not change
the character thereof or adversely affect the uses permitted in the residential
district of which it is a part. There shall be no outside storage of any kind;
and any indoor storage, construction, alteration, or electrical or mechanical
equipment used shall not change the fire rating of the structure or the fire
district in which the structure is located. The use may increase vehicular
traffic flow and parking by no more than one additional vehicle at a time. It
shall not cause an increase in the use of one or more utilities (water, sewer,
electricity, telephone, or garbage) so that the combined total use for dwelling
and home occupation purposes of the one or more utilities exceeds the average
for residences in the neighborhood. When a use is a home occupation, it means
the owner, lessee, or other persons who have a legal right to use the dwelling
unit also have the vested right to conduct the home occupation without securing
special permission to do so. However, such person shall be subject to all
conditions which are applied in this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Necessary Conditions. Home occupations are permitted accessory uses in
residential zones only as long as all the following conditions are observed:
      (1)   Such occupation shall be conducted solely by resident occupants in
their residence.
      (2)   No more than one room or twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross
area of one floor of said residence, whichever is less, shall be used for such
purpose. Use of accessory buildings for these purposes is prohibited.
      (3)   No use shall require internal or external alterations or involve
construction features or the use of electrical or mechanical equipment that
would change the fire rating of the structure or the fire district in which the
structure is located.
      (4)   No home occupation shall cause an increase in the use of any one or
more utilities (water, sewer, electricity, telephone, garbage, etc.) so that
the combined total use for dwelling and home occupation proposed exceeds the
average for residences in the neighborhood.
      (5)   There shall be no outside storage of any kind related to no more
than one additional vehicle at a time.
      (6)   The use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more
than one additional vehicle at a time.
      (7)   No use shall create noise, dust, vibration, smoke, glare,
electrical interference, fire hazard, or any other hazard or nuisance to any
greater or more frequent extent than that usually experienced in an average
residential occupancy in the district in question under normal circumstances
wherein no home occupation exists.
   (d)   Nameplate Allowed. Only one nameplate shall be allowed. It may display
the names of the occupant and/or the name of the home occupation (e.g. John
Jones, Realtor). It shall not exceed four (4) square feet in area, shall be
non-illuminated, and attached flat to the main structure or visible through a
window. The limitation of one nameplate is intended to apply to all lots,
including corner lots. No signs are permitted in the yard area.
   (e)   Permitted Home Occupations. Home occupations include, but are not
necessarily limited to, the following:
      (1)   Artists and sculptors;
      (2)   Authors and composers;
      (3)   Dressmakers, seamstresses, and tailors;

appropriateness before a permit is issued.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may establish other requirements as
necessary under each individual proposed use.
      (3)   A change in said ownership shall nullify the-Home Occupation
Permit.
      (4)   If the home occupation is not listed as a permitted use in this
section, the Planning Commission shall determine if such use would be permitted
as a home occupation. (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1125.06  MANUFACTURED HOME PARK DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the "MH", Manufactured Home Park District, is
to encourage a suitable environment for persons and families that by preference
choose to live in manufactured homes rather than a conventional site built
single-family structure. In keeping with the occupancy characteristics of
contemporary manufactured homes, this section establishes low density standards
and permitted uses that reflect the needs of residents in the district.
Development is limited to manufactured homes when located in a manufactured
home park on rental lots. No trailer, camper, or similar portable residence
structures shall be permitted to locate in the Village for occupancy purposes.
Mobile homes are allowed only in established Mobile Home Parks.
   (b)   Principal Permitted Uses. The following provisions apply to all "MH",
Manufactured Home Park Districts. Any use not expressly permitted is

nearest edge of the road right-of-way to the line of the closest manufactured
home site.
      (3)   Recreation. A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the total park should
be left in open space developed for recreation purposes. Such developed area
shall not include roads, sidewalks or lands under water or having excessive
grades and shall be so graded and developed as to have adequate drainage and
usability by residents of the park.
      (4)   Site dimensions. Each single section manufactured home shall have
its own home site which shall be at least forty feet (40') wide and ninety feet
(90') in depth, a minimum of three thousand six hundred (3,600) square feet in
area.
      (5)   Site placement. Manufactured homes shall be at least twenty feet
(20') from the rear and side of the nearest manufactured home and fifteen feet
(15') from the end and side of the nearest manufactured home, and shall be
placed at least ten feet (10') from the pavement of the access drive.
      (6)   Access. All manufactured home parks shall have access to a paved
major thoroughfare. The proposed site shall have at least one property line
abutting a major thoroughfare, a thoroughfare of at least sixty feet (60') of
right-of-way existing or proposed. All ingress and egress to the site shall be
directly from a major thoroughfare.
      (7)   Vehicle travel lanes. All roadways and driveways shall be hard
surfaced and so constructed as to handle all anticipated peak loads, adequately
drained and lighted for safety and ease of movement of vehicles. The local
roadway system shall be so designated as to prevent the use of such roadways
for through traffic. The width of all travel lanes shall be no less than twenty
feet (20').
      (8)   Storm drainage facilities. Shall be so constructed as to protect
those that will reside in the manufactured home park, as well as the property
owners adjacent to the park. Such park facilities shall be of such capacity to
insure rapid drainage and prevent the accumulation of stagnant pools of water
in or adjacent to the park.
      (9)   Fuel oil and gas storage. Shall be centrally located in underground
tanks, at a distance away from any manufactured home lot found to be safe. All
fuel lines leading to manufactured home lots shall be underground and so
designed as to conform with the State Code that is found to be applicable.
   (d)   Site Plan Review. A site plan must be submitted to the Planning
Commission showing all buildings, parking areas, manufactured home sites, and
landscaping at a scale sufficient to permit study of all elements of the plan.
Typical elevations and floor plans of any buildings must also be provided. In
addition, the proposed site plan of the development shall show all adjacent
properties, including existing buildings, located within two-hundred feet
(200') of the proposed site in the same block. The plans shall meet the
required standards and design and indicate no adverse effects which cause
injury to adjoining property of the Village as a whole. Plans so approved shall
regulate the development of said premises, unless modified in the same manner
as the plans were originally approved. Such review is necessary to secure
proper relationships between parking areas, access drives, abutting public
thoroughfares, landscaping, building, siting and open space. (Ord. 99-2. Passed
3-1-99.)

conditionally permitted use. Signs so permitted shall not be located nearer to
the front lot line than one-half the required front yard setback nor nearer the
side lot line than the required side yard setback.
      (6)   In a Multiple-Family Residential District, one ground or wall sign
indicating the name of the multiple housing development which shall be in
addition to individual dwelling name plates. Such signs shall not exceed
thirty-five (35) square feet in area.

the Ohio Basic Building Code relating to design, structural members and
connections. Signs shall also comply with the provisions of the applicable
Electrical Code and any other additional construction standards hereinafter set
forth.
      (2)   No temporary or permanent signage shall be permitted to be placed
off- premises.
      (3)   In the case of a corner lot situated on two or more streets, signs
may be permitted on each street.
      (4)   Only one ground or pole sign shall be permitted on any lot, except
that a shopping center shall be permitted one ground pole sign for each major
thoroughfare frontage, provided, however, there shall be allowed one business
or identification sign not exceeding one foot by four feet and attached to the
pole sign for each business within the shopping center.
      (5)   Each business occupancy, other than the ground floor, shall be
entitled to one additional business or identification sign of the wall or flat
type or incorporated within a permitted projecting sign.
   (j)   Permitted Signs and Restrictions by Structural Type.  
      (1)   Wall signs.
         A.   Wall signs which are mounted on the principal frontage of a
building may be only on-premises signs.
         B.   The maximum projection from the building facade of any wall sign
which is set less than ten feet (10') above the adjacent sidewalk or street
grade is nine inches. Wall signs mounted with a minimum clearance of ten feet
above the adjacent sidewalk, or fourteen feet (14') above a driveway on which
it projects, may project up to twelve inches (12') from the facade on which it
is mounted. The minimum distance of wall mounted signs from an adjacent store
front is two feet (2').
         C.   No part of any wall sign shall extend beyond the roof line of the
building on which it is erected or painted.
         D.   The maximum sign area in square feet for a wall sign may be
calculated by multiplying the linear foot frontage of the principal facade of
the building by 1.5 square feet. If the building has a secondary frontage, a
second sign of equal area may be placed thereon.
      (2)   Canopy signs, above canopy signs, pendant signs.  
         A.   Canopy signs which are mounted on top of canopy structures
attached to the building may be only on-premises signs, whether on the
principal or secondary frontage.
         B.   The canopy to which the sign is attached may not project closer
than one foot to the curb line of the adjacent sidewalk or walkway. If the
canopy projects over a driveway or other area used by vehicles, the minimum
vertical clearance of the lowest portion of the canopy shall be fourteen feet
(14'). The minimum vertical clearance of the lowest portion of the canopy above
the sidewalk grade is ten feet (10'). No part of any above canopy mounted sign
shall project forward of the canopy's front horizontal support.
         C.   No above canopy mounted sign shall extend above the roof line of
the building to which it attached.
         D.   The maximum sign area in square feet for any canopy sign may be
calculated by multiplying the linear foot frontage of the principal facade of
the building by 1.5 square feet. If the building has a secondary frontage, a
second sign of equal area may be placed thereon.
         E.   Pendant signs or those which hang below canopies shall be mounted
so as to remain rigid in their position. Pendant signs shall be mounted only
within the confines of the frontage of the building they advertise. There shall
be a minimum vertical clearance of nine feet (9') measured from the lowest
portion of the sign to the sidewalk grade immediately below where the sign is
attached.
      (3)   Projecting signs.
         A.   Projecting signs may be constructed only on the premises
advertised or where the goods and services they advertise are available. Only
one projecting sign may be erected on each building facade which faces a public
right-of-way.
         B.   The minimum clearance above the sidewalk of the lowest horizontal
surface or point on the sign, including structural trim shall be ten feet
(10'). If the projecting sign overhangs a driveway or other area used by
vehicles, the minimum clearance above grade shall be fourteen feet (14').
         C.   No projecting sign shall extend from the facade or corner of a
building to the extent that its farthest extension is closer than two (2)
linear feet from any point along the curb line. The maximum projection
permitted is limited to one inch (1") for each linear foot of building
frontage, but in no case more than six feet (6'). No part of any projecting
sign may extend above the roof line of the structure to which it is attached.
      (4)   Marquee signs.  
         A.   Marquee signs are a form of projection signs, with special
regulations as set forth in this subsection.
         B.   Marquee signs shall be subject to the requirements applicable to
projecting signs, except that marquees, regardless of the frontage of the
principal structure on which they are erected, may project from the building
facade up to, but no closer than two (2) linear feet from any point along the
curb line of the adjacent sidewalk.
         C.   The maximum length of a marquee's longest dimension parallel to
the building frontage shall be calculated by multiplying the linear length of
the building frontage by one-half.
         D.   The maximum sign area permitted for the front and side areas of a
marquee shall be determined by multiplying five (5) square feet by the linear
distance around the perimeter of the base formed by the marquee's three exposed
sides.
      (5)   Ground signs.
         A.   Ground signs shall be permitted only on-premises, that is, on the
premises they advertise or on the premises of their owner.
         B.   Where the premises have frontage on more than one public right-
of- way, one ground sign shall be permitted for each street frontage.
         C.   Ground signs shall not exceed five feet in height. Ground signs
shall have a linear width not greater than the sum of the linear frontage on
which the sign is to be placed multiplied by 1.5.
         D.   The setback for ground signs shall be a minimum of ten feet (10')
from the existing right-of-way line for streets. No part of any ground signs
shall be located closer than five feet (5') to any point at which any private
road or driveway intersects a public right-of- way.
         E.   The groundscape around the base of ground signs shall be kept
clean of noxious weeds and litter by the owner of the property on which the
sign is located.
      (6)   Free-standing signs.
         A.   Free-standing signs may be on-premises, placed in zones where
they are otherwise permissible.
         B.   One on-premises sign may be erected along each right-of-way on
which the premises have street frontage.
         C.   If the erection of free-standing signs is permitted in a zoning
district, the minimum spacing interval required between each free- standing
sign, or any part thereof, facing in the same direction on the same right-of-
way is one hundred fifty feet (150'). A minimum spacing of one hundred feet
(100') shall be required between free- standing signs on the same right-of-way
facing in opposite directions.
         D.   No free-standing sign or any part thereof may encroach on the
public right-of-way.
         E.   The setback for a free-standing sign shall be a minimum of ten
feet (10') from the existing right-of-way line. No part of any freestanding
sign shall be located closer than ten feet (10') to any point at which any
private road or driveway intersects the public right-of-way.
      (7)   Pole sign.
         A.   Pole signs are a form of free-standing mounted on one or more
poles with the base of the sign structural trim a minimum of ten feet (10')
above the adjacent sidewalk or street grade. Signs of a similar structural type
which are elevated below the minimum clearance, and not otherwise classified as
billboards, shall be regulated as ground signs.
         B.   The maximum height for pole signs is determined by the district
regulation, and its maximum length on any horizontal or vertical side is twenty
feet (20').
         C.   The maximum sign area for the face of a pole sign shall be
related to the right-of-way frontage on which it is placed. The maximum sign
area shall be determined by multiplying the linear front footage on which the
sign is placed by one and one-half (1.5) square feet, but in no case may the
sign area of a pole sign exceed two hundred fifty (250) square feet. Single or
double facing may be placed on pole signs up to the maximum sign area permitted
on the premises for each face of the sign. If the pole sign is a multi-prism
sign having more than two sides, the total sign area shall be distributed over
the multiple sign faces.
      (8)   Roof signs.
         A.   Roof signs which are fabricated and attached as independent
accessory structures to the roof, and which protrude perpendicular from the
surface of the roof more than twelve inches (12") and interfere with aerial and
roof fire-fighting efforts of the Fire Department are hereby prohibited as a
public nuisance.
         B.   Permitted roof signs, whether painted or attached as independent
accessory structures consistent with the constraints of subsection (j)(8)A.
hereof, shall be permitted to a maximum sign area of 1.5 square feet for each
linear foot measured along the base of the roof on which the sign faces. (Ord.
99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1129.02 TEMPORARY BUILDINGS.
   Temporary buildings and construction trailers used in conjunction with
construction work only may be permitted in any district during the period
construction work is in progress, but such temporary buildings shall be removed
upon completion of the construction work or upon six months. (Ord. 99-2. Passed
3-1-99.)
1129.03 OPEN STORAGE AND DISPLAY OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT.
   (a)   The open storage and display of material and equipment incident to
permitted or conditional uses in "B", "M", or"RC" Districts shall be permitted,
provided the area used for open storage and display shall be effectively
screened from all adjoining properties in any "SR" or "R" District by means of
walls, fences or plantings. Walls or fences shall be a minimum of five feet
(5') in height without advertising thereon. In lieu of such wall or fence a
strip of land not less than ten feet (10') in width and planted and maintained
with an evergreen hedge or dense planting of evergreen shrubs not less than
five feet (5') in height at the time of planting may be substituted.
   (b)   The temporary open storage of contractor's equipment and material
shall be permitted on the site upon which buildings or structures are being

      (4)   Upon completion of extraction operations the area shall either be
left as a permanent spring-fed lake or the floor thereof shall be leveled in
such manner as to prevent the collection and stagnation of water and to provide
drainage without excessive soil erosion.
      (5)   All equipment, buildings and structures for which no future use is
contemplated and which no other acceptable use is practicable or feasible,
shall be removed within three months of the completion of extraction
operations. (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
CHAPTER 1133
Planned Unit Development
1133.01   Planned Unit Development (PUD).
 
 
1133.01 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to
provide a means of development that is flexible and innovative when development
of a site by standard, more rigid, conventional zoning district regulations may
produce less efficient use of the land and less amenities and benefits for the
community and users of the development. Development under planned unit
development provisions provides a means of encouraging ingenuity, imagination
and flexibility on the part of land owner, engineers, architects, site planners
and developers in the planning and design of land areas. It is not the intent
of the planned unit development provisions to allow applicants to circumvent
the intent of this Zoning Code or to allow development of land not in
conformance with the Land Use Plan.
   (b)   Description. The Planned Unit Development may be residential,
commercial, or industrial developments or a combination commercial/industrial
uses. Each district shall have at a minimum the following net acreage:
residential - 2 acres, commercial - 5 acres, industrial - 25 acres, and a
combination commercial/industrial - 30 acres. The Planning Commission shall
review and find that the combination of uses meets the standards set forth in
Section
1113.01.
   (c)   Zoning Applications Procedure. The Planned Unit Development shall be
submitted to the Administrator and processed pursuant to subsection (c) hereof.

         E.   Gross lot acreage, net lot acreage, maximum allowable density,
proposed density with calculations indicated;
         F.   Maximum site coverage (not required for detached single-family
PUD's)
         G.   Topography at two foot contour intervals;
         H.   Existing features of the development site, including major wooded
areas, streets, easements, utility lines, and land uses;
         I.   Street layout and names;
         J.   Existing buildings to remain or to be removed, and if the
existing buildings remain, indicate proposed use;
         K.   All proposed signs excluding street signs;

   (d)   Additional Information. The Planning Commission, or Administrator may
require additional information such as professionally prepared maps, studies or
reports including environmental assessments and/or traffic impact studies for
the development. The expense for this information is the responsibility of the
applicant.
   (e)   Public Hearing Process. Upon the submittal of a complete application
and plans as determined by the Planning Commission for a Planned Unit
Development, a public hearing shall be called and a thirty day notice shall be
given. All adjoining property owners shall be notified by mail as to the public
hearing date.
   Upon the approval of the PUD by the Planning Commission, the recommendation
of the Planning Commission shall be forwarded to the Council and may at its
discretion, conduct a public hearing. If approved, the PUD designation shall be
officially placed on the zoning map.
   (f)   Standards.

1137.01  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Any lawful uses of buildings or land existing at the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance may be continued, even though such use does not conform
to the provisions hereof. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended
throughout those existing parts of the building which were arranged or designed
for such use. No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved, extended,
enlarged or altered and no nonconforming use of land shall be expanded, except
when authorized by the Board in accordance with the provisions in Chapter
1145.
   (b)   Whenever the use of a building or land becomes nonconforming through a
change in the amended Zoning Ordinance or in the district boundaries, such use
may be continued.
   (c)    A nonconforming use which is discontinued for a period of one year
shall not again be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located. A nonconforming use may be granted a one-year
extension by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

of the municipality for assistance in the performance of its duties, and it
shall be the duty of such departments to render such assistance to the Board as
may reasonably be required.
   (g)   Duties and General Powers. The Board of Appeals shall adopt rules and
regulations not inconsistent with the Zoning Ordinance, as may be necessary to
carry into effect the duties, powers and responsibilities conferred herein. The
powers, duties, and responsibilities of the Board shall be:

specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Inspector shall forthwith transmit
to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
      (2)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Zoning Inspector shall certify to the Board of Zoning
Appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with it that by reason
of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by a court of equity; after notice to the officer from who the appeal is
taken and on due cause shown.
      (3)   The Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,

from who the appeal is taken. (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.03 HEARINGS.
   (a)   The Board shall, within ten days of the filing of an appeal, fix a

property owners as it decides may be substantially interested in said
application or appeal. In the case of an adjourned hearing, persons previously

authorized by the Board.

order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make
such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to

Inspector from who the appeal is taken. Any party adversely affected by a
decision of the Board may appeal to Council on the ground that the decision was
unreasonable. (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.05  REASONS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (a)   Where the literal application of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship peculiar to the property
involved. The fact that the condition has been created or contributed to by the
owner or a prior owner.
   (b)   Where other exceptional circumstances or geographical or geological
conditions, or type of adjoining development, are only applicable to property
involved or to the intended use of the property and do not apply to other
property within the same zone unless the same exceptional circumstances
prevail.
   (c)   Where granting of a variance will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements to the neighborhood
in which the property is located.
   (d)   That the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the general
purposes, intent and objectives of this Zoning Ordinance. When applying for a
variance or modification, the applicant shall substantiate and state his claim
that each of the four conditions as they apply to each specific case are a
prerequisite for the granting of a variance or modifications.
   (e)   In granting a variance, the Board may stipulate the manner in which
the variance or exception shall be carried out, or may require other
improvements and safeguards for the protection of the health, safety and
welfare of owners and occupants of surrounding lots or the public. (Ord. 99-2.
Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.06  LAPSE OF VARIANCES.
   A variance once granted shall not be withdrawn or changed unless so approved
by the Board of Appeals. Further, if after the expiration of six months, no
substantial construction is done in accordance with the terms and conditions
for which such variance was granted, the Zoning Inspector shall give notice, in
writing, to the person who secured the variance or his successor, and thirty
days thereafter, the variance will be deemed null and void and all regulations
governing said premises in question shall revert to those in effect before the
variance was granted.
(Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.07 REQUEST OF BOARD OF APPEALS TO COUNCIL.
   If the Board of Appeals determines that there is merit in the appeal of the
applicant but that such appeal cannot be granted because all of the conditions
provided herein are not fulfilled or cannot be complied with, the Board of
Appeals may refer such matter to Council for its guidance and authorization of
the issue. Council may, but shall not be required to, consider such request by
the Board of Appeals. (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.08  CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Conditional Use Permits. Conditional Use Permits shall be required for
certain types of main uses as defined in Chapter
1113 and other sections of this Zoning Ordinance, generally publicly operated
or a facility which affects the public interest. Such use may be permitted and
desirable in certain districts but not without consideration in each case of
the effect of the use upon neighboring land and the public need for a
particular use at the particular location. The application of the planning
standards for determining the location and extent of such use is a planning
function and not in the nature of a variance or appeal.
   Enumerated throughout this Zoning Ordinance are certain uses and the
district in which conditional uses may be permitted provided the following
standards are fulfilled and a Conditional Use Permit is granted by the Board of
Appeals.
   (b)   Contents of a Conditional Use Permit.  
      (1)   An application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the
chairman of the Board of Appeals by a least one owner or lessee of property for
which each conditional use is proposed. At a minimum, the application shall
contain the following information:
         A.   Name, address and telephone number of applicant;
         B.   Legal description of existing use;
         C.   Description of existing use;
         D.   Present zoning district;
         E.   Description of proposed conditional use;
         F.   A site plan must be submitted to the Board of Appeals showing all
buildings, parking and loading areas, traffic access and circulation,
utilities, signs, and landscaping at a scale sufficient to permit study of all
elements of the plan. Typical elevations and floor plans of the building must
be provided. In addition the proposed site and planned development shall show
all adjoining properties, including existing buildings located within two
hundred feet (200') of the proposed site in the same block. The plans shall
meet the required standards or the Municipality as a whole. Such review is
necessary to secure proper relationships between parking areas, access drives,
abutting public thoroughfares, landscaping, building, siting and open space.
The Board of Appeals may require other information to determine if the proposed
conditional use meets the intent and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance;
         G.   A narrative statement evaluating the economic effects of
adjoining property; the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes
and vibration on adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility
with adjacent and other properties in the district; and the relationship of the
proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   In addition to the specific requirements listed for each
conditional use in each zoning district, the Board of Appeals shall review the
particular facts and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the
following standards and shall find adequate evidence showing that such at the
proposed location:
         A.   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives, or with any specific objective of the Municipality's Comprehensive
Plan and/or Zoning Ordinance.
         B.   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to
be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area.
         C.   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses.
         D.   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately such services.
         E.   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community.
         F.   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons,
property or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic,
noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors.
         G.   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets or roads.
         H.   Will not result in the destruction, loss or damage of a natural,
scenic or historic feature of major importance.
      (3)   The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing within twenty days
from the receipt of the application for a conditional use permit.
      (4)   Before holding the public hearing, notice of such hearing shall be
given in one or more newspapers of general circulation of the Municipality at
least ten days before the date of the hearing. The notice shall set forth the
time and place of the public hearing, and the nature of the proposed
conditional use.
      (5)   Before holding the public hearing, written notice of such hearing
shall be mailed by the chairman of the Board of Appeals, by first class mail,
at least ten days before the day of the hearing of all parties in interest and
specifically to all adjacent property owners.
      (6)   Within thirty days after the public hearing, the Board of Appeals
shall either approve, approve with supplementary conditions as specified, or
disapprove the application as presented. If the application is approved or
approved with modifications, the Board of Appeals shall direct the Zoning
Inspector to issue a conditional use permit listing the specific conditions
specified by the Board for approval. If the application is disapproved by the
Board of Appeals the applicant may seek relief through the Court of Common
Pleas.
      (7)   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one
particular conditional use and the permit shall automatically expire if, for
any reason, the conditional use ceases for more than six months.
         (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.09  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The Board shall have the power to authorize issuance of a zoning
certificate for uses that are subject to performance requirements as set forth
in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   The application for a zoning certificate for a use subject to
performance requirements shall be accompanied by a plan of the proposed
construction or development; a description of the proposed machinery, processes
and products; and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used
in meeting the Performance Requirements.
   (c)   The Board may refer the application to one or more expert consultants
qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to the
performance requirements. The costs of such services shall be borne by the
application, and a copy of any reports shall be furnished to the applicant.
(Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)
1145.10  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board,
after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing, shall
interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Ordinance. In case of any questions as to the location of any boundary
line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the Zoning
District Map may be made to the Board and a determination shall be made by said
Board. (Ord. 99-2. Passed 3-1-99.)

(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.02 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   (a)   The Subdivision Regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority
granted to the Village of Delta by Chapter 711 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   The purpose of these Regulations is to guide and regulate the
planning, subdividing and development of land in order to promote and protect
the public health, safety, and general welfare. It is intended that the
provisions of these regulations shall be applied to achieve the following
objectives:
      (1)   Orderly development of land to obtain harmonious and stable
neighborhoods.
      (2)   Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
      (3)   Designs to allow ample public open spaces for schools, traffic,
utilities, access for fire fighting equipment, adequate light and air,

      (4)   Accurate surveying of land, and preparation and recording of plats.
      (5)   The assurance that subdivision improvements are properly installed
and completed in compliance with the regulations herein.
      (6)   Insure the adequate provision of water, drainage, sanitary sewer
facilities, and other health requirements.
      (7)   Orderly development of land in accordance with zoning and Future
Land Use Plans. (Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.03 JURISDICTION.
   These Regulations shall be applicable to all subdivisions of land
hereinafter made within the corporate limits of the Village of Delta.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.04 ADMINISTRATION.
   These regulations shall be administered by the Village of Delta Planning

(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.05 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT AND SEPARABILITY.
   (a)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these
Regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements. More stringent
provisions may be required if it is demonstrated that different standards are
necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   These regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul or in
any manner interfere with any existing laws, covenants or rules provided.
However, where the conditions imposed by any provisions of these Regulations
are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions
imposed by any other provisions of these Regulations or of any other applicable
law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations
which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall
govern.
   (c)   The provisions of these Regulations are separable. If a section,
sentence, clause, phrase or other part of these Regulations is adjudged by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the decision shall not affect
the remaining portions of these Regulations.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)

collector thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the

Thoroughfares not contained in the aforementioned plan shall conform to the
recommendations of the Delta Planning Commission based upon the design
standards set forth within these Regulations and upon accepted engineering
standards.

it conforms with the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall follow the land use recommendations of
the Future Land Use Plan of the Village of Delta.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.07 MODIFICATION AND VARIANCE OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape,
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements of these Regulations would result in real
difficulties, substantial hardship, or injustice, such requirements may be
varied or modified so that the subdivider may subdivide his property in a
reasonable manner; but, at the same time, the public welfare and interest of
the Municipality and the surrounding area are thoroughly protected and the
general intent and spirit of these Regulations are enforced.
   (b)   The requirements of these Regulations may also be modified and varied
whenever the scope of a plat encompasses a complete neighborhood or community,
but any such plat shall conform to the Future Land Use Plan of the
Municipality. All land uses indicated in the Future Land Use Plan shall be
incorporated on the plat and must conform, in general, to the areas of land
usage as delineated and adopted by the Planning Commission and the Village
Council. The Future Land Use Plan and any adopted Major Thoroughfare Plan shall
be the guide for all future development of redevelopment in the Municipality.
Any such variance requested must insure that adequate public spaces,
circulation, recreation, light and air will be provided and the needs of the
entire community when fully developed and occupied will be met.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.08 AMENDMENTS.

after public hearing, amend, supplement or change these Regulations upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission. Notice shall be given on the time
and place of such public hearing by publication in at least one (1) newspaper
of general circulation published in the local area, thirty (30) days prior to
holding said hearing. The amendment or amendments shall be available in the
office of the Village Clerk for public examination during said thirty (30)
days.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1161.09 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   These Regulations shall be effective following adoption by the Village
Council and the Planning Commission and certification to the Fulton County
Recorder. Henceforth, any other regulations for the subdivision of land
previously adopted by the Village Council and the Planning Commission shall be
deemed to be repealed. These Regulations shall in no way affect any
subdivisions having received preliminary approval by the Commission prior to
the effective date; provided however, that no changes to the preliminary plan
as approved are introduced by the subdivider. (Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)

1169.01 PURPOSE.   
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedure for Planning
Commission review and action on applications for subdivisions as defined by
Ohio Revised Code 711.001 and elsewhere. The procedure is intended to provide
orderly and expeditious processing of such applications. (Ord. 95-35. Passed
11-20-95.)
1169.02 PREAPPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing subdivision and site
plan design and development costs, the subdivider is encouraged to meet with
the Planning Commission's designated representative(s) prior to submitting a
Preliminary Plat. This preapplication conference is an opportunity for the
subdivider, the Planning Commission representative(s) and other Village
officials to informally discuss the purpose and effect of these regulations,
the criteria and standards contained therein; and to familiarize the developer
with the Future Land Use Plan, the zoning resolution and the drainage,
sewerage, and water systems for the Village.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1169.03 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   (a)   In addition or as an alternative to the preapplication conference, at
the request of the applicant, the Planning Commission shall grant an informal
review of a General Development Plan, or a concept plan, for a development for
which the applicant intends to prepare and submit an application for
development. The purpose of the concept plan is to provide Planning Commission
input in the formative stages of subdivision and site plan design.
   (b)   Applicants seeking informal review of a General Development Plan shall
submit a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision containing the items specified
in Section
1169.13.
   (c)   The applicant shall not be bound by any concept plan for which review
is requested, nor shall the Planning Commission be bound by any such review.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1169.04 SUBMISSION TO STATE HIGHWAY DIRECTOR.
   Before any plat is approved affecting any land within three hundred (300)
feet of the centerline of a proposed new highway or a highway for which changes
are proposed as described in the certification to local officials by the State
Highway Director of any land within a radius of five hundred (500) feet from
the point of intersection of said centerline with any public road or highway,
the Commission shall give notice, by registered or certified mail to the
Highway Director. The Commission shall not approve the plat for one hundred and
twenty (120) days from the date the notice is received by the Highway Director.
If the Highway Director notifies the Commission that he shall proceed to
acquire the land needed, then the Commission shall refuse to approve the plat.
If the Highway Director notifies the Commission that acquisition at this time
is not in the public interest or upon the expiration of the one-hundred-and-
twenty (120) day period or any extension thereof agreed upon by the Highway
Director and the property owner, the Commission shall, if the plat is in
conformance with all provisions of these Regulations, approve the plat. (Ord.
95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)

(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1173.02 ADMINISTRATIVE WAIVER OF PLAT.

has been completely subdivided.
      (3)   The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable subdivision
or zoning regulations.

building sites.
   (b)   The Planning Commission or their designee shall, within seven (7)
working days after submission, notify the subdivider of the administrative
waiver of plat decision and of the next scheduled Planning Commission meeting,
at which time the application shall be reviewed by the Commission for
compliance with all applicable subdivision and zoning regulations.

thirty (30) days of the denial, file an appeal with the Planning Commission.
Within thirty (30) days of the appeal filing, the Planning Commission shall
review the action and affirm or reverse the administrative action. Waiver of
plat shall be given only if all applicable subdivision, zoning, drainage and
health requirements have been met.

1177.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for subdivision layout
and improvements design that will create functional and attractive
developments, minimize adverse impacts, and insure that proposed subdivisions
will be an asset to the Village. To promote this purpose, the subdivision shall
conform to the following standards, which are designed to result in a well-
planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.02 SITE DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Design of the development shall take into consideration all existing
local and regional plans for the Municipality and the surrounding community.
   (b)   To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be located to
preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental
sensitivity, to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features,
and to preserve historically significant structures and sites.
   (c)   Development shall be designed to avoid construction on steep slopes in
excess of twenty (20) percent as measured over a ten (10) foot interval unless
appropriate engineering measures concerning slope stability, erosion, and
resident safety are taken.
   (d)   The development shall be laid out to avoid adversely affecting ground
water and aquifer recharge; to reduce cut and fill; to avoid necessary
impervious cover; to prevent flooding; to provide adequate access to lots and
sites; and to mitigate adverse effects for shadow, noise, odor, traffic,
drainage, and utilities on neighboring properties.
   (e)   Variations, exceptions and/or modifications of these Regulations may
be made by the Planning Commission in specific cases where it is deemed that
unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modification
or adjustment of these Regulations, or for special developments of rental units
or new concepts of solar orientation or other methods of platting, provided
that such plats are self-contained and do not encroach unfavorably on or
interfere with the normal development of abutting properties.
   (f)   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided
is unsuitable for development due to flooding, inadequate drainage, topography,
inadequate water supply, inadequate sanitary sewage disposal, schools,
transportation facilities or other such conditions which may endanger health,
life, or property; and if from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned, it is determined that in the best interest of the public the land
should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not
approve the land for subdivision.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.03 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS ENCOURAGED.
   The planned unit development (PUD) approach to development is encouraged by
the Planning Commission. These Regulations may be modified by the degree
necessary to accomplish the objectives and standards required by the planned
unit development of residential, commercial or industrial subdivisions, or a
mixture thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the zoning resolution.
Nothing within this section, however, shall exempt the developer from the
requirements of subdivision plat approval as specified in Chapter
1169. All planned unit developments will be under the jurisdiction of the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.04 BLOCKS.
   (a)   Blocks shall be designed to accommodate lots of a size and character
required for the zoning district in which the development is located and to
provide convenient circulation, service and safety on boundary streets. The
blocks shall be designed so that the rear lot lines shall coincide with
drainage courses, railroads and divisions in land uses.
   (b)   The maximum length of blocks shall be one thousand three hundred and
twenty (1,320) feet. The Planning Commission may require a crosswalk at
approximately the center of the block in blocks that exceed nine hundred (900)
feet in length.
   (c)   The width of blocks shall be sufficient to provide for an ultimate
development of two (2) tiers of lots between streets and eliminate double
frontage lots. A single tier of lots, having a greater depth than the required
minimum, may be required to separate residential development from major or
arterial streets, adjoining non-residential land uses, or unusual topographic
or natural features. An easement of at least ten (10) feet in width for
screening, which shall not be transversed by vehicles, may be required along
the lots abutting such a major or arterial street or non-residential land use.
   (d)   Where all or part of a subdivision is adjacent to or in the vicinity
of a primary or secondary street, the greater dimension of blocks shall
generally parallel the primary or secondary streets to avoid unnecessary
ingress and egress.
   (e)   Blocks for multi-family residential, commercial or industrial uses
shall be adequate to accommodate the building sites and provide the yards,
service drives, off-street parking and other required facilities
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
 
1177.05 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT LOT DESIGN.
   (a)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots provide
satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and
the character of the surrounding development.
   (b)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
Regulations and the zoning requirements for the district in which they are
located and the use for which they are intended.
   (c)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines, except where the Planning Commission
determines that a variation to this rule provides a better street and lot
layout.
   (d)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the Planning
Commission determines that double frontage lots are essential to provide
separation of residential development from arterial streets or non-residential
land uses, as provided in Section
1177.04(c).
   (e)   Corner residential lots shall have extra width sufficient to maintain
building lines on both streets, as required by the Delta Zoning Code.
   (f)   All lots shall abut on a dedicated street.
   (g)   Utility easements should generally follow rear lot lines, where it is
not practicable to install utilities within the road right of way, and provide
continuous easement to public ways.
   (h)   Lot areas computed for the purpose of meeting minimum requirements
listed above shall not include lands dedicated for use as street or road rights
of way or other public use.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.06 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT LOT DESIGN.
   (a)   A commercial subdivision may show lots which need not conform to any
minimum width or area, except those required in the Zoning Ordinance, but such
subdivisions shall show the location within which buildings may be erected and
the area that is to be reserved for off-street parking and service areas.
   (b)   The location for vehicular movements between the subdivision and
adjacent streets shall be indicated, and restrictions shall be recorded upon
the plat which will restrict such vehicular movement to the location shown on
the plat.
   (c)   Easements may be required providing for vehicular movements through
parking areas and to and from service areas, as well as easements which can be
for residential use. The installation of plantings, walls, fences, or other
improvements that will assure a satisfactory buffer or protective screen within
such easement may be required.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
 
1177.07 OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION.
   (a)   Where the subdivision contains a street, park, school or other public
area which is shown upon the Future Land Use Plan as intended for public
ownership, all or part of such area shall either be dedicated to the proper
public agency or it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby, within a
specified period by a purchase or other means and an agreement shall be entered
into between the subdivider and the proper public agency regarding the time and
method of acquisition and the cost thereof, or an agreement shall be made by
the appropriate public agency upon an alternate location that is satisfactory
to the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of outstanding natural
and cultural features such as scenic spots, watercourses, historic sites, and
substantial stands of trees.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.08 LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Reasonable landscaping should be provided at site entrances, in public
areas, and adjacent to buildings. The type and amount of landscaping required
shall be allowed to vary with type of development.
   (b)   The plant or other landscaping material that best serves the intended
function shall be selected. Landscaping materials shall be appropriate for the
local environment, soil conditions, and availability of water. The impact of
the proposed landscaping plan at various time intervals shall also considered.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.09 CIRCULATION SYSTEM DESIGN.
   (a)   The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and
orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present
and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect
natural features and topography; and to present an attractive streetscape.
   (b)   In residential subdivisions, the road system shall be designed to
serve the needs of the neighborhood and to discourage use by through traffic.
   (c)   The pedestrian system shall be located as required for safety and
shall meet all applicable Village ordinances. In conventional developments,
walks shall be placed parallel to and along both sides of all streets, with
exceptions permitted to preserve natural features or to provide visual
interest. In planned unit developments, walks may be placed away from the road
system, but they may also be required parallel to the street for safety
reasons.
   (d)   Bikeways, greenways, hiking trails or other alternative pedestrian
linkages should be provided where a connection to an existing system is readily
available.
   (e)   New streets shall be a continuation of existing streets or provide a
minimum jog of one hundred twenty (120) feet from the existing street
alignment.
   (f)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets, or stub streets, shall be permitted only as part of a continuing
street plan, and only if a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the Commission
in design is provided and provisions for maintenance, removal, and ultimate
extension are advanced. Temporary dead-end streets longer than two hundred
(200) feet shall not be permitted. Where temporary dead-end streets are
permitted, all requirements of Section
1181.05 shall be satisfied.
   (g)   Cul-de-sac streets shall not be over six hundred (600) feet in length
and the terminal shall be a circular area, with no center island, with a
minimum diameter of one hundred (100) feet, provided, however, that in
exceptional circumstances the Planning Commission may approve different
arrangements.
   (h)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause a
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide convenient access to it, and shall further the development of a
coherent neighborhood street pattern in the vicinity of the subdivision.
Subdividers are encouraged to leave open space in such areas as may provide
future street rights of way for new or extended streets onto adjoining
properties.
   (i)   Dedication of half-streets shall not be accepted unless exceptional
circumstances are found by the Planning Commission to justify the same. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the tract
being subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission.
   (j)   Alleys shall not be used in residential subdivisions except when
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to meet unusual conditions.
   (k)   Frontage on high volume traffic ways shall be provided with parallel
service streets, or buffering as provided in Section
1177.04(c), or such other means of minimizing access as may be appropriate to
the conditions.
   (l)   The angle of intersection between minor streets should not vary by
more than ten (10) degrees from a right angle. All other streets should
intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible and no intersection
of streets at angles of less than sixty (60) degrees shall be permitted.
   (m)   Access restriction controlling ingress and egress to streets may be
required by the Planning Commission to minimize points of intersection and to
relieve congestion at intersections. Direct access to streets within six
hundred (600) feet of a major intersection shall not be provided except where
it is the only access to property and in such cases should be avoided whenever
possible and in all cases will be limited in number.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.10 COMMERCIAL STREET DESIGN.
   (a)   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas
shall be planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic
on local streets. The intersections of driveways from parking areas with
arterial or collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least
possible interference with traffic movement on the streets, and shall be
located not less than one hundred (100) feet from the intersection of an
arterial or collector street with any other street, and shall be spaced not
less than two hundred (200) feet from each other. The Commission may require
marginal access streets to provide maximum safety and convenience.
   (b)   Alleys are required in the rear of all commercial lots if no other
provisions are made for adequate service access or for parking. The rights of
way for such alleys shall be not less than twenty (20) feet and dead-end alleys
shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.11 INDUSTRIAL STREET DESIGN.
   (a)   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to
serve industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so
that no industrial traffic will be directed into any residential streets. The
intersections of service streets from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall be not less than one hundred (100) feet from the intersection of
the arterial or collector street with any other street. Streets shall be
planned to extend to the boundaries of any adjoining land planned for industry,
except in the case of severe physical conditions or where the Commission finds
such extension is not in accord with the approved Future Land Use Plan of the
area.
   (b)   Alleys are required in the rear of all industrial lots if no other
provisions are made for adequate service access or for parking. The rights of
way for such alleys shall be not less than twenty (20) feet and dead-end alleys
shall not be permitted.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1177.12 UTILITY AND DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Easements of at least fifteen (15) feet in width centered along rear
and/or side lot lines shall be provided for sanitary sewers, gas mains,
waterlines, and electric lines or other utilities where it is not practicable
to locate said utilities within the road right of way. Easements of greater
width may be required along or across lots where necessary for the extension of
main sewers or other utilities, where both water and sewer lines are located in
the same easement, or where the Commission feels that such widths are necessary
to provide adequate access.
   (b)   Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located in
the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement
along each side of the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening,
relocating, improving or protecting the stream for drainage or recreational
use.

responsibilities for private lines so installed. The subdivider must agree to
tap into the public sewer system should public sewers be extended to the
property.
   (c)   Where exceptional circumstances warrant, as determined by the Planning
Commission, the subdivider may provide an adequate private sanitary treatment
plant, or package plant, and the necessary sanitary sewer lines accessible to
each lot. The system, where practicable, is to be designed so it can be
integrated into the master plan of sanitary sewers when the public sewers are
installed.
   (d)   Where exceptional circumstances warrant, as determined by the Planning
Commission, the subdivider may provide private on-site sewage disposal systems,
typically a septic tank and leach field system, for lots of one (1) acre or
more in area if soil percolation tests, as prescribed by the appropriate Board
of Health, have indicated a reasonably useful life for such disposal methods
and all other relevant requirements of the appropriate Board of Health have
been met. Other private onsite disposal methods may be approved by the
appropriate Board of Health.
   (e)   Where a public sanitary sewer extension is provided by the developer,
such sanitary sewer lines shall be installed within the public road right-of-
way, unless exceptional circumstances warrant their location elsewhere.

1181.10 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   Prior to the granting of Final Plat approval, the subdivider shall have
installed or shall have furnished adequate bond, as provided in Section
1181.13 hereof, for the ultimate installation of the following:
   (a)   All necessary facilities, including underground pipe, inlets, catch
basins or open drainage ditches shall be installed to provide for the adequate
disposal of surface water and to maintain any natural drainage course. Storm
drainage, including drain tile around basements, shall not be permitted to
discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall connect to an adequate
drainage outlet.
   (b)   Catch basins shall be installed in street gutters and located so that
not more than four hundred (400) feet of gutter is drained into any basin. The
catch basins shall conform to ODOT Construction and Material Specifications
Item 604.
   (c)   Storm sewers shall be installed to outlet the street catch basins and
to provide storm drainage for the lots. Storm sewers shall extend to the
farthest lot line and terminate in a manhole that conforms to ODOT Construction
and Material Specifications Item 604. These sewers shall be a minimum of twelve
(12) inches in diameter and consist of tongue and groove, sealed joint, rigid
pipe or an approval equal. All storm sewers under the pavement and curbs shall
be of reinforced or extra strength pipe and shall be backfilled with granular
material in concurrence with ODOT Construction and Material Specifications Item
603 Type B conduit specifications. All sewers shall be laid with a gradient
that will provide a minimum full flow velocity of two (2) feet per second.
   (d)   All storm sewers must be inspected by a representative of the Village
and thereby obtain approval from the Village before backfilling. Final
acceptance of the storm sewer system will not be made without this approval.
   (e)   In order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
people, the Planning Commission may reject any proposed subdivision located in
an area subject to periodic flooding, and may reject any proposed subdivision
located in a one hundred (100) year floodplain, as identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or other appropriate authority. If the subdivision
is located in an area having poor drainage or other adverse physical
characteristics, the Commission may approve the subdivision provided the
subdivider designs the subdivision to mitigate and minimize the disturbance of
the one hundred (100) year floodplain. In lieu of improvements, the subdivider
shall furnish adequate bond, as provided in Section
1181.13 hereof, covering the cost of the required improvements.
   (f)   Where natural drainage channels intersect the street right-of-way, it
shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to have satisfactory bridges and/
or culverts constructed. Where culverts are required, the following minimum
requirements shall be observed:
      (1)   All culverts shall extended across the entire right-of-way width of
the proposed road. The cover over the culvert and its capacity shall be
approved by the responsible government official, depending upon jurisdiction.
The minimum diameter of a culvert pipe shall be 18 inches. Head walls,
depending on existing drainage conditions, may be required.
      (2)   Driveway culverts shall have a minimum length of twenty (20) feet.
The diameter of driveway culverts shall be subject to the approval of the
responsible governmental official, depending upon jurisdiction. The driveway
culverts shall be laid so as to maintain the flow lines of the ditch or gutter.
Head walls may be required.
   (g)   Standards and Specifications for Drainage Facilities: The construction
of storm water drainage improvements shall be subject to the approval of the
authority having jurisdiction.
      (Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1181.11 MONUMENTS.
   Prior to the granting of Final Plat approval, the subdivider shall have
installed the following:
   (a)   A permanent concrete monument, as defined in Section
1165.01(41) of these Regulations, shall be placed on the centerline of the
right-of-way of each street intersection, at the beginning and end of all
street curves, and at such other points as are necessary to establish
definitely all lines of the plat.
   (b)   Iron pipe or pins shall be placed at the corners of all lots and at
other points as are required by the Planning Commission.
      (Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1181.12 TELEPHONE, ELECTRIC AND OTHER UTILITIES.
   (a)   All distribution wires and cables including electrical distribution
and telephone and cablevision wires and cables, and those wires and cables used
for street lighting, shall be installed underground in accordance with
standards and regulations promulgated by the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio and by the public utility supplying such service. The Planning Commission
may waive in whole or part the above requirements where a strict application
thereof would result in excessive removal of trees or for other aesthetic
reasons.
   (b)   Where practicable, utilities such as electrical distribution and
telephone and cablevision wires and cables shall be placed within the public
road right of way or within designated utility easements centered along rear
and/or side lot lines.
(Ord. 95-35. Passed 11-20-95.)
1181.13 IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEES.
   (a)   Improvement guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper
installation and maintenance of required street, utility and other improvements
as specified in Chapter
1181 hereof. The nature and duration of the guarantee shall be structured to
achieve this goal without adding unnecessary costs to the developer.
   (b)   No Final Plat of any subdivision shall be approved until:
      (1)   The improvements listed in Sections
1181.01 to
1181.12, inclusive, hereof have been completed; or
      (2)   The subdivider has filed with the Clerk/Treasurer a surety bond in
the amount of one hundred (100) percent of the estimated cost of construction
of the improvements, or a cashier's check or certified check in the amount of
ten (10) percent of the project cost, approved by the Planning Commission and
the Solicitor, guaranteeing to the Village the completion of such improvements
in a satisfactory manner within such time, not to exceed two (2) years, as may
be fixed by the Commission. The bond or checks shall be approved by the
Solicitor and shall be made payable to, and enforceable by the Village of
Delta, Ohio.
   (c)   Upon application of the subdivider, the Planning Commission may waive
compliance with subsection (b) hereof upon the following conditions:
      (1)   No lot or land abutting the unopened and improved street shall be
sold and/or conveyed until said lot or land is in conformity with subsection
(b)(1) or (b)(2) hereof. However, with the consent of the Planning Commission,
all of such abutting lots or land may be sold and/or conveyed as one unit; and
      (2)   No building or zoning permit shall be issued or buildings
constructed on lots or land abutting an unopened and unimproved street until
the conditions set forth in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) hereof have been
complied with.
   (d)   In the event the developer fails to complete the installation of all
improvements according to the terms and conditions of subsection (b)(2) hereof,
the Village, upon proper notice, may complete same and appropriate such portion
of money or bonds posted for the faithful performance of said work.
   (e)   Inspections during installation of improvements shall be made by the
Village of Delta to insure conformity with the approved Technical Design and
Construction Plans and other specifications. The subdivider shall be liable for
costs incurred for necessary inspections during construction. An amount
covering the estimated costs of such inspections shall be deposited with the
Planning Commission prior to commencing the work. The subdivider shall notify
the proper administrative officials twenty-four (24) hours prior to commencing
work.
   (f)   Upon completion of all required improvements, the developer shall
notify the Planning Commission, in writing, of the completion of improvements
and request a final inspection, and shall send a copy of said notification to
the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer shall inspect all improvements of
which such notice has been given and shall file a detailed report, in writing,
with the Planning Commission indicating approval, partial approval, or
rejection of such improvements with a statement of reason for any rejection.
   (g)   The Village Council shall either approve, partially approve, or reject
the improvements on the basis of the report of the Village Engineer, and shall
notify the developer in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of the
report and the action no later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the
notice of completion from the developer. Failure of the Council to send or
provide such notification to the developer within forty-five (45) days shall be
deemed to constitute approval of the improvements, and the obliger and surety,
if any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance
guarantee for such improvements.
   (h)   Where partial approval is granted, the developer shall be released
from the portion of the escrow deposit or surety as designated for the
completed improvements. However, the final ten (10) percent of the escrow
deposit of surety shall not be released to the subdivider until all
construction or installation covered by the said escrow deposit or surety is
completed, inspected and accepted by the respective governmental authorities.

than ten nor more than one thousand dollars.

      (5)   This Code establishes minimum requirements for the initial and/or
continued occupancy of all buildings and structures and does not replace or

alteration, or use of buildings, equipment or facilities except as provided in
this section.
   (b)   Inspection.

      (5)   Inspections shall be made between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. unless the premises are not available during the foregoing hours for
inspections, or there is reason to believe a violation exists of a character
which is an immediate threat to health or safety, thereby requiring inspection
and abatement without delay or notification.
   (c)   Certificate of Necessity.   
      (1)   Where any owner is required to make repairs or otherwise improve
his property and is unable to comply with this Code without having the right to
access to the structure, accessory structure or premises through or across
adjoining premises not owned by him or under his control, and where right of
access has been refused the owner, agent or occupant, or where the owner or
person responsible for granting permission cannot be found or located, then,
upon filing of an affidavit setting forth the facts with the Administrator, the
Administrator shall serve a five day notice in writing, of a hearing upon the
owner, the agent, or the occupant of any adjoining premises affected by the
application.
      (2)   On the day fixed for the hearing, the Board shall provide
opportunity for the owner of the adjoining property or properties to state why
access should not be granted across such adjoining properties.
      (3)   If the Board determines that access is deemed necessary for the
compliance with this Code, the Board shall, with the approval of the Mayor,
direct the Law Director, or his designee, to take such steps as are necessary
to acquire access to the adjoining property. These actions may include, but are
not limited to the following:
         A.   The acquisition of an easement by the Municipality on the
adjoining property;

paragraph (2) hereinabove.
         B.   In the event the offending owner fails to provide proof that a
qualified and insured individual will perform the required repairs or other
improvements prior to said hearing, the Board shall deny the right of access to
the offending owner.
      (5)   No such action legally obligating the Municipality shall be taken
by the Law Director without the Village first having entered into a contract
with the offending property owner requiring said property owner to reimburse
the Municipality for the direct costs it may incur as a result of these
procedures.
   (d)   Entry. The Administrator is hereby authorized to enter on and into and
inspect all structures, accessory structures or premises subject to the
provisions of this Code for the purposes of determining whether there is
compliance with its provisions:
      (1)   Upon presentation of proper credentials, the Administrator may
enter at reasonable times, any structure, accessory structure or premises in
the Village to perform any duty imposed on him by this Code.
      (2)   If an owner or occupant shall refuse, impede, inhibit, interfere
with, restrict or obstruct entry and free access to any part of the structure
or premises where inspection authorized by this Code is sought, the
Administrator may seek in a court of competent jurisdiction, a warrant or that
such owner or occupant cease and desist with such interference and/or granting
necessary access by the Administrator to the subject property.
   (e)   Notice to Abate Violations. 
      (1)   Whenever the Administrator determines that any structure, accessory
structure, dwelling, dwelling unit, or premises thereof, fails to meet the
provisions set forth in this Code or in applicable rules or regulations adopted
pursuant thereto, he shall make reasonable effort to advise the owner or agent
of the violation in person. In the event that personal contact cannot be made,
the Administrator shall send by regular mail a notice stating the nature of the
violation found and request personal contact by the owner or agent. In the
event that the violation has not been corrected after personal contact or after
fourteen days from the date of the mailing of notice required herein, no
personal contact has been made, or whenever the Administrator determines that
an emergency situation exists pursuant to subsection (h) hereof, a notice shall
be issued either in person or by certified mail to the owner or agent that such
violations must be corrected. This notice shall:
         A.   Be in writing.
         B.   Set forth the alleged violations of this Code or of applicable
rules and regulations pursuant thereto.

identification.
         D.   Be served upon the owner and/or agent of a structure, dwelling,
dwelling unit, accessory structure or premises, personally or by certified
mail, addressed to the last known place of residence or business of the owner,
agent or authorized person in control. In all cases where a violation exists,
the owner must be served with a copy of the order to abate violation by regular
U.S. mail. Any notice of the Administrator of violations of subsection (f)
hereof shall be made either personally or by certified mail. In the event
notice cannot be effected by either of those two means, service may be made by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the community.
         E.   Provide a stated reasonable time, not to exceed ninety days for
the correction of any alleged violation, except a longer reasonable period of
time will be allowed for exterior painting, concrete and roofing work or other
corrections which cannot be properly completed in cold weather or for other
good cause.
         F.   Shall state a time and place for an administrative hearing before
the Hearing Officer.
      (2)   If one or more persons to whom such notice is addressed cannot be
found after a diligent effort to do so, service may be made upon such person or
persons by posting a notice on or about the structure, dwelling, dwelling unit,
accessory structure or premises described in such notice.
         A.   The Administrator shall reinspect the property upon the
expiration of the time set forth in such notice. The findings of the
reinspection shall be supplied to the owner and/or agent or authorized person
in control of the structure, dwelling, dwelling unit, accessory structure or
premises.
         B.   If, upon reinspection, good cause has been shown why the alleged
violations have not been corrected, the Administrator may extend the time to
comply with the original notice.
      (3)   A.   At the hearing, the person served with the notice of violation
may present evidence to refute the necessity to perform the acts set forth in
the notice to abate violations. The Code Administrator may also present
evidence indicating why the notice was given.
         B.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer may do one
of three things:

reasonable time period in which the property owner must abate the violation,
beginning with the day subsequent to the hearing.
            2.   Refute the findings of the Administrator and revoke the work
order.
            3.   Modify (or refute) any part of the work order, including
reasonable time of completion.
         C.   The Hearing Officer shall make all findings in writing. A copy of
such findings shall be delivered to the appellant either by certified mail or
personal delivery.
         D.   Whenever the findings of the Hearing Officer require any person
to perform any act, such findings shall constitute a notice to abate
violations. Failure to comply with such notice shall constitute a violation of
this section.
      (4)   The requirement that an individual abate a violation of this Code
pursuant to this chapter shall not terminate by reason of sale of the property
for which such violation has occurred unless the purchaser of the property:
         A.   Has received notice of the order to abate violations and the time
period for the correction of the violations; and
         B.   Has agreed to assume the responsibility for repairing the
violation.
   (f)   Structures Unfit for Human Habitation or Unsafe for Use. 
      (1)   Should the Administrator, after conducting inspection pursuant to

abatement, the Administrator shall be obligated to perform the following

         B.   Contact the Fire Chief when appropriate;
         C.   Contact the County Health Department when appropriate;

1311.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the Village of Delta, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 11-04. Passed 2-28-11.)
1311.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Delta has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. (Ord. 05-10. Passed 9-6-
05.)
1311.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
    It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. 05-10. Passed 9-6-05.)
1311.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,

   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
      (Ord. 05-10. Passed 9-6-05.)
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
      (Ord. 11-04. Passed 2-28-11.)
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge in no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic Structure” any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U. S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change” (LOMC) means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F is a determination concerning whether a structure
or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is,
therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMP) A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured Home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured Home Park” means a specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes,
used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes,
and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program” (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
      (Ord. 05-10. Passed 9-6-05.)
   (z)   “New Construction” means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Delta Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 15, 1984, and includes any subsequent

   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational Vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area” also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of Construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

1311.22 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1311.25 Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail. (Ord. 05-10. Passed 9-6-05.)
1311.23 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damage to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1311.21(a);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Village of Delta and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsections (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5. (Ord. 05-10. Passed
9-6-05.)
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Delta specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1311.21(a)(1)C.,when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
      (4)   Compensatory storage required for fill. Fill within the area of
special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special
flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage
by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development
site.
         A.   Fill. The following standards shall apply to all fill activities
in special flood hazard areas:
            1.   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or
placed, must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with
the Standard Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method.
            2.   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two
feet horizontal.
            3.   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for
fill slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood
of five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be
provided. When expected velocities during the base flood area five feet per
second or less, protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative
cover.
            4.   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
               (Ord. 11-04. Passed 2-28-11.)
1311.25 APPEALS AND VARIANCES
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.  
      (1)   The Village of Delta Council shall appoint an Appeals Board

terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by the Village of
Delta Council. Each member shall serve until his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasijudicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Office of the Village Clerk.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.
         A.   The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a public hearing within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for a variance from the
FlooUplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of such hearing shall
be give in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the community
at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 05-10. Passed 9-6-05.)

CHAPTER 1529
Fire Damaged Structures
1529.01   Structure fire loss insurance proceeds.
 
1529.01 STRUCTURE FIRE LOSS INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The Village is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D) whereby no insurance company doing business in the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure under
all policies exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless there is
compliance with the following procedures.
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Delta Fire Chief in the aggregate
one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and
each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or if at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance company or
companies the named insured or insureds have submitted a contractor’s signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate. Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining
after the transfer to the Village insured or insureds may submit a contractor’s
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or
insureds, provided that the Village has not commenced to remove, repair or
secure the building or other structure.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the proceeds by the Village as authorized by this
section, the Fire Chief shall place the proceeds in the Village Treasury in a
sub-fund within Special State and County Fund, entitled Special State Fire Loss
Insurance, to be used solely as security against the total cost of removing,
repairing or securing incurred by the Village pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a) hereof an insurance
company shall provide the Village with the name and address of the named
insured or insureds, whereupon the Village shall contact the named insured or
insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the Village and
notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when repairs or
removal or securing the building or other structure has been completed and the
required proof received by the designated officer, if the Village has not
incurred any costs for such repairs, removal or securing. If the Village has
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain,
the Village shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or
insureds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of a
municipal corporation to recover any deficiency and the named insured or
insureds from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to
the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the
damaged property has been negotiated.
   (c)   The Fire Chief is hereby designated as the officer authorized to carry
out the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a certified copy of
this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State. Any owner or
his agent duly authorized to have supervision over any property of the owner,
or any occupant of the buildings, who refuses to obey the orders of any of the
officials heretofore designated or their agents, or who delays unreasonably any
longer than sixty days, in compliance therewith, shall be fined not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than six months or both.
