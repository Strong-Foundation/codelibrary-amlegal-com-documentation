   WHEREAS, a determination has been made that the ordinances of the
Municipality of a permanent and general nature should be recodified, and
   WHEREAS, the Village has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter
H. Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinance, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council;
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF PENINSULA,
STATE OF OHIO:
   SECTION 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Peninsula, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Peninsula,
Ohio.
   SECTION 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 6 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to October 1, 2015, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows: the enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall
not be construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any
legislative provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an
action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and codification.

EDITOR'S NOTE
    The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or
occurs.

the event that a warning has been issued and the offending individual does not
immediately discontinue his or her offending behavior, the Mayor shall provide
for the removal of the offending individual by ordering an officer of the
Peninsula Police Department to extricate the offending person from the public
hearing by any and all means necessary. Subsequently the offending individual
shall be subject to the penalties outlined in subsections 1 and 2 of this
Article, as they may apply, as well as any other criminal or civil penalties to
which their actions may also subject them.
Penalty Clause 1: FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION OF THIS ORDINANCE, THE VIOLATOR WILL
NOT BE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN STILL PHOTOGRAPHY, VIDEO TAPING OR AUDIO TAPING
OF A PUBLIC MEETING FOR A PERIOD UP TO SIX- MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE
OFFENSE.
Penalty Clause 2: FOR EACH ADDITIONAL VIOLATION OF THIS ORDINANCE, THE VIOLATOR
WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN STILL PHOTOGRAPHY, VIDEO TAPING OR AUDIO
TAPING OF A PUBLIC MEETING FOR A PERIOD UP TO ONE YEAR, AS DETERMINED FROM THE
DATE OF THE OFFENSE.
      (2)   In the event that an individual is warned under Section A, Article
4 of this Ordinance and subsequently penalized under Penalty Clause 1 or 2 of
Section A, Article 4 of the same; and said individual wishes to contest the
grounds for his or her removal, that individual must file an appeal with the
Council within thirty calendar days from the effective date of his or her
removal. Failure to contest the removal order in a timely fashion shall be
considered a waiver of all valid disputes and contests related to this
ordinance. For the calculation of a valid waiver, calendar days shall exclude
weekends and government holidays recognized by the Village, the State of Ohio
and the Federal Government.
      (3)   A Removal Order shall be contested in a public hearing before the
Village Council, which shall hear the matter en banc. The Village Council shall
conduct the hearing within ninety days of a timely filed appeal, which shall be
properly tendered to the Village Clerk of Courts. The matter shall be heard
before no less than a majority of duly elected Village Council Members. The
Village Solicitor shall present any evidence of disruptive conduct alleged by
the Mayor or his agents and shall bear the burden of proof and production for
the same. The individual warned and sanctioned shall then have the opportunity
to dispute the same conduct by providing evidence to the contrary in a fair and
open hearing before the Council. The Village Council, by majority vote, shall
determine to a quantum of proof by the preponderance of the evidence, whether
the warning was well taken and subsequently whether the penalty should be
imposed.
      (4)   This is an administrative penalty only. It does not bear with it
the imprimatur of a criminal or civil sanction and shall not be so construed.

insure the proper use of Village credit cards and debit cards.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Credit Card Account. Any bank issued credit card account, financial
institution-issued credit card account, financial depository-issued credit card
account, or any other card or credit account allowing the holder to purchase
goods or services on credit, and any debit or gift card account related to the

spending) and store gift cards (not related to the receipt of grant monies).
      (2)   Procurement Card Account. A card issued to designated users to make
purchases at selected businesses. Procurement cards can be tied to either a
credit card or bank account. Security measures for procurement cards include
setting per-purchase and per-month dollar limits. Procurement cards may also
feature spending restrictions for the types of purchases allowed and merchant
category codes which define where purchases can and cannot be made. A bank that
manages a procurement card will issue payments to payees within days, while
providing monthly invoicing to the Village. The Fiscal Officer and appropriate
department head must review and approve those invoices prior to payment.
      (3)   Gasoline Card. A card utilized strictly for fuel and automotive
supplies, parts, repairs, or purchases.
      (4)   Presentation Instrument. Any card, check, or account number which
can be used to purchase goods or services, including online purchasing

institution which allows the holder to transfer money electronically to another
bank account when making a transaction. For the purposes of this Policy, a
debit card also includes: a single-use cash gift card (not related to the
receipt of grant monies) with a set dollar amount that may be accepted by any
retailer that is void upon spending the balance or expiration; and a prepaid
gift card (not related to the receipt of grant monies) that is reloadable,
unlike a cash gift card.
      (6)   Bank Credit Card. A general spending credit card issued by a bank
in the name of the Authorized User and the Village.
      (7)   Store/Company Credit Card.  A credit card that can only be used for
the purchase of goods at or from a specific store or retailer.
      (8)   Store Gift Card. A credit card that is preloaded with a set dollar
amount that may be used only at a specific retailer.
      (9)   Card Account.  All of the accounts defined in this subsection (b)
hereof may be collectively referred to herein as "card accounts".
   (c)    Authorized Users of Village Cards. The Mayor, Fiscal Officer, Police
Chief, Street Commissioner, Service Department Supervisor, and Administrative
Clerk may, but are not required to, be issued Village bank cards imprinted with
their name and the Village of Peninsula. Store or Company credit cards may be
issued to and in the name of the above persons or may be issued just in the
name of the Village. Procurement and gasoline cards may be used by members of
the Police and Service Departments in accordance with the provisions of this
Policy and any rules or directives of those departments regarding the use of
the cards.
   (d)    Authorized Expenses. Village cards may only be used for expenses
related to Village operations, travel and meetings, Village vehicles, Village
equipment and supplies, and Village maintenance needs.
   (e)   Management of Card Accounts.
      (1)   For cards issued in the name of the Village and an authorized user:
         A.    Each time an authorized user is hired by or takes office with
the Village, the bank, store, or retailer shall be notified in writing by the
Fiscal Officer. The bank, store or retailer's card application form shall be
signed by the Fiscal Officer, the Mayor, and the authorized user, who shall
also provide the bank with a copy of his/her driver's license and any other
documentation the bank may reasonably require prior to the issuance of the
card.
         B.    Upon separation from employment or office with the Village,
authorized users shall return their cards to the Fiscal Officer, who shall be
responsible for the cancellation and destruction of the cards.
         C.    Authorized users shall retain control over and be solely
responsible for securing the cards issued to them and shall immediately report
a lost or stolen card to the bank, store, or retailer and the Fiscal Officer.
The card shall only be reissued upon the request of the Fiscal Officer, who
shall be responsible for obtaining the replacement card.
      (2)   For cards issued only in the name of the Village that are
maintained in the general possession of the Fiscal Officer and signed out to
authorized users pursuant to the following system:
         A.   The Fiscal Officer or his or her designee has prepared a card
sign out sheet for each Village card of this type, requiring the name of the
authorized user signing out the card, the date and time the card was signed
out, the signature of the authorized user signing out the card, and the
signature of either the Mayor, Fiscal Officer, Fiscal Office Assistant, or
Administrative Clerk (confirming that the card was signed out by the authorized
user and the information on the sheet for that card sign out is correct).
         B.   When the card is returned, the Mayor, Fiscal Officer, Fiscal
Office Assistant, or Administrative Clerk will indicate on the sign out sheet
the date and time the card was returned. The authorized user returning the card
will also sign the sheet indicating the information on the form for that sign
out and return of the card is correct and complete.
         C.   The above requirements establish a two-step verification process
as to the date and time the card was signed out and returned and the person
that signed out and returned the card.
         D.   While the card is signed out, the person signing out the card
retains control over and is solely responsible for securing the card. In the
event the card is lost or stolen while the card is signed out, the person
signing out the card shall immediately report the lost or stolen card to the
bank, store, or retailer and the Fiscal Officer. Thereafter, the Fiscal Officer
shall be responsible for obtaining the replacement card.
         E.   For gasoline cards that are maintained by the Police Department
or Service Department, the department member utilizing the card shall follow
all department rules or directives regarding the use of the card such as the
purposes for which the card can be used and indicating the employee using the
card's identification number, the identification number of the vehicle getting
the fuel or equipment, and the mileage of the vehicle.
   (f)   Card Checks. The Village does not maintain or authorize the use of
checks associated with card accounts.
   (g)   Debit Cards.  The Village does not maintain or authorize the use of
debit cards unless specifically deemed necessary for use by the Police
Department for a law enforcement purpose. The requirements of this Policy do
not apply to debit card accounts related to the receipt of grant monies.
   (h)   Purchase Authorization and Submission of Receipts.  When a purchase
for items other than those covered by blanket purchase orders are anticipated,
a purchase order requisition is prepared by the authorized user making the
purchase, the department head of the authorized user making the purchase or his
or her designee, or a department assistant with the authorization of the
department head. The purchase order requisition must be authorized and signed
by the department head. The purchase order requisition is submitted to the
Fiscal Officer so that a purchase order can be prepared or it can be determined
that a purchase order is already in place with sufficient funds. Once the
purchase has been made, the authorized user making the purchase must submit the
receipt or an online order confirmation to the Fiscal Officer for attachment to
the purchase requisition. If a cash register receipt does not contain an
itemized description of the item(s) purchased, the authorized user shall write
it on the receipt prior to submission.
   (i)   Tax Exempt Status.  The Village of Peninsula is exempt from Ohio sales
taxes, and authorized users shall inform in-state suppliers of this exempt
status and provide a copy of the Village's Tax Exempt Certification if
necessary.

control of the Fiscal Officer) to use the card.
      (6)   Use of the card to make any purchase that violates any Village
policy or the State of Ohio Ethics Law prohibiting business transactions that
are or may be perceived as a conflict of interest (i.e., purchases from a
business in which the authorized user, a family member, or a business associate
has a financial or other interest).
      (7)   Receipt of cash refunds or in-store credit for any returns or
exchanges. Such amounts must be credited back to the card account. If a
supplier issues a refund by check or other means, it must be submitted to the
Fiscal Officer within five (5) days of its receipt by the authorized user.
      (8)   The authorized user is personally liable and liable upon any
official bond he/she has given to the Village to reimburse the Village for any
and all amounts for which the authorized user does not provide itemized
receipts in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (g) of this
section of the Policy.
      (9)   The use of a card account for expenses beyond those authorized by
Council.

accounts issued, the cards' and accounts' expiration dates, the cards' and
accounts' credit limits, and all card statements for the previous quarter. On

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.

that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the

entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Peninsula .
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Peninsula income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this

be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Peninsula income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.

more members of such an affiliated group.

municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other

         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
            (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations
of estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed
by the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Peninsula, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after

   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
           (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
           (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Peninsula under Section
181.05 for that year.
           (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of
Peninsula but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.

181.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter/ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or

fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If
a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round
all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 8-2015. Passed 10-13-15.)
181.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
181.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
          (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars or more;
           (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars or more.
    (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter/ordinance,
requests for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or
paid, whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to
file with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's
claim for a refund.
           (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
           (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
           (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
           (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 8-2015. Passed 10-13-15.)
181.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with Peninsula, Ohio but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Peninsula, Ohio
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
 
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Peninsula is subject to recovery by the
Village. If the Village of Peninsula's tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the Village of Peninsula shall allow a nonrefundable credit
against the tax or withholding the Village of Peninsulaclaims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
 
   (C)   If the Village of Peninsula's tax rate is less than the tax rate in
the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
the Village of Peninsula's tax rate. However, if the Village of Peninsula's tax
rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in
excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Peninsula,
along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of
nonpayment.
 
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 8-2015. Passed 10-13-15.)
181.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village of Peninsula changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the Village of Peninsula. The amended return shall be filed on a form
required by the Tax Administrator.
           (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated
municipal income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate
return to a consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
181.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
    (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
181.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Peninsula. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
181.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Peninsula's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Peninsula return
showing income subject to the Village of Peninsula income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional Village of Peninsula income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.
(Ord. 8-2015. Passed 10-13-15.)
181.12 LIMITATIONS.

time limit described in division (C) of this section.
           (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
           (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                  (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
181.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
           (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
181.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
181.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover the Village of Peninsula income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
           (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 8-2015. Passed 10-13-15.)
181.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
    (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
 
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 8-2015. Passed 10-13-15.)
181.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
           (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator
has at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address
the Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
           (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
 
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other the Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
           (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
           (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis
described in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject
to collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
    (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax

185.01 SHORT-TERM RENTAL TAX.
   It is the intent of the Village to levy an excise tax of three percent (3%)
on transactions by
which lodging is or is to be furnished in a Short-Term Rental Dwelling to
Transient Guests as referred to and authorized by RC 5739.02((c). Accordingly,
this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so as to be
consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with which is a prerequisite
to the validity of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)    "Administrator" means the individual charged with direct
responsibility for administration of a tax levied by the Village of Peninsula
in accordance with this chapter.
   (b)    "Booking Agent" means any person or entity that facilitates
reservations or collects payment for Short-Term Rental Dwelling accommodations
on behalf of or for a Vendor. Merely publishing an advertisement for
accommodations does not make the publisher a Booking Agent.
   (c)    "Short-Term Rental Dwelling" means every establishment kept, used,
maintained, advertised, or held out to the public to be a place where lodging
for less than thirty consecutive days is offered to guests in one (1) or more
rooms, regardless of use of keyed entry, whether such rooms are in one (1) or
several structures, and whether the rooms are located in different structures
or on different parcels of land if the structures are not identified in
advertisements of the accommodations as distinct establishments.
   (d)    "Transaction Price" means the total amount of consideration,
including money or any other value, paid, or to be paid, or given by, or on
behalf of, a Transient Guest to a Short-Term Rental Dwelling Vendor or Booking
Agent in exchange for lodging. The Transaction Price is the amount advertised
or published to the public inclusive of any fees built into the advertised or
published price; however, service fees or booking fees, if separately stated,
shall not be included in the Transaction Price.
   (e)    "Transient Guest" or "Transient Guests" means a person or persons
occupying a room or rooms for lodging for less than thirty (30) consecutive
days.
   (f)    "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the Short-
Term Rental Dwelling and who furnishes the lodging.
      (Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.03 PURPOSE, RATE, AND APPLICATION OF TAX.
   (a)    There is hereby levied an excise tax of three percent (3%) on
transactions by which lodging at a Short-Term Rental Dwelling is, or is to be,
furnished to Transient Guests.
 
   (b)    The excise tax levied under this chapter shall provide revenue for
the purposes of general municipal operations, procurement of fixed assets or
permanent improvements, payment of debt charges, the elimination of deficits in
Village funds, and for all other lawful purposes. To carry out such purposes,
the receipts of the tax levied under this chapter shall be deposited to the
credit of the General Fund.
   (c)    The tax, which shall be known as the short-term rental tax, applies
and is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time
when the price is paid. The tax shall not apply to transactions by which
lodging is furnished to:
      (1)    The Federal government, the State, or any of its political
subdivisions; or
      (2)    A person maintaining occupancy for a period of thirty (30) or more
consecutive days; provided, however, that except in the case of employees of
the same employer, no occupancy may be used in combination with the occupancy
of another, regardless of the source of payment, to exempt a transaction under
this division.
   (d)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it shall be presumed that all lodging furnished
at Short-Term Rental Dwellings in the Village to Transient Guests is subject to
the tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.04 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY THE TAX.
   (a)    The short-term rental tax shall be paid by the Transient Guest to the
Vendor unless division (b) of this section applies. Each Vendor shall collect
from the Transient Guest the full and exact amount of the tax payable on the
taxable price for each taxable lodging. The tax required to be collected under
this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust by the Vendor until paid to
the Administrator as provided in Section
185.07 of this chapter. If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the
Vendor, the Administrator may require the Transient Guest to pay such tax
directly to the Administrator.
   (b)    A Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor may collect and remit the
short-term rental tax in place of the Vendor, and in that instance, the Vendor
shall not be responsible for collecting the short-term rental tax on any
transaction for which the Vendor has received confirmation that the Booking
Agent has collected and remitted the tax. If the Booking Agent collects the
short-term rental tax, the requirements imposed on the Vendor set forth in
Section 185.04(a) shall be applicable to the Booking Agent.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.05 RECORDS INSPECTION AND PRESERVATION.
   Each Vendor and Booking Agent shall maintain complete and accurate records
of lodging furnished, together with a record of the tax collected thereon. Such
records shall be open and accessible to inspection by the Admi1istrator within
the Village within fifteen (15) days upon notification in writing to the Vendor
or Booking Agent. Such records shall be preserved for a period of three (3)
years, unless the Administrator in writing consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires that they be kept for a longer period of
time.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.06 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The Vendor, or Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor, shall state and
charge the short-term rental tax to the Transient Guest separately from the
charge for the lodging and on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for occupancy issued or
delivered by the Vendor or Booking Agent.
   (b)    No Vendor or Booking Agent shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the Vendor or Booking Agent, or that the tax will not be
added to the amount charged for the lodging, or that, if added, any part will
be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.07 REGULATIONS FOR FILING RETURNS.
   (a)    Each Vendor, or Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor, shall on or
before the last day of the quarter make and file a return for the preceding
quarter, on forms prescribed by the Administrator, showing the receipts from
furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the Vendor, or Booking Agent
collecting for a Vendor, to the Village for the period covered by the return,
and such other information as the Administrator deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. All retur1s shall be signed by the Vendor, its
authorized agent, or Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor. Returns shall be
filed by delivering or mailing the same to the Administrator together with
payment of the full amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   (b)    The Administrator may authorize Vendors, or Booking Agents collecting
for Vendors, whose tax liabilities are not such as to merit quarterly returns
as determined by the Administrator upon the basis of administrative costs of
the Village, to make and file returns at less frequent intervals. Such
authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the intervals at which
returns are to be filed.
   (c)    Each Vendor, or Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor, shall file all
claims for exemption from tax filed by the Transient Guests with the Vendor
during the reporting period with the return.
   (d)    The Administrator shall treat all returns and payments submitted by
Vendors, and Booking Agents collecting for Vendors, as confidential and shall
not release them except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to
an officer or agent of the United States, the State, the County, or the
Village, for official use only, or except as required by law.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.08 REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to Vendors, or Booking
Agents collecting for Vendors, for the amount of tax paid illegally or
erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where the Vendor or
Booking Agent has not reimbursed itself from the Transient Guest. As between a
Vendor and a Booking Agent, the request for refund shall be made by the party
that filed the return containing the illegal or erroneous assessment. A
Transient Guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously, but only when the tax was paid by the Transient Guest
directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid unless the claimant
establishes a right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto and
makes a claim filed within three (3) years of the date of payment in the manner
and on forms prescribed and furnished by the Administrator, and stating under
penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.09 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION BY ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    If any Vendor fails or refuses to collect the short-term rental tax
or to file a return or remit the tax or any portion thereof, as required by
this chapter, and the Vendor has not received confirmation that a Booking Agent
has collected and remitted the tax, the Administrator shall proceed in such
manner as he or she may deem best to obtain information on which to base an
assessment of the tax due. When the Administrator has obtained such information
as he or she is able, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against
such Vendor the tax and penalty provided for in this chapter.
   (b)    In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall serve
notice upon the Vendor of the amount so assessed, either by personal service,
by registered or certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code, to the address provided to the
Village by the Vendor, or if no such address is provided, to the property tax
mailing address for the property on file with the County Fiscal Officer. If
delivery is not made due to an undeliverable address or refusal of service, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mailand be considered served. Such Vendor
may, within thirty (30) days after the serving or mailing of such notice, apply
in writing to the Administrator for a hearing on the correctness of the amount
assessed. If the Vendor does not apply within the time prescribed, the tax and
penalty determined by the Administrator shall become final and conclusive and
due and payable. If the Vendor makes timely application, the Administrator
shall give the Vendor written notice not less than five (5) days in advance in
the manner prescribed in this section, to show cause at a time and place fixed
in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax
and penalty. At any such hearing, the Vendor may appear and offer evidence why
such specified tax and penalty should not be so fixed.
   (c)    After such hearing, the Administrator shall determine the proper
amount of tax due and shall thereafter give written notice to the Vendor, in
the manner prescribed in this section, of such determination and the amount of
such tax and penalty. The amount determined to be due shall be payable within
fifteen (15) days from the date of the Administrator's determination.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.10 APPEALS.
   Appeals from any ruling or determination of the Administrator with respect
to the amount of such tax and penalty shall be made to the Village Board of Tax
Review in conformance with Section 181.21 of the Village's Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 18-2019. Passed 9-9-19.)
185.11 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid under the provisions of this chapter shall be
deemed a debt owed by the Transient Guest to the Village. Any such tax not
collected by a Vendor, or a Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor, pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter, or any tax paid by a Transient Guest to a
Vendor, or a Booking Agent collecting for a Vendor, not paid to the Village
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed a debt owed by the

shall apply for the calendar year next following the July of the year in which

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the

a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval
fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio
R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the
towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice required under
Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either
of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC

   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   Every such prohibited sign, signal, marking or device is a public nuisance,
and the Police Chief is authorized to remove it or cause it to be removed.

      (6)    The failure to respond to a notice of liability in a timely
fashion as set forth in this ordinance shall constitute a waiver of the right
to contest liability for the violation under Section
 319.05 of this Chapter.
      (7)    Persons who choose to pay the civil penalty without appearing
before the Stow Municipal Court as set forth in Codified Ordinance Section
319.07 may do so in the manner indicated on the notice of liability.
      (8)    A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this

offenses and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner or operator
of the motor vehicle and shall not be reported to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles,

         (Ord. 07-2023. Passed 4-11-23.)
319.07  CONTESTING TICKETS.
   (a)    When a person or entity named in a Ticket for a civil violation
elects to contest a Ticket, the person or entity shall request a hearing in the
Stow Municipal Court by completing and filing the appeal form provided by the
Stow Municipal Court, within the time frame required.
   (b)    The Stow Municipal Court shall set the matter for a hearing not
sooner than twenty-one (21) days, but not later than forty-five (45), after the
filing of the request for hearing. The Prosecuting Attorney shall litigate the
case to a conclusion. The Court may extend the time period in which a hearing
must be conducted upon its own motion, or either a request for additional time
or waiver of time limits by the person or entity who requested the hearing.
Notice of the hearing shall be provided by the Stow Municipal Court. The Stow
Municipal Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the evidence
establishes that a Traffic Law Violation alleged in the Ticket did in fact
occur and whether the person or entity requesting the hearing is the person who
was operating the vehicle at the time of the Traffic Law Violation.
   (c)   (1)    If the Stow Municipal Court finds that the person or entity
named in the Ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation or receives evidence identifying a Designated Party, the
Court shall provide to Village or its designee, a copy of any evidence
substantiating the identity of the Designated Party.
      (2)    Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the Designated Party,
the Village or its designee may issue a Ticket to the Designated Party. The
Village shall ensure that a Ticket issued under this section conforms with
Section
319.04. The Village or its designee shall send the Ticket by ordinary mail not
later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the evidence from the Court of
the identity of the Designated Party.
   (d)    If a Designated Party, who is issued a Ticket under Section
319.04, contests the Ticket by filing a written request for a hearing and does
so not later than thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the Ticket, the
Registered Owner of the motor vehicle shall also attend the hearing. If at the
hearing involving the Designated Party the Stow Municipal Court cannot
determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the Registered Owner shall be liable for the violation. The Stow
Municipal Court shall then issue a written decision imposing liability for the
violation on the Registered Owner and submit it to Village or its designee and
to the Registered Owner. If the Designated Party, also is a Registered Owner of
the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the order of Registered
Owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (e)   (1)    The Stow Municipal Court shall determine whether a
preponderance of evidence establishes that a Traffic Law Violation occurred and
the person requesting the hearing is the party operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation.
         (i)    If the Stow Municipal Court finds by a preponderance of the
evidence that the alleged Traffic Law Violation did in fact occur and that the
person or entity named in the notice of liability is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall
issue a journal entry imposing liability for the violation upon the individual
or entity and submit it to the Village of Peninsula or its designee and the
person or entity named in the notice of liability.
         (ii)    If the Stow Municipal Court finds by a preponderance of the
evidence that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact
occur but the person or entity named in the notice of liability is not the
person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the Stow
Municipal Court shall issue a journal entry finding that the individual or
entity is not liable for the violation and submit it to the Village of
Peninsula or its designee and the person or entity named in the notice of
liability.
         (iii)    If the person who requested the hearing or a representative
of the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the
Stow Municipal Court shall determine that the person or entity is liable for
the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a journal entry
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the Village of Peninsula or its designee and the person or entity named
in the notice of liability.
   (f)    If the registered owner or designated party chooses to contest the
notice of liability, the Stow Municipal Court may consider any of the following
as an affirmative defense to a violation upon the defense being established by
a preponderance of the evidence by the registered owner or responsible party:
      (1)    That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and were not under control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation. In order to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen before the
traffic law violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation, the owner must
submit proof that a police report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed prior to the traffic law violation or within forty-eight (48)
hours after the traffic law violation occurred.
      (2)    That the motor vehicle was under the custody and/or control of
another person at the time of the violation. In order to establish this, the
owner or responsible person must provide the name and address of the person who
had custody and/or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law
violation.
      (3)    That this section is unenforceable because the recorded image is
not legible enough to determine the information needed.
      (4)    Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to Section
 319.07(e)(l), that the registered owner or person named in the notice of
liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. To
satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the owner or person named
in the notice of liability shall provide to the Stow Municipal Court evidence
showing the identity of the person who was operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the traffic law violation, including, but not limited to, the
operator's name and current address, and any other evidence the Stow Municipal
Court deems pertinent.
      (5)    That the motor vehicle operator was yielding the right-of-way to
an emergency vehicle in accordance with Ohio law, or to a funeral procession.
      (6)    That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to yield
the right-of-way to either of the following: (i) a public safety vehicle or
coroner's vehicle in accordance with section 4511.45 of the Ohio Revised Code;
or (ii) a funeral procession in accordance with Section 4511.451 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (7)    At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
      (8)    That under consideration of the totality of the circumstances the
person or entity named in the notice of liability is not liable.
   (g)    If the Stow Municipal Court finds that the person or entity named in
the notice of liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence under Section
319.07(e)(4) identifying the designated party, the Stow Municipal Court shall
provide it to the Village of Peninsula or its designee, along with a copy of
any evidence substantiating who was operating the motor vehicle at the time of
the traffic law violation.
      (1)    Upon receipt of evidence of the responsible party pursuant to this
Section or pursuant to Section
319.06(b), the Village of Peninsula or its designee may issue a notice of
liability, with the name and address of the designated party and the
information required by Section
319.04 of this Chapter, to the person that the evidence indicates was operating
the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
      (2)    A notice of liability issued under this Section
 319.07(g), shall be sent by the Village of Peninsula or its designee by
ordinary mail no later than twenty-one (21) business days after the receipt of
the evidence from the Stow Municipal Court. The content of a notice of
liability issued under this subsection shall be the same as set forth in
division (a) of Section
319.04 of this Chapter.
      (3)    If a designated party who was issued a notice of liability under
Section
319.07 (e) hereof contests the ticket by filing a written request for an appeal
hearing not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of
liability, the registered owner of the motor vehicle shall also attend the
hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party the hearing officer
cannot determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the registered owner is liable for the violation. The hearing
officer then may issue a written decision imposing liability for the violation
on the registered owner and submit it to the Village or its designee and to the
registered owner. If the designated party also is a registered owner of the
vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the order of registered
owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (h)    A person who is named in a notice of liability for a civil violation
may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with division (D) of Section
2317.02 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (i)    A person or entity found liable for a Ticket may appeal the decision
rendered by the Stow Municipal Court in accordance with Ohio law.
   (j)    No decision rendered under this Section, and no admission of
liability under this Chapter is admissible as evidence in any other judicial
proceeding in this state, except as is provided in Section 319.10 hereinbelow.
(Ord. 07-2023. Passed 4-11-23.)
319.08 CALIBRATION.
   (a)    Upon request, each manufacturer of an Officer-Operated Traffic Law

Device used by the Village shall provide to the Village a certificate of proper
operation that attests to the accuracy of the device.
(Ord. 07-2023. Passed 4-11-23.)
319.09 COLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTY.
   (a)    In the event that the Registered Owner or Designated Party fails to
take any action set forth in Section
319.05 or fails to satisfy any liability determined by the Stow Municipal Court
for the penalties established under this Chapter and the time to appeal such
decision has passed without the filing of an appeal, the Village may seek to
collect the amount due and owing and/or may initiate a civil enforcement action
in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain a judgment for the civil penalty
and any late fees, costs and attorney's fees that may be imposed under this
Chapter and by the Stow Municipal Court.
   (b)    If a judgment for a civil penalty under this Chapter is not
satisfied, the Village may seek payment on the judgment amount, together with
any applicable interest and cost thereon, in any manner authorized by law. In
addition to any other fees or charges authorized by this Chapter in relation to
the commission of a Traffic Law Violation thereof, a person liable for the

direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for
traffic approaching from the opposite direction before coming within 200 feet

auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.

vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
Section
331.05, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.

section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

lanes for traffic or wherever traffic is lawfully moving in two or more
substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules
apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting
the use of a particular lane to only buses during certain hours or during all

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two
or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)
of this section has occurred, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the
offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section
if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in

this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, whoever

Ohio R.C. 2705.02.
      (2)   A.   If, within three years of a violation of subsection (a)(1),
(2) or (3) of this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or
been convicted of two or more violations of division (A)(1), (2) or (3) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
         B.   Whoever violates subsection (a)(4) or (5) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (3)   For any violation of this section, in addition to the penalties

section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. The
proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the
immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization ordered
unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil action
that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at
the time of a violation of this section, the vehicle is registered in the

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be sentenced to a jail
term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division (A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a
misdemeanor of the first degree. (ORC 4507.35)

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

of two violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

State.
   (e)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section shall
be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable. The

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

      (1)   Every motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, when operated upon a
street or highway, shall be equipped with brakes adequate to control the
movement of and to stop and hold such motor vehicle, including two separate
means of applying the brakes, each of which means shall be effective to apply
the brakes to at least two wheels. If these two separate means of applying the
brakes are connected in any way, then on such motor vehicles manufactured or
assembled after January 1, 1942, they shall be so constructed that failure of
any one part of the operating mechanism shall not leave the motor vehicle
without brakes on at least two wheels.
      (2)   Every motorcycle, when operated upon a street or highway, shall be
equipped with at least one adequate brake, which may be operated by hand or by
foot.
      (3)   Every motorized bicycle shall be equipped with brakes meeting the
rules adopted by the Ohio Director of Public Safety under Ohio R.C. 4511.521.

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
 
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
 
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the
witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)
541.02 ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or
if the property involved in a violation is an occupied aircraft, criminal

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

Ohio R.C. 4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license
registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

741.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)    This Chapter is intended to protect and promote the health, safety,
and general welfare of all of the citizens of Village of Peninsula and preserve
the small-town character of the Village by requiring the registration and
certification of short-term rentals within the Village. It is also the intent
of this chapter to protect the integrity of the residential neighborhoods while
allowing property owners to receive remuneration from renting a dwelling or
portions of a dwelling to help maintain the dwelling.
   (b)    Short-term rentals shall be limited as set forth in this chapter in
the R-1 Rural Residential District, R-2 "Small Town" Residential District, the
C Commercial District, and the MU Mixed Use District within the Village. The
purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit short term rentals in order
to:
      (1)    Establish minimum standards and conditions for Short-term Home
rentals and Owner-occupied Short-term rentals that reflect the goals and
policies of the Long Range Plan and the Planning and Zoning Code;
      (2)    Reinforce the purpose of the R-1 Rural Residential District by
retaining a
rural living environment in the district, maintaining suitable neighborhoods
for families and children, and discouraging uses that would generate traffic on
local streets in excess of normal traffic generated by the neighborhood; and
      (3)    Acknowledge that the R-2 "Small Town" Residential District is
intended to be more eclectic in its design, character, and size of housing,
resulting in varied neighborhoods in close proximity to commercial and tourist
attractions, while controlling the density of short-term rentals, preventing
congestion on public streets, and reducing hazards to life and property.

1101.01 TITLE.
      This Zoning Ordinance, comprising all of these requirements, regulations,
procedures, and map, shall be known, cited, and referred to as the Village
Zoning Ordinance, which shall be abbreviated herein as "this Ordinance". This
Ordinance shall replace, in its entirety, Ordinance 2005-0711-03, As Amended
(Zoning Ordinance).
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1101.02 PURPOSE.
   The Village of Peninsula is a small community with a rich history of
agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, and tourism
related uses. It is essential that all use areas be given adequate protection,
that agricultural uses may continue to coexist with residential uses, and that
residential areas may develop in an orderly manner. It is essential that
commercial uses have an equal degree of protection to promote and preserve the
Main Street and nearby shopping areas and provide adequate off-street parking
facilities which will tend to keep customers coming to said shopping areas. It
is also recognized that the purpose of industry and commerce is to provide the
means for a decent and respectable life for the citizens of a community. With
regard to the interests of public health, safety, convenience, prosperity, and
general welfare, it is essential that residential areas be suitably located in
relationship to industry and commerce, and that they be protected against the
intrusions which will interfere with decent living conditions. It is essential
that all of the uses of land and buildings within the Village be so related as
to provide for economy in government in such a manner that they may mutually
support each other and each derive the greatest benefit from industry,
commercial, and residential areas.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1101.03  APPLICATION.
      The provisions of this Ordinance shall be considered as the minimum
requirements necessary for the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
prosperity, and general welfare.
Whenever the requirements of this Ordinance are at variance with a statute or
lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions or
covenants, the more restrictive requirement shall govern. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed

1115.01  HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   Purpose and Intent. In order to promote the economic and general welfare of
the people of the Village of Peninsula and of the public generally and ensure
the harmonious, orderly, and efficient growth and development of the
municipality; it is deemed essential by the Village Council that the qualities
relating to the history of the Village and a harmonious outward appearance of
structures which preserve property values and attract tourists and residents
alike be preserved. Qualities related to the above-stated purpose include: the
continued existence and preservation of historic areas and buildings; the
continued construction of buildings in historic styles; and a general harmony
as to style, form, proportion, texture, and material between buildings of
historic design and those of more modern design. Such purpose is advanced
through the preservation and protection of the old historic or architecturally
worthy structures and quaint neighborhoods that impart a distinct aspect to the
Village and serve as visible reminders of the historical and cultural heritage
of the Village, the State, and the nation.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1115.02 HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT DEFINED.
   The Historic Preservation Overlay District shall have the boundary as
outlined in Exhibit A attached to this Chapter. As an overlay district, it
shall not restrict any uses or requirements of the underlying zoning district
but shall establish requirements in addition to the district regulations
relating to building and site changes.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)

         B.   Hear requests for and approve or deny the demolition of
buildings, structures, or parts of buildings or structures in the Historic
Preservation Overlay District.
      (2)    In order to obtain necessary technical assistance, the Historic
Preservation Overlay Review Board shall be authorized to retain Architects,
Engineers, Historians, or other professionals to assist with and provide
guidance in the decision-making process of the Board. When the Board determines
expert advice is necessary to evaluate a proposed application relative to the
requirements of this ordinance, the Board shall advise the applicant that such
assistance is required. Fees for such outside consultants and all
administrative and legal costs pertaining to the review and processing of any
application shall be collected in advance of any reviews, inspections, or
issuance of any permits or approvals.
            (3)    Interpretation. The Board shall have the power to interpret
the design criteria as outlined in the Chapter for the district. The
interpretation of the Board, as it relates to the design criteria, shall be
final. Where questions occur as to the location of any boundary line of a
Historic Preservation Overlay District, the Board shall interpret the map in
such a way as to carry out the purpose and intent of this chapter.

1115.05 HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT PROCEDURES FOR ISSUANCE OF A
CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS BY THE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY REVIEW
BOARD.
   (a)    An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made on
a form provided by the Zoning Officer. New construction and major additions or
alterations and/or demolitions shall be reviewed by the Historic Preservation
Overlay Review Board. The Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall meet
as necessary on the dates of regularly scheduled Planning Commission Meetings
to review applications that have been received by the Village at least ten
working days prior to each regularly scheduled meeting. The Chairperson may
call additional meetings from time to time on dates other than regularly
scheduled Planning Commission meeting dates. The applicant shall be informed of
the time and place at which the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board will
consider the application, and the applicant shall be permitted to be heard at
that meeting.
   (b)    An application for a certificate of appropriateness is not considered
complete until all illustrative material necessary to adequately describe the
proposed project has been submitted. The Historic Preservation Overlay Review
Board may refuse to consider an application for a certificate of
appropriateness if it determines that insufficient information has been
provided by the applicant.
   (c)   Every application or review involving new construction of buildings
and other site improvements or major alterations or additions to existing
structures in the Historic Preservation Overlay District falling within the
scope of this ordinance shall be accompanied by drawings of the proposed
structures, site improvements, or alterations. Such drawings shall comply with
the standards of Section
1149.04 of this Zoning Code. In addition, such plans shall be accompanied by
samples of materials for review and clarification. Such documents shall be
filed with the Village, in sufficient number for the Historic Preservation
Overlay Review Board, with the appropriate fees and deposit, if required.
   (d)    Prior to either the preparation of working drawings and
specifications or calling for proposals or bids from contractors, applicants
are encouraged to prepare preliminary scale drawings and outline
specifications, including samples, for review and informal discussion with the
Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board. The purpose of this review shall be
to identify any inconsistencies between the proposed work and the design
guidelines and allow for discussion of alternate treatments.
   (e)   In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall follow the following
procedures and criteria.
      (1)   The Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall state the
basis for its determination and evaluate whether:
         A.   The building, structure, appurtenance, or site will be properly
preserved.
         B.   The proposed work is consistent with the historic and
architectural character of the building, structure, appurtenance, or site and
complies with the standards established by Section 6.
         C.   The project will have a negative impact on the historical or
architectural character of the property or site.
      (2)   If the structure does not receive a positive review from the
Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board, then a certificate of
appropriateness shall not be issued, unless:
         A.   The proposed alterations are necessary for the continued
viability of the structure, and the costs of making the improvements in such a
manner to meet the above findings render the building incapable of earning an
economic return upon its value at the time or upon future sale of the property.
         B.   The proposed project is required for the physical functioning of
the building or health or safety reasons, with no reasonable alternative
available.
         C.   If the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board finds that
either of the latter two circumstances exists, every effort shall be made to
minimize the adverse impact of the work and allow for the work to be reversed
in the future.
      (3)   Requests for approval of demolition shall follow the procedures
established in Section 7.
   (f)   In reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the
Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall not consider interior
arrangements, detailed designs, or features not subject to public view and/or
view from surrounding properties. The Board shall not impose any requirements
except for the purpose of preventing developments that are architecturally
incompatible with the historic aspects of the Historic Preservation Overlay
District.
   (g)   If the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board approves an
application, it shall issue a certificate of appropriateness which shall be
signed by the Chairperson or Vice Chairperson and be attached to the
application and transferred to the office of the Zoning Officer. All prints
approved by the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall be stamped
accordingly. The Zoning Officer shall thereupon process the application in the
usual manner.
    (h)    If the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board disapproves such
plans, it shall state its reason for doing so and transmit a record of such
action and reason to the Zoning Officer and the applicant. At that point, no
further action shall be taken by the Zoning Officer on the application. The
applicant may modify the application to make it acceptable to the Zoning
Officer or Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board and shall have the right
to resubmit the application at any time. In the alternative, the applicant may
appeal the decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The appeal shall be filed
on the appropriate forms within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision of
the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board.
   (i)   The Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall act within 60
days of receipt of a complete application. The failure of the Historic
Preservation Overlay Review Board to approve or disapprove such application
within such time, unless mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the Historic
Preservation Overlay Review Board, shall be deemed to constitute approval, and
the Zoning Officer shall thereupon process the application without regard to
the certificate of appropriateness.
   (j)   After the permit has been processed by the Zoning Officer in
accordance with these procedures, the project shall, from time to time, be
inspected in the field to review the construction, reconstruction, alteration,
maintenance, or repair. Necessary action shall be taken to assure compliance
with the approved application.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1115.06 HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   The United States Secretary of the Interior Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties may be used as a guide to assist the Historic Preservation
Overlay Review Board in the issuance of certificates of appropriateness.
   (a)   General Standards.
      (1)   Building proportion (height, depth, and width) for new construction
shall be such that it is similar to any immediately adjacent structures on the
same street, or streets of a corner lot. Any exterior modifications or
additions to existing structures shall maintain the proportions of wall height
and length, window and door opening sizes, and roof height and slope as the
original structure. New principal structures shall conform in these regards to
the proportions of adjoining structures. All existing and new principal
structures shall maintain a rhythm of the masses to openings.
      (2)   Materials utilized in exterior renovations, additions, and
construction of new principal structures shall either match the appearance of
the materials used in construction of the original buildings or shall be modern
construction materials which create the same effect. Such materials shall not
be a cosmetic treatment which simulates original fabric.
      (3)   All exterior colors shall be appropriate to the architectural style
and time period in which the structure was built. Visual relationships of the
streetscape shall be maintained.
      (4)   Decorative detail items of new construction or major additions or
alterations such as chimneys, gutters, downspouts, gables, soffits, hardware,
light fixtures, and shutters shall be compatible with the architectural style
of the principal structure. Materials used for and design of decorative details
may be modern reproductions, which create the same effect.
      (5)   Techniques utilized in the rehabilitation of existing exterior
surfaces shall be sympathetic to the surface materials.
   (b)   Standards for Major Additions or Alterations.
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to use the property for its
originally intended purpose or to provide a compatible use requiring minimal
alteration.
      (2)   Each property shall be recognized as a product of its own time.
Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier
appearance shall be discouraged.
      (3)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced whenever possible, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence.
      (4)   The gentlest means possible shall be used to clean the property's
surface if necessary. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage
the historic building material are prohibited unless specifically approved by
the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board.
      (5)   Archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any alteration
shall be protected and preserved.
      (6)   Contemporary design for alteration to a property shall not be
discouraged when such alteration does not destroy significant, historical,
architectural, or cultural material and character of the property, its
environment, and surrounding contributing properties.
      (7)   Whenever possible, a new major addition or alteration shall be
accomplished so that its future removal will not impair the essential form and
integrity of the structure.
      (8)   Materials utilized in exterior renovations and additions to the
principal structures shall either match the appearance of that used in
construction of the original buildings or shall be modern construction
materials which create the same effect. The materials shall not be a cosmetic
treatment which simulates original fabric. Decorative detail items such as
chimneys, gutters, downspouts, gables, soffits, hardware, light fixtures,
signs, and shutters shall be compatible with the architectural style of the
principal structure.
      (9)   In passing upon appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Overlay
Review Board shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factor, the
architectural characteristics typical of structures in the District; and the
historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style,
general design, arrangement, texture, material, and color of the architectural
feature involved and its relation to the architectural features of other
contributing properties in the immediate neighborhood.
   (c)   Standards for New Construction.
      (1)   New structures should look new, but relate to existing contributing
properties surrounding the new structure. Building height, width, mass, and
proportion affect the degree of compatibility between the old and the new.
      (2)   Physical size and scale shall be compatible to existing
contributing properties without overwhelming them.
      (3)   The proportion of openings, width, and height of windows, doors,
and entries, shall be visually compatible with adjacent contributing properties
and open space.
      (4)   The rhythm or relationship of solid spaces to voids (i.e., walls to
windows and doors) in the facade of a structure shall be visually compatible
with adjacent contributing properties and open spaces in its environment.
       (5)   The rhythm of spacing, the relationship of a structure to the open
space between it and adjoining structures, shall respect the surrounding
environment.
      (6)   The rhythm of projections, the relationship of entrances, porches,
and other projections to sidewalks or streets, shall be guided by the
streetscape provided by adjacent and visually related structures and open
spaces.
      (7)   The choice of material, texture, and color for the facade of the
structure should relate attractively to and be tempered by the predominant
material, texture, and color of adjacent and visually related structures.
      (8)   Preservation and allocation of appropriate green spaces shall be
encouraged and respective of the rhythm or relationship of solid spaces to
voids.
      (9)   The scale, size, and mass of structures in relation to open spaces,
openings, and projections shall be compatible with adjacent, visually related
structures and open spaces.
      (10)   A structure that has frontage on more than one street or alley
resulting in multiple facades shall require application of compatibility
standards to each facade.
      (11)   The Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board shall consider, in
addition to any other pertinent factor, the architectural characteristics
typical of structures in the district and the historical and architectural
value and significance, architectural style, general design, arrangement,
texture, material, and color of the architectural feature involved and its
relation to the architectural features of other structures in the immediate
neighborhood.
         (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1115.07  HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT DEMOLITION AND MOVING OF
STRUCTURES.
   (a)    The demolition of all or part of a designated historic structure or
of an existing building within a designated Historic Preservation Overlay
District shall require the approval of the Historic Preservation Overlay Review
Board, in accordance with the following procedures, upon application by a
property owner.
   (b)   The Historic Review Board shall then have up to 60 days from the date
of the referral to determine whether the structure is historically significant.
The Historic Review Board may engage the assistance of organizations with
expertise in this area to assist it in making its determination.
   (c)   If the Planning Commission finds that the structure or part of the
structure requested to be demolished is not historically significant, and the
demolition will not adversely affect the character of the area, including the
appearance of the streetscape in terms of the overall scale, rhythm, design, or
unity, then a Certificate of Appropriateness may be issued and the demolition
permit may be granted.
   (d)    In the event the Planning Commission finds the structure is
historically significant, the Planning Commission may issue a determination
that the demolition of the structure be delayed for up to an additional 180
days, or a longer period with the agreement of the property owner, to permit
the exploration of preservation alternatives, such as: designating the
structure as a historic landmark, finding a purchaser who may be interested in
rehabilitating the structure, raising money to rehabilitate the structure, or
finding alternate sites for the proposed post-demolition project.
   (e)    In making its determination that the structure is historically
significant, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   The structure's architectural and design significance;
      (2)   Whether the building is one of the last remaining examples of its
kind in the neighborhood, Village, or region;
      (3)   Whether the structure has historical events or persons associated
with it, and
      (4)   The condition of the structure.
   (f)   The structure may be demolished at any time within or after the
additional 180-day period specified in paragraph (d) hereof if the Planning
Commission determines that, despite the structure's historical significance,
there are no feasible alternatives to demolition. Factors to be considered in
making a no feasible alternatives determination are the following:
      (1)   Realistic alternatives (including adaptive uses) are not likely
because of the nature or cost of the work necessary to preserve the structure;
      (2)   After a bona fide, reasonable effort, a purchaser for the structure
or rehabilitation solution that will result in the preservation,
rehabilitation, or restoration of the structure cannot be found;
      (3)   Economic hardship on the part of the property owner, making
delaying the demolition request unreasonable;
      (4)   The property is an imminent and substantial danger to the health
and/or safety of the public due to its deteriorating condition;
      (5)   The structure has been burned or damaged by an event beyond the
property owner's control with more than 50% of the structure affected;
      (6)   The applicant has submitted a rescue plan that mitigates any
adverse effects of the proposed removal upon the property, the streetscape, and
the historic district through:
         A.   New construction that is consistent with the design standards and
which contributes to the architectural or historic integrity of the historic
district;
         B.   Exterior rehabilitation or restoration of the remaining structure
that is consistent with the architectural design standards and which
contributes to the architectural or historic integrity of the streetscape;
         C.   Landscaping the parcel consistent with the design standards,
providing for its care as common space for the benefit of the general public
and relocating the remaining structure in an appropriate setting or preserving
of the salvageable architectural materials.
   (g)    As an alternative to demolition which has been approved pursuant to
this section, the Historic Preservation Overlay Review Board may approve the
moving of an existing building where:
      (1)   The new surroundings would be harmonious with the historical and
architectural character of the building; and
      (2)   The relocation would help preserve and protect a building of
historical interest. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
  1115.08 HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT PROTECTIVE MAINTENANCE
REQUIRED; EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
   All contributing buildings and structures in the Historic Preservation
Overlay District shall be properly maintained and repaired at the same level
required elsewhere in the Village. Should an owner deliberately omit essential
maintenance and repairs, which would eventually result in the building becoming
so run down that it would be constitutionally unreasonable for the Village to
refuse to allow the owner to demolish the building, the Historic Preservation
Overlay Review Board shall bring this matter to the attention of the Zoning
Officer, who shall immediately require of the owner or agent to undertake
protective maintenance and repair to further the economic, health, safety, and
general welfare of the Village. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
prevent ordinary maintenance or repairs of any structures.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1115.09 FEES.
   All applications for certificates of appropriateness and appeals shall be
accompanied by the following fees:
   Certificate of Appropriateness: $25
   Deposit for Technical Assistance: As determined by the Historic Preservation
Overlay Review Board. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)

upon which building actual construction has been diligently carried on, and
provided, further, that such building was completed within two years from the
date of passage and publication of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1117.03 BUILDING GRADES.
   Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that
a sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of surface water to run
away from the walls of the building. A sloping grade, beginning at the sidewalk
level, shall be maintained and established from the center of the front lot
line to the finished grade line at the front of the building, and from the rear
wall of the building to the rear lot line; however, that shall not prevent the
grading of a yard space to provide sunken or terraced areas, provided proper
means are constructed and maintained to prevent the runoff of surface water to
flow onto the adjoining properties. When a new building is constructed on a
vacant lot between the existing buildings or adjacent to an existing building,
the existing established grade shall be considered in determining the grade
around the new building, and the yard around the new building shall be graded
in such a manner as to meet existing grades and not to permit runoff of surface
water to flow onto the adjacent properties. Grades shall be approved by the
Street Commissioner or his designee.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1117.04  BUILDING TO BE MOVED.
   Any building or structure, which has been wholly or partially erected on any
property, shall not be moved to and be placed upon any other property in this
Village until a permit to use such building or structure, after being moved,
shall have been secured under this Ordinance. Any such building or structure
shall fully conform to all the provisions of this Ordinance, in the same manner
as a new building or structure. Before a permit may be issued for moving a
building or structure, the Zoning Officer shall inspect same and shall
determine if it is in a safe condition to be moved, whether it may be
reconditioned to comply with the Building Code and other Village requirements
for the use and occupancy for which it is to be used and whether it will be of
similar character with the buildings in the area where it is to be moved.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1117.05 LOCATION OF BUILDINGS.
   Except where otherwise provided for in this Ordinance, every dwelling shall
be located on a lot abutting upon a street or permanent easement of access to a

access shall have a width throughout of not less than twenty feet. In addition,
adequate space shall be provided for emergency vehicle access to all buildings.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1117.06  NO IMPLIED RIGHT OF COMPLETION.
   The construction of a building or structure to a less height, area, or bulk
than originally planned, prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, does
not entitle its owner to later construct such building or structure to its full
height, area and bulk. Any such building or structure shall be treated no
differently than any other building or structure and shall conform to all
provisions of this Ordinance applicable thereto.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)

1117.09 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS IN RESIDENCE DISTRICTS.
   (a)   An attached accessory building, including a carport attached to a
principal building, on a lot, shall be made structurally a part thereof, and
shall comply in all respects with the requirements of this Ordinance applicable
to the principal building. Breezeways, for the purpose of this Ordinance, as an
attachment between the garage or carport and the main building, shall be
considered as part of the main building, but breezeways shall not be considered
as constituting livable floor area.
   
   (b)   An accessory building and garage unless attached and made a part of
the principal building on a lot as above provided shall not be nearer than 10
feet to the principal building.
   (c)   A detached accessory building or garage shall not exceed one story or

as part of a side yard, rear yard, front yard, or other open space required by
this Ordinance may, by reason of change in ownership or otherwise, be counted
or calculated to satisfy or comply with a yard or other open space requirement
of or for any other building. The minimum yards or other open spaces, including
lot area per family or percentage of lot coverage required by this Ordinance
for each and every building existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance
or for any building hereafter erected, shall not be encroached upon or
considered as yard or open space requirements for any other building. (Ord. 21-
2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1117.12  FENCES, WALLS AND HEDGES.
   (a)    In any residential district, no fence or portion thereof shall exist

1125.01  INTENT.
   The intent of this chapter is to provide for adequate private passenger
vehicle and delivery truck parking for different types of land uses within the
Village and to set standards for the construction and use of off-street parking
facilities. Within this chapter, standards have been identified for:
   (a)    The temporary parking of trucks with the primary intent of delivering
goods for storage and/or sale to the general public;
   (b)    The temporary parking of private passenger vehicles as a use incident
to a principal use; and
   (c)    The temporary parking of private passenger vehicles as a principal
use of the site to serve another use district which has developed without
adequate off-street parking. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1125.02  OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACE.
   On the same premises with every building, structure, or part thereof,
erected and occupied within the C Commercial District and the MU Mixed Use
District there shall be provided and maintained on the lot, adequate space for
standing, loading and unloading services in order to avoid undue interference
with public use of the streets or alleys. Such space shall include a ten foot
by fifty-five-foot loading space, with fourteen foot height clearance, for
every 10,000 square feet or fraction thereof, in excess of 2,000 square feet of
building floor use or land use for the above-mentioned purposes. A ten foot by
twenty-five-foot loading space with a fourteen-foot height clearance shall be
required for non-residential uses of 2,000 or less square feet of building
floor use or land use. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1125.03 OFF-STREET PARKING DEVELOPMENT CONDITIONS.
    In all zoning districts, off-street parking facilities for the storage or
parking of private passenger vehicles hereafter erected, altered or extended
after the effective date of this Ordinance
shall be provided and maintained as herein prescribed:
      (a)    The loading space as required in Section
1125.02 shall not be construed as supplying any off-street parking space.
      (b)    When units or measurements used in determining the number of
required parking spaces result in requirement of fractional space, any fraction
up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half
shall require one space.
      (c)    Whenever a use requiring off-street parking is increased in floor
area or changed in use, and such use is located in a building existing on or
before the effective date of this Ordinance, additional parking space for such
additional floor area or changed use shall be provided and maintained in
amounts hereafter specified for such use; provided, however, in the existing
business districts where the Village and various property owners have or may
cooperatively develop parking facilities, and additional parking space as
required for the increased floor space is not available within the required 300
feet as required in this Ordinance, the Commission may, through negotiations
with the owner of such property, vary the location of such required parking
spaces or agree to the owner's participation in other authorized parking
facilities which will furnish the same amount of space as required for his
increased floor space within a distance of not more than 500 feet of the
building.
      (d)    For the purpose of this chapter, "floor area" in the case of
offices, merchandising or service types of use, shall mean the gross floor area
used or intended to be used for services to the public as customers, patrons,
clients or patients or as tenants, including areas occupied for fixtures and
equipment used for display or sale of merchandise.
      (e)   Off-street parking facilities for one- and two-family dwellings
shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building they are
intended to serve. The location of required off-street parking facilities for
other than one and two-family dwellings and all multiple dwellings shall be
within 500 feet of the building they are intended to serve, measured from the
nearest point of the off-street parking facilities to the nearest point of the
building.
      (f)    In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirements
for off-street parking facilities for a use which is mentioned and which such
use is similar shall apply.
      (g)    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent collective
provision of off- street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses,
provided that, collectively, such facilities shall not be less than the sum of
the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in
accordance with the table in this chapter.
      (h)    Nothing in this section shall prevent the extension of or an
addition to a building into an existing parking area which is required for the
original building when the same amount of space taken by the extension or
addition to a building is provided by an enlargement of the existing parking
lot or an additional area within 300 feet of such building.
      (i)    Such parking areas will be used solely for the parking of private
passenger vehicles for periods of less than twenty-four hours (excluding
parking devoted entirely to single family detached, two family or three family
dwellings) and shall not be used as off-street loading areas.
      (j)    No commercial repair work or service of any kind, or sales or
display activities, shall be conducted in such parking areas.
     (k)    Such parking lots shall be used only for parking automobiles and no
commercial activities, such as washing or greasing, sale of merchandise or
purveying of foodstuffs, repair work or servicing of any kind shall be done
thereon.
      (l)    No building or structure shall be hereafter built or permitted,
except as necessary buildings for an attendant, not more than fifty square feet
each in area and not more than fifteen feet in height.
      (m)    Plans for development of any such parking lot must be approved by
the Zoning Officer before construction is started. No such land shall be used
for parking until approved by the Administrative Official.
      (n)    Any area once designated as required off-street parking shall not
be changed to any other use unless and until equal facilities are provided
elsewhere.
      (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)

1125.05 MUNICIPAL FACILITIES.
   Wherever the Council establishes off-street parking facilities by means of a
special assessment district or by any other means, the Council may determine,
upon completion and acceptance of such off-street parking facilities by the
Council, all existing buildings or uses and all buildings erected or uses
established thereafter within the special assessment district or districts
shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter for privately supplied
off-street parking facilities. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1125.06 REGULATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PARKING LOTS.
   In all districts where off-street parking lots are the principal use of a
site or are permitted as an adjunct to the lawful use of property therein, and
such facilities provide parking privileges to owners, occupants, tenants,
employees, patrons, customers, members, visitors, and invitees therein, such
off-street parking lots shall be constructed and maintained subject to the
following regulations:
   (a)    Application Requirements.  An application for a permit to construct
such a lot shall be submitted to the Village. After the Administrative Official
has determined that the following mandatory provisions have been provided for,
a permit shall be issued to the applicant. The application shall include a site
plan along with all applicable construction details and elevations and shall
include all items identified in this Section. All plans shall be prepared and
sealed by a registered engineer.
   (b)    Ingress/Egress. Adequate ingress and egress shall be provided to meet
the approval of the Administrative Official. Backing directly onto a street
shall be prohibited.
   (c)    Construction Requirements. All parking lots shall, at a minimum, be
surfaced and maintained with a durable and dustless surface (such as brick,
stone, gravel or slag, washed silica pebbles, asphalt or concrete). All parking
lots shall provide an adequate storm management system as approved by the
Planning Commission in consultation with the Village Engineer and/or Zoning
Officer.
   (d)    Lighting.  All lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking
area shall be so installed as to be confined within and directed onto only the
parking area and property which it serves. No lighting shall be so located or
visible as to be a hazard to traffic safety. Minimum light levels at any one
location within the lots shall be one foot-candle, and maximum light levels at
any point along the perimeter of the lot shall be one and one-half foot-
candles. A lighting plan shall be submitted along with the site plan identified
above and shall include all light locations, photometric diagrams and light
fixture details. In addition, all off-street parking areas shall be designed
and screened so as to minimize the presence of headlight glare on adjacent
properties, particularly those zoned or used for residential purposes.
      (e)    Lots Located Opposite Residential Property. All street boundaries
of such parking lots where residential property is located on the opposite side
of the street shall provide screening of vehicle headlights to the residential
property.
      (f)    Signs. No sign shall be erected upon such parking lots, except not
more than one sign at each entrance to indicate the operator, the purpose for
which operated and the parking rates, when charge is permitted. Such signs
shall not exceed six square feet in area per site entrance and shall not extend
more than eight feet in height above the nearest curb and shall be entirely
upon the parking lot.
      (g)    Drive Width. Entry driveways shall be at least 12 feet wide for
one-way travel and at least 24 feet wide for two-way travel.
      (h)    Layout Plan Requirements. Plans for the layout of off-street
parking facilities shall be in accordance with the following minimum
requirements:
 
 
Parking  Stall  Aisle  Stall
Angle    Width  Width  Length

      Facilities for the parking of tour busses, motorcoaches, and other large
vehicles shall be designed in accordance with and depending upon the type(s) of
vehicles proposing to be accommodated on a site.
   (i)    Parking for the Physically Handicapped.  Parking requirements for the
physically handicapped shall be in conformance with the Ohio Building Code.
   (j)    Maneuvering Lanes. All maneuvering lane widths shall permit one-way
traffic movement, except that the 90-degree pattern may permit two-way
movement.
   (k)    Other Driveway Standards. If abutting parking spaces are arranged at
an angle other than those listed above, the minimum driveway width shall be
determined according to the next higher standard from the table. For example,
if 75-degree angle parking is provided, the minimum driveway width shall be the
standards for 90-degree angle parking or twenty-four feet.
   (l)    Driveway Width for Driveways Used by Large Vehicles. If the driveway
is regularly used by trash collection vehicles, delivery trucks or other large
vehicles, the minimum width shall be increased to twenty-four feet.
   (m)    Other Improvements. Except for single- and two-family dwellings on
individual lots, where three or more unenclosed parking spaces are provided,
exclusive of driveways, the following additional improvements are required:
      (1)    Drainage.  Parking areas shall be appropriately graded and
equipped with facilities to collect and store stormwater on-site and transmit
it to the approved public facilities, as determined by the Village Engineer
and/or Zoning Officer.
      (2)    Marking.  All parking spaces shall be appropriately marked with
painted lines.
      (n)    Shared Parking and Access Facilities. In conjunction with
multiple-family or nonresidential uses, two or more adjoining properties may be
developed with shared parking and access facilities when approved under a
single unified site plan. In such cases, the setbacks, curbing and perimeter
landscaping requirement of this section shall not apply along the common
property line.
      (o)    Setback Requirements. The setbacks of all off-street parking lots
shall be in accordance with the requirements identified below:
            (1)    Front yard. No parking lot stalls or aisles shall be located
closer than five feet to the public road right-of-way. In addition, and
whenever possible, parking should be located behind building.
            (2)    Side yard on interior lot lines. No parking lot stalls or
aisles shall be located closer than ten feet to the adjoining parcel property
line of a residential use and must be screened in accordance with section (q)
herein. Parking lot stalls and aisles shall be permitted to abut the property
line of an adjacent non-residential use.
            (3)    Side yard on street side of corner lots.  No parking lot
stalls or aisles shall be located closer than five feet to a street right-of-
way.
            (4)    Rear yard. No parking lot stalls or aisles shall be located
closer than five feet to the rear property line of nonresidential uses. When a
parking lot is located adjacent to any residential use, the setback shall be
ten feet.
            (5)    Rear yard abutting a street.  No parking lot stall or aisle
shall be located closer than five feet to a street right-of-way.
   (p)    Landscape Screen Requirements.  When required, parking spaces and
parking areas shall be effectively screened with perimeter landscaping on all
sides adjacent to or visible from adjacent properties, streets or alleys. Any
parking area containing more than fifty spaces shall also include interior
landscaping to further reduce the visual impacts of the areas, to reduce their
heat radiation effects, to improve oxygen generation, and to reduce air
pollution.
            (1)    Installation/maintenance. Landscape screening shall be
installed and maintained as required in this Ordinance.
            (2)    Screening. Screening shall be provided for all non-
residential uses where three or more unenclosed parking spaces are provided
exclusive of driveways. Screening shall be provided in accordance with a
landscape plan submitted as part of the application and shall meet the design
standards identified in this Ordinance.
      (q)    Design Standards for Landscape Screen Requirements.
            (1)    Deciduous or evergreen shrubs used in a perimeter landscape
screen shall be at least two feet high at initial planting and shall be
expected and permitted to grow to a height of at least three feet within two
years of planting; such materials shall be expected and permitted to grow to a
height of five feet.
            (2)    At initial planting, deciduous trees shall be a minimum of
two- and one-half-inch caliper, ornamental trees a minimum of two-inch caliper
and evergreen trees a minimum of five feet in height.
            (3)    The required height of a perimeter landscape screen may be
reduced where it is determined by the Village Engineer and/or Zoning Officer
that such landscaping would interfere with traffic safety and visibility.
            (4)    The required height of a perimeter landscape screen may be
increased where significant changes in elevations between an adjacent property
or public right-of-way make it necessary to comply with the intent of this
Ordinance.
          (5)    The selected combination of plant materials shall be a
harmonious combination of living deciduous and evergreen trees, shrubs and
vines irregularly spaced to provide an effective year-round screen and to
present an aesthetically pleasing view, and all quantities shall be based on
the on a landscape plan that has been submitted and approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (6)    Loose groundcover or mulch materials shall be placed or
effectively contained so they do not spill over into parking and access
facilities or the public right-of-way.
            (7)    All required landscape features within three feet of the
edge of parking or access facilities shall be protected from vehicle
encroachment by curbing, wheel stops or similar means.
            (8)    Where fifty or more parking spaces are provided, there shall
be at least 10 square feet of interior landscaped area per space provided
within the overall perimeter of the parking area.
            (9)    Interior landscaped areas shall be at least 125 square feet
in an area with a minimum dimension of no less than eight feet.
            (10)    At least one shade tree of a minimum two- and one-half-inch
caliper shall be planted in each interior landscaped area.
            (11)    There shall be at least one interior landscaped area for
each fifty parking spaces provided or fraction thereof.
            (12)    The application of the above standards may be adjusted, in
part or in whole, to allow credit for healthy plant material to be retained on
or adjacent to the site if such an adjustment is consistent with the intent of
this article.
      (r)    Maintenance.  It shall be the responsibility of the owner and
occupant of the property to maintain all parking and access facilities in a
safe and usable condition. This includes, among other things, patching, sealing
and replenishing paving; repainting space markings; repairing or replacing
curbing or wheel stops and cleaning on-site drainage facilities. It shall also
be the responsibility of the owner and occupant to maintain required landscape
in neat, clean, orderly and healthful condition. This includes, among other
things, pruning, mowing, weeding, litter removal, replacement of dead or
diseased plants, repair or replacement of broken or damaged walls, and the
regular feeding and water of plant materials.

1129.01 PURPOSE.
   These regulations are intended to:
   (a)   Minimize the transmission from one land use to another of nuisances
associated with noise, dust and glare.
   (b)   Minimize visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized
area. Minimal screening provides an impression of separation of spaces, and
more extensive screening can entirely shield the visual effects of an intense
land use from a less intense land use.
   (c)   Establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion
of intense land uses, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the
screening.
   (d)   Safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare, preserve the
aesthetic and environmental qualities, and enhance the community character.
      (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.02 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   Every development shall provide sufficient screening so that:
   (a)   Neighboring properties are shielded from adverse external effects of
that development, regardless of whether it is separated by a right-of-way.
   (b)   It provides a transition zone between dissimilar land uses.
      (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.03 SCOPE.
   (a)   Except where more stringent standards or procedures are specified in
this Ordinance, the standards and procedures in this chapter shall apply to all
required screening and buffering areas.
   (b)    For all commercial, industrial, office, institutional and multiple-
family uses in Commercial and Mixed Use zoning districts and for non-
residential uses in Residential districts there shall be provided and
maintained on the sides of the property abutting, adjacent to, or across the
street from a residential district a screening/buffer zone as specified in this
chapter, unless otherwise waived or reduced by the Commission or official
approving the site plan.
   
   (c)   For utility buildings, stations and/or substations, screening shall be
provided consisting of a six-foot high wall, berm or fence, except when all
equipment is contained within a building or structure which is comparable in
appearance to residential buildings in the surrounding area. (Ord. 21-2020.
Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.04 PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   Whenever landscape, screening and/or a buffer zone are required in this
chapter, a preliminary landscape/screening plan shall be submitted to the
Zoning Officer and a final plan approved by the Commission or other official
approving the site plan. The plan shall be prepared by a landscape architect
and sealed by an architect, landscape architect or engineer, and shall contain
the following:
   (a)   All applicable information required by this Ordinance for site plan
review.
   (b)   The location, general size, and type of existing vegetation to be
retained.
   (c)   Existing and proposed grades.
   (d)   A planting schedule and plan providing the following information:
      (1)   The botanical and common name of each plant used.
      (2)   The size of each plant to be used at the time of planting.
      (3)   The quantity of each plant to be used.
      (4)   Whether plants to be used are balled and burlapped, container grown
or bare root.
      (5)   The spacing and location of all proposed trees, shrubs, and ground
cover. Ground cover is defined as low-growing woody shrubs, deciduous or
evergreen plants, perennial plants and/or vines, such as low blueberry
(Vaccinium vacillans), bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), Northern bayberry
(Myrica pensylvanica), cotoneaster (Cotoneaster horizontalis), or blue rug
juniper (Juniperus horizantaus 'Wiltoni'). Grass and shredded bark, wood chips,
other similar mulch or landscaping stones are also acceptable as ground cover
for greenbelt areas.
   (e)   The percentage of landscaped area, excluding detention ponds, to be
provided on site. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.05  STANDARDS.
   (a)   The standards and explanation contained in this chapter establish the
screening requirements which satisfy the general performance standards set
forth in Section
1129.02, unless modifications as permitted under Section
1129.07 are applicable.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.06 SCREENING REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   Plant Material Requirements.
      (1)   Deciduous or evergreen shrubs used in a landscape screen shall be
at least two feet high at initial planting and shall be expected and permitted
to grow to a height of at least three feet within two years of planting; such
materials shall be expected and permitted to grow to a height of five feet.
      (2)   At initial planting, deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two- and
one-half-inch caliper, ornamental trees a minimum of two-inch caliper and
evergreen trees a minimum of five feet in height.
      (3)   The required height of a landscape screen may be reduced where it
is determined by the Village Engineer and/or Zoning Officer that such
landscaping would interfere with traffic safety and visibility.
      (4)   The required height of a landscape screen may be increased where
significant changes in elevations between an adjacent property or public right-
of-way make it necessary to comply with the intent of this Ordinance.
      (5)   The selected combination of plant materials shall be a harmonious
combination of living deciduous and evergreen trees, shrubs and vines
irregularly spaced to provide an effective year-round screen and to present an
aesthetically pleasing view, and all quantities shall be based on the on a
landscape plan that has been submitted and approved by the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Screening of Service Areas.
      (1)   For commercial, industrial, office, institutional and multiple-
family uses, all service areas, loading and unloading activities shall be
screened on those portions of the lot which abut a residential use. Screening
shall consist of walls, landscaped earthen mounds, fences, natural vegetation
or an acceptable combination of these elements, provided that screening must be
at least six feet in height.
      (2)   Natural vegetation screening shall have a minimum opaqueness of
seventy-five percent (75%) during full foliage. The use of year-round
vegetation, such as pines or evergreens, is encouraged. Vegetation shall be
planted no closer than three feet to any property line.
   (c)   Screening of Trash Receptacles. 
      (1)   For commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multiple-
family uses, all trash and garbage container systems shall be screened or
enclosed by walls, fences, or natural vegetation to screen them from view.
Container systems shall not be located in front yards, and shall conform to the
side and rear yard pavement setbacks in the applicable zoning District. The
height of such screening shall be at least six feet in height.
      (2)   Natural vegetation shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventy-five
percent (75%) at full foliage. The use of year-round vegetation, such as pines
and evergreens, is encouraged.
    (d)   Buffering and Screening Requirements. 
      (1)   For commercial, industrial, office and institutional uses which
abut an existing residential use, a buffer zone with a minimum width of five
feet should be created. Such screening within the buffer zone shall consist of
fencing, natural vegetation or a combination of both. Vegetation shall be
planted no closer than three feet to any property line. Natural vegetation
shall have a minimum opaqueness of seventy-five percent (75%) during full
foliage and shall be a variety which will attain at a minimum ten feet in
height within five years of planting.
   
   (e)   Perimeter Parking Landscaping.
      (1)    Landscaping within the perimeter setbacks of all parking lots
shall be in conformance with the standards established by Chapter
1125.
         (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.07 MODIFICATION OF SCREENING AND BUFFER ZONE REQUIREMENTS.
   Because of the wide variety of land uses and the relationships between them
and because of many different circumstances, the Commission may reduce or waive
the screening and buffer zone requirements of this chapter after a detailed
review and evaluation of an alternative screening plan. Whenever the Commission
modifies the screening requirement, it shall find that the following standards
have been met:
   (a)   The landscape/screening plan shall protect the character of new and
existing residential neighborhoods against negative impacts such as noise,
glare, light, air pollution, trash and debris, and hazardous activities.
   (b)   The Commission shall determine the screening, width and type of buffer
zone needed to ensure compatibility based upon the following criteria:
      (1)   The development is compatible with and sensitive to the immediate
environment of the site and neighborhood relative to architectural design,
scale, bulk, building height, identified historical character, disposition and
orientation of buildings on the lot and visual integrity.
      (2)   The site has natural existing vegetation and/or topography, natural
bodies of water or wetland areas or other existing conditions which offer
screening consistent with the standards set forth in this chapter. The
Commission shall require the retention of these natural features as a condition
of site plan approval.
      (3)   The arrangement, design and orientation of buildings on this site
lends itself so as to maximize the opportunity for privacy and isolation from
negative impacts of this project.
         (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.08  MATERIALS.
   Fences shall be constructed out of any of the following materials: redwood,
cedar, or No. 1 pressure treated wood, recycled lumber or vinyl closely
resembling wood, wrought iron or aluminum closely resembling wrought iron,
stone, brick, concrete with stone or brick veneer, or pre-cast concrete
simulated stone or brick. All other materials including but not limited to
chain link, vinyl clad chain link, woven wire or plastic mesh (with or without
wooden slats) are prohibited as buffer material unless otherwise and expressly
permitted by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.09  BERMS.
   (a)   Earthen berms required under this chapter shall consist of raised
earth with side slopes of three-to-one or flatter with a four-foot wide flat or
slightly rounded crest contoured to the side slopes to facilitate maintenance.
   (b)   Berms shall be covered with grass or other ground cover to prevent
erosion. Berms shall also be landscaped with plant materials. A detailed
landscape plan with a plant material list, including quantity, species, minimum
size and spacing, shall be submitted with the site plan and approved by the
Commission.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.10  LOCATION OF SCREENING.
   Screening required under this chapter shall be located directly adjacent to
the lot line except where underground utilities interfere.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.11 OPENINGS IN WALLS, FENCES, AND BERMS; CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS FOR WALLS.
   Walls, fences and berms required under this chapter shall have no openings
for vehicular traffic or other purposes, except such openings as may be
approved by the Commission. All walls required in this chapter shall be
constructed of stone, brick or shall have brick veneer on the side facing the
residential district. The height of the wall shall be measured from the
prevailing grade of the land on the residential side of the wall or berm. Walls
shall be erected on a concrete foundation which shall have a minimum depth of
forty-two inches below a grade approved by the Zoning Officer, and shall not be
less than four inches wider than the wall to be erected.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.12 BUMPER STOPS, CURBING OR WHEEL CHOCKS IN PARKING SPACES.
   Bumper stops, curbing or wheel chocks shall be provided in parking spaces
adjacent to a wall, fence or berm required under this chapter to prevent a
vehicle from encroaching on or damaging the screening improvement. Bumper
stops, curbing or wheel chocks shall be placed four feet from the required
screening improvement.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.13  CORNER CLEARANCE VISIBILITY.
   The Zoning Officer may require a reduction in the height of a screening
improvement where necessary to ensure adequate sight distance and/or corner
clearance visibility for drive approaches and public streets in proximity to a
screening improvement. In this case height may be reduced only for that portion
of the screening improvement necessary to provide adequate sight distance and/
or corner clearance necessary for traffic safety. Where it is necessary to
reduce the height of a screening improvement, height shall be reduced
gradually.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.14 IRRIGATION OF VEGETATION.
   Whenever a site plan requires landscaped earth berms or planted or natural
vegetation screening, such areas shall be provided with an irrigation system or
a readily available and acceptable water supply as approved by the Zoning
Officer.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.15 WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.
   The Commission or official approving the site plan may waive or reduce the
requirements of this chapter upon determining that the following would apply:
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter cannot be met; and
   (b)   Compliance with the requirements would impose a practical difficulty
on the applicant or would create safety hazards to pedestrians or motorists.
      (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1129.16 SCOPE OF PLANT MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Wherever in this chapter screening, planting and/or material in conjunction
with an obscuring fence is required, it shall be planted within six months from
the date of issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy and shall
thereafter be reasonably maintained with permanent plant materials to provide a
screen to abutting properties. The location, type and quantity of the proposed
landscape materials shall be installed in compliance with the landscape plan
approved by the Commission or the official approving the site plan.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)

      (d)    Provide review procedures that enable the Village to evaluate the
appropriateness of a sign to the site, building and surroundings.
      (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
      
1133.02  SCOPE OF REQUIREMENTS.
      It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to erect,
construct, or alter any sign in the Village except in conformance with the
provisions of this Ordinance, subject to issuance of a permit, unless
specifically exempted below. All temporary ground signs and banner signs shall
be registered with the Zoning Officer.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1133.03  ENFORCEMENT.
      (a)    Plans, Specifications, and Permits.
            (1)    Permits. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect,
alter, relocate or structurally change a sign or other advertising structure,
unless specifically exempted by this Ordinance, without first obtaining a
permit in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. A permit shall
require payment of a fee, as noted on a fee schedule as may be established,
adopted and amended from time to time by the Council.
            (2)    Applications. Application for a sign permit shall be made
upon forms provided by the Zoning Officer. The following information shall be
required:
                  A.    Name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
                  B.    Location of the building, structure or lot on which the
sign is to be attached or erected.
                  C.    Position of the sign in relation to nearby buildings,
structures and property lines. The Zoning Officer may require information to be
provided for on a certified survey or drawing sealed by a registered engineer.
                  D.    Plans showing the dimensions, materials, method of
construction and attachment to the building or in the ground.
                  E.    Copies of stress sheets and calculations, if deemed
necessary, showing the structure as designed for dead load and wind pressure.
                  F.    Name and address of the person, firm or corporation
owning, erecting, and maintaining the sign.
                  G.    Information concerning required electrical connections.
                  H.    Insurance policy or bond, as required in this
Ordinance.
                  I.    Written consent of the owner or lessee of the premises
upon which the sign is to be erected.
                  J.    Other information as required by the Zoning Officer to
make the determination that the sign is in compliance with all applicable laws
and regulations.
            (3)    Review of application.
                  A.    Commission review. Sign permit applications submitted
in conjunction with the proposed construction of a new building or addition to
an existing building shall be reviewed by the Commission as a part of the
required site plan review. Proposed sign locations and dimensions must be shown
on the site plan.
                  B.    Issuance of a permit. Following review and approval of
a sign application by the Commission and Zoning Officer, as appropriate, the
Zoning Officer shall have the authority to issue a sign permit.
            (4)    Exceptions. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated except
in conformity with the provisions set forth herein for new signs, nor until a
proper permit has been secured. However, a new permit shall not be required for
ordinary servicing or repainting of an existing sign, cleaning of a sign, or
changing of the message on the sign where the sign is designed for such changes
(such as lettering on a marquee or numbers on a gasoline price sign).
Furthermore, a permit shall not be required for sign plates for residential
uses, temporary signs for dwelling units, and temporary windows signs, provided
that all applicable regulations of this chapter are complied with.
  
   (b)    Inspection and Maintenance.
      (1)    Inspection of new signs. All signs for which a permit has been
issued shall be inspected by the Zoning Officer when erected. Approval shall be
granted only if the sign has been constructed in compliance with the approved
plans and applicable Zoning Ordinance and Building Code standards. In cases
where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or otherwise
enclosed, the sign erector shall advise the Zoning Officer when such fastenings
are to be installed so that inspection may be completed before enclosure.
            (2)    Inspection of existing signs.  The Zoning Officer shall have
the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect existing signs. In
conducting such inspections, the Zoning Officer shall determine whether the
sign is adequately supported, painting to prevent corrosion, and so secured to
the building or other support to safely bear the weight of the sign and
pressure created by the wind.
            (3)    Correction of defects. If the Zoning Officer finds that any
sign is unsafe, insecure, improperly constructed, or poorly maintained, the
sign erector, owner of the sign, or owner of the land shall make the sign safe
and secure by completing any necessary reconstruction or repairs, or entirely
remove the sign in accordance with the timetable established by the Zoning
Officer.
   
   (c)   Removal of Obsolete Signs.  Any sign that no longer identifies a
business that is in operation, or that identifies an activity or event that has
already occurred, shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed by the
owner, agent, or person having use of the building or structure. Upon vacating
a commercial or industrial establishment, the proprietor shall be responsible
for removal of all signs used in conjunction with the business. However, where
a conforming sign structure and frame are typically reused by a current
occupant in a leased or rented building, the building owner shall not be
required to remove the sign structure and frame in the interim periods when the
building is not occupied, provided that the sign structure and frame are
maintained in good condition.
   
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs. No nonconforming sign shall be altered or
reconstructed, unless the alteration or reconstruction is in compliance with
this Ordinance, except that nonconforming signs shall comply with the following
regulations:
      (1)   Repairs and maintenance. Normal maintenance shall be permitted,
provided that any nonconforming sign that is destroyed by any means to an
extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of the sign's pre-catastrophe fair
market value, exclusive of the foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal
maintenance shall include painting of chipped or faded signs; replacement of
faded or damaged surface panels; or, repair or replacement of electrical wiring
or electrical devices.
            (2)    Nonconforming changeable copy signs. The message on a
nonconforming changeable copy sign or nonconforming bulletin board sign may be
changed provided that the change does not create any greater nonconformity.
            (3)    Substitution. No nonconforming sign shall be replaced with
another nonconforming sign.
             (4)    Modifications to the principal building. Whenever the
principal building on a site on which a nonconforming sign is located is
modified to the extent that site plan review and approval is required, the
nonconforming sign shall be removed.
   
   (e)   Appeal to the Board.  Any party who has been refused a sign permit for
a proposed sign may file an appeal with the Board, in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance. In determining whether a variance is appropriate,
the Board shall, in addition to other review criteria specified in this
Ordinance, study the sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary
circumstances, such as those listed below, that would cause practical
difficulty in complying with the sign standards. The presence of any of the
circumstances listed may be sufficient to justify granting a variance; however,
the Board may decline to grant a variance even if certain of the following
circumstances are present:
            (1)    Permitted signage could not be easily seen by passing
motorists due to the configuration of existing buildings, trees or other
obstructions.
            (2)    Permitted signage could not be seen by passing motorists in
sufficient time to permit safe deceleration and exit. In determining whether
such circumstances exist, the Board shall consider the width of the road, the
number of moving lanes, the volume of traffic, and speed limits.
            (3)    Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce
the visibility or advertising impact of a conforming sign on the subject
parcel.
            (4)    Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or
severe alteration to natural features on the parcel, such as but not limited
to: removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, filling of
wetlands, or obstruction of a natural drainage course.
            (5)    Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision
of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passers-by.
            (6)    Variances from certain sign regulations would be offset by
increased building setback, increased landscaping, or other such enhancements,
so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared
to the result that would be otherwise achieved with construction of a
conforming sign.
            (7)    A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards
of this Ordinance would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size
or frontage of the parcel or building.
         (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
         
1133.04 COMPUTATION AND MEASUREMENTS.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign height, window area and building frontage:
      (a)    Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
            (1)    Sign area shall include the face of all the display area of
the sign. Sign area shall not include the frame and structural support unless
such structural support is determined to constitute an integral part of the
sign design.
            (2)    For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area of
the sign shall be the area of one rectangular shape that encompasses the entire
background or frame.
           (3)    For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures or
elements on a wall or similar surface of a building or structure, an irregular
shaped ground sign, the area of the sign shall be the area of one rectangular
shape that encompasses the perimeter of all the elements in the display.
                  A.    When separate elements are organized to form a single
sign, but the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be the area
of one rectangular shape that comprises all the display areas, including the
space between the elements.
                  B.    One minor extension may be permitted to extend above or
below the sign area when the area of the extension is less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the open space included in the sign area. For the purposes of
this chapter, only the open space within the sign area that is located above
and below the majority of the letters shall be included in the calculation.
                  C.    For ground signs and projecting signs, the sign area
shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces when two identical
display faces are joined, are parallel or within 30 degrees of being parallel
to each other.
                  D.    Air under a ground sign between supporting posts, air
between a projecting sign and the wall to which it is attached, and lighting
fixtures and associated brackets shall not be included in the calculation of
sign area.
      (b)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured
from the average grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the
tallest element of the calculated sign area or support structure. A ground sign
on a man-made base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the
average site grade prior to the addition of the sign.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of
these sign regulations, the length of the building wall that faces a public
street or that contains a public entrance to the uses therein shall be
considered the building frontage:
      (1)    The building frontage shall be measured along such building wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)    In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)    A building shall have only one building frontage except as
otherwise set forth below.
      (4)    A building shall have two frontages whenever the lot fronts on two
or more streets, or the building has a public entrance on a wall other than the
wall that faces the street. The property owner shall determine which wall shall
be the primary building frontage and which wall shall be the secondary building
frontage. Only one outside wall of any business shall be considered its primary
frontage and only one additional wall considered its secondary frontage.
            (5)   For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that
is owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit.
The building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline
of the party walls defining the building unit.
   (d)   Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of
determining window area for ground floor occupants, the ground floor shall be
considered to be no more than 15 feet in height above grade.

1141.38 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS.
      (a)   Purpose.  These regulations governing telecommunications towers are
established to provide for the construction, execution, extension and removal
of such towers in districts permitting residential uses in the Village and are
related to certain applications of technology and engineering in the field of
telecommunications. The purpose of these regulations is to balance the
competing interests created by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996
(Public Law 104-104) and the interests of the Village in regulating
telecommunications towers and related facilities for the following reasons:
            (1)    To provide for orderly development within the Village;
            (2)    To protect property values;
            (3)    To maintain the aesthetic appearance of the Village,
including, but not limited to, its residential character, local business areas,
and scenic views;
            (4)    To protect residential properties, parks, open spaces and
the commercial and institutional zoning districts from the adverse effects of
towers and related facilities;
            (5)    To promote collocation of telecommunications towers in order
to decrease the total number of towers in the Village; and
            (6)    To provide for and protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents and visitors of the Village.
   (b)   Applicability. No person shall locate, erect, construct, reconstruct,
change, alter, remove or enlarge a telecommunications tower in the Village
without compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   
   (c)   Use Regulations.
            (1)    A telecommunications tower shall only be permitted as a
conditional use in the MU District. A telecommunication tower is not permitted
in any other zoning district in the Village.
            (2)    The installation of a telecommunication antenna(s), and the
expansion of an existing equipment shelter to serve such antenna(s), may be
permitted as a conditional use on an existing telecommunication tower in any
district.
            (3)    The installation of a telecommunications antenna where the
construction or erection of a tower is not proposed by the applicant, shall be
permitted as an accessory use on existing towers, buildings or structures. To
the extent the remaining standards of this section are applicable to the
situation involving the installation of a telecommunications antenna(s) on an
existing tower, building or structure, such standards shall govern the
installation.
   
   (d)   Collocation.
            (1)    All applicants for construction or erection of
telecommunications towers shall be required to construct on a base tower
structure and structure foundation that is designed to be buildable, up to, but
not including, 200 feet above grade. Such structure shall be designed to have
sufficient structural loading capacity to accommodate at least four antenna
platforms or antenna arrays of equal loading capacity for four separate
providers of service to be located on the structure when constructed to the
maximum allowable height. The telecommunications facility shall also be
designed to show that the applicant has enough space on its site plan for an
equipment shelter large enough to accommodate at least four separate users of
the facility. If an equipment shelter is initially constructed to accommodate
only one user, space shall be reserved on site for equipment shelter expansions
to accommodate up to at least four separate users.
Agreement to the provisions of this subsection must be included in the
applicant's lease with the landowner, if different from the owner/user of the
tower. Written documentation must be presented to the Commission evidencing
that the landowner of the property on which the tower is to be located has
agreed to the terms of this subsection. As an additional condition of issuing a
conditional use permit, the owner/user shall respond in writing to any
inquiries regarding collocation of another user of the facility within 30 days
after receipt of a written inquiry. Copies of all written requests to collocate
and all written responses shall be sent to the Commission.
            (2)    The applicant requesting permission to install a new tower
shall provide evidence that there is no technically suitable space for the
applicant's antenna(s) and related facilities reasonably available on an
existing tower, building or structure within the geographic area to be served.
With its application, the applicant shall identify the location of every tower,
building or structure that could support the proposed antenna(s) or area where
it would be technically suitable to locate so as to allow it to serve its
intended function. As part of its application, the applicant shall provide a
scaled map of all of its existing, proposed or planned antenna locations within
a five-mile radius of the site which is the subject of the application.
The applicant must demonstrate that a technically suitable location is not
reasonably available on an existing tower, building or structure. If an
existing tower, building or structure is technically suitable, the applicant
must demonstrate that it has made written request to collocate on the existing
tower, building or structure and the request was rejected by the owner of the
tower, building or structure. In all circumstances, owners of existing towers

   (c)   Submission of Site Plan for Review by Commission. In order to initiate
formal review by the Commission, the applicant is required to submit the
following materials to the Zoning Officer:
      (1)    Three completed and signed copies of an application for Site Plan
Review;
      (2)    Eight individually folded copies of the site plan; one each for
the Solicitor; Fiscal Officer file; Zoning Officer; and each member of the
Planning Commission.
      (3)    Evidence that the plan has been submitted for review to affected
and applicable county, state and federal agencies; and
      (4)    Any required applicable fees.
   These materials must be submitted to the Zoning Officer in sufficient time
to allow review by Village staff and consultants prior to the Commission
meeting at which the review will occur. The Zoning Officer will submit
materials to the Fiscal Officer within 30 days after the date of filing. The
Zoning Officer shall determine if additional time is needed based on the scope
and complexity of the proposal.
   
   (d)   Distribution of Plans. Upon submission of all required application
materials and following completion of all items required, the proposed site
plan shall be placed on the agenda of a special or regular meeting of the
Commission. The site plan and application shall be distributed by the Fiscal
Officer to appropriate Village officials and the Village Planner for review. If
deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer, the plans may also be submitted to the
Village Engineer for review.
   
   (e)    Review and Action.
      (1)    Informal review of conceptual plans by Village staff. Applicants
are encouraged to meet with the Village Staff, including but not limited to the
Village Engineer, Village Planner, and such other persons as determined by the
Zoning Officer, for informal review of conceptual site plans. The purpose of
this informal review is to discuss applicable standards and technical issues,
comment on the project's compliance with the standards of this Ordinance, and
determine the appropriate type of review process. The applicant or Village
Planner may also request input from other Village staff or consultants.
Conceptual plans should, at minimum, include the proposed use, building
footprint, existing conditions, general site layout and conceptual grading.
Conceptual plan review comments are non-binding, and should be considered by
the applicant to be suggestions and recommendations only. A review fee may be
required for conceptual plan review, as determined by Village.
            (2)    Informal review by the Commission. The Commission may
request an informal workshop and formal regular or special meetings on a
proposed project. The meeting at which a site plan proposal is considered shall
be a workshop meeting of the Commission. The Commission shall review the
reports of the appropriate Village staff and consultants and discuss the
findings and recommendations with the applicant. No formal action on a site
plan will occur at the workshop meeting.
            (3)    Request for revisions. Upon review of the site plan proposal
at a workshop, the Commission may require the applicant to revise the plans or
supply additional information. The applicant shall submit any requested revised
plans for review prior to formal action being taken. All review fees must be
paid prior to any review. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to consult
with Village staff and consultants during this revision process. Action on the
site plan shall remain tabled until the next regular Commission meeting
following review of a substantially complete plan at a Commission workshop.
            (4)    Public hearing. A site plan involving use(s) subject to
conditional use approval, planned residential development, or planned unit
developments, shall require a public hearing. After payment of appropriate
fees, the Commission shall set the date of the public hearing during a regular
or special meeting of the Planning Commission. No hearing may be held before
the Commission has had an opportunity to review the plan at a workshop session.
            (5)    Final action.  The Commission shall review the site plan,
together with any reports and recommendations from staff, consultants and other
reviewing agencies and any public comments. The Commission shall then make a
determination based on the requirements and standards of this Ordinance. The
Commission is authorized to table, approve, approve subject to conditions or
deny the site plan as follows:
                  A.    Table. Upon determination by the Commission that a site
plan is not sufficiently complete for approval or denial, or upon a request by
the applicant, the Commission may table the item until a later meeting.
                 B.    Denial. Upon determination that a site plan does not
comply with the standards and regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or would
require extensive revisions to comply with said standards and regulations, the
site plan shall be denied. If a site plan is denied, a written record shall be
provided to the applicant listing the reasons for such denial. Failure of the
applicant, or the applicant's designated representative, to attend two
scheduled meetings shall be grounds for the Commission to deny approval of the
site plan.
           C.    Approval. Upon determination that a site plan is in compliance
with the requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and
laws, the site plan shall be approved.
                  D.    Approval subject to conditions. The Commission may
approve a site plan, subject to one or more conditions necessary to address
minor modifications to the site plan, ensure that public services and
facilities can accommodate the proposed use, protect significant natural
features, ensure compatibility with adjacent land uses, or otherwise meet the
intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
   The applicant shall re-submit the site plan for final approval by the
Commission after conditions have been met. The Commission may waive its right
to review the revised plan, and delegate authority to the Zoning Officer or
staff to review and approve a revised site plan on the Commission's behalf
after required conditions have been addressed. The Commission may require that
the Zoning Officer secure a favorable recommendation from the Village Planner
and/or Village Engineer prior to final approval of the revised plan.
   (f)   Appeal of Decision.  The applicant, or any interested party, may
appeal the decision of the Commission on a site plan to the Board. Such appeal
shall proceed in accordance with the procedures outlined for appeals in this
Ordinance.
   
   (g)    Recording of Site Plan Action. Commission action on the site plan
shall be recorded in the Commission meeting minutes, stating the name and
location of the project, the proposed use, the most recent plan revision date,
and the conditions or grounds for the Commission's action. The Commission
secretary shall clearly mark three copies of the application and final site
plans APPROVED or DENIED, as appropriate, with the date that action was taken.
One marked copy will be returned to the applicant and the other two copies will
be kept on file by the Village.
   (h)   Procedure After Site Plan Approval. Any property owner who fails to
maintain an approved site plan in full compliance with approvals granted by the
Commission according to the provisions of this Ordinance, shall be deemed in
violation of the use provisions of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the
penalties stated herein.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1149.03 MINOR SITE PLAN MODIFICATIONS/ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.
   Minor Site Plan Modifications: If a minor site plan modification is made, an
applicant may have an administrative review and not be required to go before
the Commission to amend the site plan. Variances, planned residential
developments, planned unit developments, or the expansion of a nonconforming
use are not eligible for an administrative review. Each action related to
modification of a site plan shall be duly recorded in writing on a copy of the
approved plan, and shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Officer.
The Zoning Officer shall have the authority to require a new site plan for the
purposes of clarity. The Commission shall be advised of all minor site plan
modifications approved by the Zoning Officer, and such modifications shall be
noted on the site plan and in the minutes of the Commission.
Administrative review: The following activities shall be eligible for
administrative plan review in accordance with this chapter:
      (a)    Minor changes during construction due to unanticipated site
constraints, or to improve safety, protect natural features, or comply with

1149.05  STANDARDS FOR SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   The following criteria shall be used as a basis upon which site plans will
be reviewed and approved, approved with conditions or denied:
      (a)    Adequacy of Information and Compliance with Ordinance
Requirements.  The site plan includes all required information in a complete
and understandable form that provides an accurate description of the proposed
uses, structures and site improvements. The site plan complies with all
applicable Ordinance requirements, including but not limited to minimum floor
space, height of building, lot size, yard space and density.
     (b)    Site Design Characteristics. All elements of the site design are
harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to topography, parcel
configuration, adjacent properties, traffic operations, adjacent streets and
driveways, pedestrian access and the type and size of buildings. The site is
designed in a manner that promotes the normal and orderly development of
surrounding property for uses permitted by this Ordinance.
      (c)    Site Appearance and Coordination. Site elements are designed and
located so that the proposed development is aesthetically pleasing and
harmonious with adjacent existing or future developments. All site features,
including vehicle and pedestrian circulation, building orientation,
landscaping, lighting, utilities, recreation facilities, and open space are
harmonious and coordinated with adjacent properties.
      (d)    Preservation of Site Features.  The site design preserves and
conserves natural, cultural, historical and architectural site features,
including, but not limited to, architecturally or historically significant
buildings, archeological sites, wetlands, topography, tree-rows and hedgerows,
wooded areas, and significant individual trees.
       (e)    Pedestrian Access and Circulation.  The arrangement of public or
common ways for pedestrian circulation connects to existing or planned
sidewalks or bicycle pathways in the area and is insulated as completely as
possible from the vehicular circulation system. The site design complies with
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding barrier-free
access.
      (f)    Vehicular Access and Circulation. Drives, streets, parking, site
access and other vehicle-related elements are designed to minimize traffic
conflicts on adjacent streets and promote safe and efficient traffic
circulation within the site.
      (g)    Building Design and Architecture. Building design and architecture
relate to and are harmonious with the surrounding neighborhood with regard to
texture, scale, mass, proportion, materials and color, and conforms to Historic
Preservation Overlay District standards, if applicable.
      (h)    Parking and Loading. Off-street parking lots and loading zones are
arranged, located and designed to accommodate the intensity of proposed uses,
minimize conflicts with adjacent uses, enhance the character of the
neighborhood, and promote shared-use of common facilities by adjoining
properties.
      (i)    Landscaping and Screening. Landscaping and screening are provided
in a manner that adequately buffers adjacent land uses and screens off-street
parking, mechanical appurtenances, loading and unloading areas and storage
areas from adjacent residential areas and public rights-of-way.
      (j)    Exterior Lighting. All exterior lighting fixtures are designed,
arranged and shielded to minimize glare and light trespass, prevent night
blindness and vision impairments, and maximum security.
      (k)    Impact Upon Public Services. The impact upon public services will
not exceed the existing or planned capacity of such services, and adequate
public services (including but not limited to utilities (water, sanitary &
storm sewers, county drains, natural gas, electricity and telephone), streets,
police and fire protection, public schools and sidewalks/bicycle paths) are
available or provided to the site, and are designed with sufficient capacity
and durability to properly serve the development.
      (l)    Drainage and Soil Erosion. Drainage systems, stormwater
facilities, and soil erosion, sedimentation and dust control measures are
arranged, located and designed to promote shared-use of common facilities by
adjoining properties. Adjoining properties, public rights-of-way, capacity of
the public storm drainage system, and local streams will not be adversely
affected by stormwater runoff and sedimentation.
      (m)    Emergency Access and Vulnerability to Hazards.  All sites and
buildings are designed to allow convenient and direct emergency access, and the
level of vulnerability to injury or loss from incidents involving hazardous
materials or processes will not exceed the Village's emergency response
capabilities.
      (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1149.06 DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
      It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property for which
site plan approval has been granted to develop, improve and maintain the site,
including the use, buildings and all site elements in accordance with the
approved site plan and all conditions of approval, until the property is razed
or a new site plan is approved. Failure to comply with the provisions of this
section shall be a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same
penalties appropriate for a use violation. The Zoning Officer shall make
periodic on-site investigations of developments for which site plans have been
approved. Noncompliance with the requirements and conditions of the approved
site plan shall constitute grounds for the Commission to rescind site plan
approval.
(Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1149.07  CONDITIONAL USE REGULATIONS.
      (a)    Intent. The procedures and standards in this section are intended
to provide a consistent and uniform method for review of conditional use
proposals. Conditional uses are uses, either public or private, which possess
unique characteristics and therefore cannot be properly classified as permitted
uses in a particular zoning district. These review procedures and standards are
intended to accomplish the following purposes:
            (1)    Ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this
Ordinance and other applicable local ordinances, and state and federal laws.
            (2)    Achieve efficient use of the land.
      (3)    Prevent adverse impact on adjoining or nearby properties.
      (4)    Protect natural resources.
      (5)    Facilitate development in accordance with the Village's land use
objectives.
      (6)    Minimize and mitigate adverse impacts upon the Village's ability
to provide services.
   (b)   Procedures and Requirements. Conditional use applications shall be
submitted in accordance with the following procedures and requirements, which
provide for review and action by the Commission. Although a site plan must be
submitted with a conditional use application, approval of the conditional use
is required prior to site plan approval.
      (1)    Applicant eligibility.  The application shall be submitted by the
owner of an interest in land for which conditional use approval is sought, or
by the owner's designated agent. The applicant or a designated representative
should be present at all scheduled review meetings or consideration of the
proposal may be tabled.
      (2)    Application forms and documentation. The application for
conditional use shall be made on the forms and according to the guidelines in
this Ordinance, as provided by the Zoning Officer.
            (3)    Application data requirements. A site plan shall be
submitted with the conditional use application. In addition, the applicant
shall complete any forms and supply any other data that may be required by the
Commission, Council, or Village staff to make the determination required
herein. The applicant shall provide all necessary written or graphic materials
to document compliance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance, and
other regulatory guidelines specified for particular conditional uses elsewhere
in this Ordinance.
            (4)    Site plan preparation.  The site plan shall be prepared in
the manner specified in this Ordinance and on the conditional use application
form. A site plan which does not meet the stipulated requirements shall be
considered incomplete and shall therefore not be subject to formal review. The
Zoning Officer may waive the site plan requirement if it is deemed it is not
necessary to evaluate the application.
            (5)    Submission of a completed plan. The conditional use
application materials, required fees, and eight copies of the completed site
plan and application shall be submitted to the Zoning Officer.
            (6)    Review by the Village officials.  The Zoning Officer and
other appropriate Village officials shall determine the completeness of the
site plan and application materials; and prepare an itemized list, which shall
specify any deficiencies in the site plan and application materials; and make
recommendations as appropriate.
            (7)    Submission of a revised plan and conditional use
application. The applicant shall revise the site plan and application
materials, based on the recommendations set forth in the Zoning Officer's
review. The applicant shall then submit eight (8) copies of the revised plan
for further review by staff and the Commission.
            (8)    Commission consideration.  After all application materials
have been received and applicable fees paid, the application shall be reviewed
in accordance with following procedures:
                  A.    Acceptance for processing. The application shall be
placed on the agenda of the next available scheduled Commission meeting and a
public hearing shall be scheduled.
                  B.    Public hearing. Notice of the public hearing shall be
posted on the Village website and at the Village posting locations and sent by
mail or personal delivery to the owners of property for which special approval
is being considered and to all property owners adjacent to or across the street
from the property in question at least ten days prior to the date of the public
hearing
                  C.    Commission review. Following the public hearing, but
not necessarily at the same meeting, the conditional use proposal and plan
shall be reviewed by the Commission, based on the standards and regulations in
this section.
                  D.    Plan revision. If the Commission determines that
revisions are necessary to bring the conditional use proposal into compliance
with applicable standards and regulations, the applicant shall be given the
opportunity to submit a revised application and site plan. Following submission
of revised application materials, the conditional use proposal shall be placed
on the agenda of the next available scheduled meeting of the Commission for
further review and possible action.
            (9)    Commission determination. The Commission shall review the
application for conditional use, together with the public hearing findings and
reports and recommendations from the Zoning Officer, Village Planner, Village
Engineer, public safety officials and other reviewing agencies. The Commission
shall then make a determination on the conditional use application, based on
the requirements and standards of this Ordinance. The Commission may approve,
approve with conditions, or deny a conditional use request as follows:
                A.    Approval. Upon determination by the Commission that the
final plan for conditional use is in compliance with the standards and
requirements of this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and laws,
approval shall be granted.
                  B.    Approval with conditions. The Commission may impose
reasonable conditions with the approval of a conditional use proposal, to the
extent authorized by law. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following
requirements:
                     1.    Conditions shall be designed to protect natural
resources, the health, safety and general welfare and the social and economic
well-being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration,
residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or
activity, and the community as a whole.
            2.    Conditions shall be related to the valid exercise of the
police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
            3.    Conditions shall be necessary to meet the intent and purpose
of this Ordinance, related to the standards established in this Ordinance for
the land use or activity under consideration, related to the standards for
granting a conditional use and necessary to ensure compliance with those
standards.
                  C.    Denial. Upon determination by the Commission that a
conditional use proposal does not comply with the standards and regulations set
forth in this Ordinance, or otherwise would be injurious to the public health,
safety, general welfare, and orderly development of the Village, the
conditional use proposal shall be denied.
            (10)    Appeal of decision.  The applicant, or any interested
party, may appeal the decision of the Commission on a conditional use to the
Board. Such appeal shall proceed in accordance with the procedures outlined for
appeals in this Ordinance.
            (11)    Recording of Commission action.  Each action taken with
respect to a conditional use shall be duly recorded in the minutes of the
Commission. The minutes shall record the findings of fact relative to each
conditional use proposal, the grounds for the action taken, and any conditions
imposed in conjunction with approval.
            (12)    Effect of approval. Upon approval, a conditional use shall
be deemed a conforming use permitted in the district in which it is proposed,
subject to any conditions imposed and final approval of the site plan. Such
approval shall affect only the lot or portion thereof on which the proposed use
is located.
            (13)    Transferability.  Conditional use approval shall apply only
to the owner of the lot, and to the tenant if different from the owner, at the
time of approval. Transfer of property ownership and/or transfer of tenancy
shall terminate a conditional use approval, and a new approval shall be
required in order to re-establish or continue the previously approved use under
new ownership and/or tenancy.
      (14)    Application for a building permit.  Prior to issuance of a
building permit, the applicant shall submit proof of the following:
                  A.    Final approval of the conditional use application.
                  B.    Final approval of the site plan, if required.
                  C.    Final approval of the engineering plans, if required.
                 D.    Acquisition of all other applicable Village, county, or
state permits
            (15)    Expiration of conditional use approval. If construction has
not commenced within 12 months of final approval, the approval becomes null and
void and a new application for conditional use shall be required. Upon written
request from the applicant, a 12-month extension may be granted by the
Commission, if it finds that the approved conditional use application and site
plan adequately represent current conditions on and surrounding the site. The
written request for extension must be received prior to the site plan
expiration date or a new application for conditional use review will be
required.
            (16)    Revocation of conditional use approval. Approval of a
conditional use proposal and site plan may be revoked by the Commission if
construction is not in conformance with the approved plans. In such a case, the
Zoning Officer shall ask that the conditional use proposal be placed on the
agenda of the Commission. Written notice shall be provided to the applicant at
least five days prior to the meeting at which the case will be considered. The
applicant shall be given the opportunity to present information and to answer
questions. The Commission, as appropriate, may revoke approval if it finds that
a violation exists and has not been remedied prior to the hearing.
   
   (c)   Standards for Granting Conditional Use Approval.  Approval of a
conditional use proposal shall be based on the determination that the proposed
use will comply with applicable requirements of this Ordinance, including site
plan review criteria set forth for applicable site development standards for
specific uses set forth elsewhere in this Ordinance, and the following
standards:
            (1)    Compatibility with adjacent uses. The proposed conditional
use shall be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to be compatible
with uses on surrounding land. The site design shall minimize the impact of
site activity on surrounding properties. In determining whether this
requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to:
                  A.    The location and screening of vehicular circulation and
parking areas in relation to surrounding development.
                  B.    The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor
activity or work areas, and mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding
development.
                  C.    The hours of operation of the proposed use. Approval of
a conditional use may be conditioned upon operation within specified hours
considered appropriate to ensure minimal impact on surrounding uses.
                  D.    The bulk placement and materials of construction of the
proposed use in relation to surrounding uses.
           (2)    Compatibility with the Long-Range Plan. The proposed
conditional use shall be consistent with the general principles and objectives
of the Long-Range Plan.
            (3)    Compliance with applicable regulations. The proposed
conditional use shall be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and
local laws and ordinances.
            (4)    Use of adjacent property. The proposed conditional use shall
not interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent property.
           (5)    Public services. The proposed conditional use shall not
exceed the capacity of existing and available public services, including but
not necessarily limited to utilities, public roads, police and fire protection
services, and educational services, unless the project proposal contains an
acceptable plan for providing necessary services or evidence that such services
will be available by the time the conditional use is completed will not create
excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and
services and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community.
            (6)    Impact of traffic. The location of the proposed conditional
use within the zoning district shall minimize the impact of traffic generated
by the proposed use. In determining whether this requirement has been met,
consideration shall be given to the following:
                  A.    Proximity and access to major thoroughfares.
                  B.    Estimated traffic generated by the proposed use.
                  C.    Proximity and relation to intersections.
                  D.    Adequacy of driver sight distances.
                  E.    Location of and access to off-street parking.
                  F.    Required vehicular turning movements.
                  G.    Provision of pedestrian traffic.
            (7)    Enhancement of surrounding environment. The proposed
conditional use shall provide the maximum feasible enhancement of the
surrounding environment, and shall not unreasonably interfere with or
discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings
or unreasonably affect their value. In determining whether this requirement has
been met, consideration shall be given to:
                  A.    The provision of landscaping and other site amenities.
Provision of additional landscaping over and above the specific requirements of
this Ordinance may be required as a condition of approval of a conditional use.
                  B.   The bulk, placement and materials of construction of
proposed structures in relation to surrounding uses.
            (8)    Impact on public health, safety and general welfare. The
proposed conditional use shall not involve any activities, processes,
materials, equipment or conditions of operation, and shall not be located or
designed in a manner that is detrimental to public health, safety and general
welfare. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration
shall be given to the production of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, fumes,
odors, dust, glare and light.
      (9)    Isolation of existing uses. The location of the proposed
conditional use shall not result in a small residential area being
substantially surrounded by non-residential development, and further, the
location of the proposed conditional use shall not result in a small non-
residential area being substantially surrounded by incompatible uses.
         (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1149.08 VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
      (a)    Intent. The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and
standards to be followed by the Board in considering requests for variances and
appeals, where the jurisdiction of the Board has been established by these
regulations or by the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   Purpose of Variances and Appeals.
      (1)    Appeals. Generally, an appeal may be taken to the Board, by a
person, or by any office, department, board or bureau aggrieved by a written
order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination made by the
Commission or any administrative or enforcement official or body charged with
enforcement of this Ordinance. An appeal must be filed within fourteen days of
issuance of the applicable written decision, and such appeal shall be made on
forms made available by the Zoning Officer.
      (2)    Variances. Where there are "practical difficulties" (for area
variances) or "unnecessary hardships" (for use variances) preventing a property
owner from conforming with the strict letter of this Ordinance, the Board shall
have the power to authorize variances from the standards in this Ordinance,
with such conditions and safeguards as it may determine to be necessary so that
the spirit of this Ordinance is observed, public safety secured, and
substantial justice done.
   
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal to the Board shall stay enforcement
proceedings in furtherance of the appealed action, unless the Zoning Officer
certifies to the Board that by reason of the facts stated in the appeal, a stay
would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall
not be stayed other than by an injunction granted by the Court of Common Pleas.
A stay of proceedings shall not stay the Village's authority to issue a stop
work order on a project that may be in progress and being performed in a manner
that is not in conformance with applicable ordinances and regulations. Also, it
shall not stay a project when the appeal is brought by a third-party contesting
the issuance of a permit.
   
   (d)   Application.  Variances and appeals for which Board action is sought
shall be commenced by a person filing an application to the Board on forms as
specified by the Zoning Officer and accompanied by required fees. The
application shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based and shall
contain a signature of the property owner or owner's agent, and the signature
of the applicant if different than the owner. Applications involving a request
for a variance shall specify the section number(s) containing the standards
from which the variance is sought and the nature and extent of such variance.
   (e)   Plot Plan Requirements. Applications involving a specific site shall
be accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale that includes the following
information, where applicable:
             (1)    Applicant's name, address and telephone number.
            (2)    Property tax identification number, scale, north point, and
dates of submission and revisions.
            (3)    Zoning classification of petitioner's parcel and all
abutting parcels.
            (4)    Existing lot lines, building lines, structures, parking
areas, driveways, and other improvements on the site and within fifty feet of
the site.
            (5)    For variances requested from any dimensional standard of
this Ordinance, the plot plan shall include verified measurements of existing
conditions and the proposed dimensions and calculations regarding the specific
standards from which the variance is sought.
            (6)    Any additional information required by the Zoning Officer or
the Board to make the determination requested herein.
      Where an application to the Board involves a variance sought in
conjunction with a site plan or conditional use review by the Commission, the
application data requirements for the other applicable review as set forth in
this Ordinance shall be followed.
    
   (f)    Use Variance Requirements. Applications involving requests for a use
variance shall be accompanied by the following information:
      (1)    A plot plan as required by subsection (e) if the information is
deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to assist the Board in evaluating the
request.
      (2)    A description of the use variance requested and the applicant's
reasons for not complying with the requirements of this ordinance.
            (3)    Any additional information required by the Zoning Officer or
the Board to make the determination requested herein.
   
   (g)   Review. The Zoning Officer shall forward the application, along with
any supporting materials and plans to the Board. The Clerk of the Board shall
fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or variance. Notice of the
public hearing shall be posted on the Village website and at the Village
posting locations and sent by mail or personal delivery to the owners of
property for which special approval is being considered and to all property
owners adjacent to or across the street from the property in question at least
ten days prior to the date of the public hearing. At the hearing, a party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (h)    Decision. The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of the
administrative official or body, or to decide in favor of the applicant any
matter upon which they are required to pass under, or to effect any variation
in an ordinance adopted pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code. The Board may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination, in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.
To that end, the Board shall have all the powers of the officer or body from
whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
With an affirmative decision, the Board may impose conditions. The decision of
the Board shall be final, but any person having an interest affected by a
decision of the Board may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.
   
   (i)    Record of Decision and Order. The Board shall prepare and retain a
record of each appeal, and shall base its decision on this record. This record
shall include:
             (1)    The relevant administrative records and the administrative
orders issued thereon relating to the appeal.
            (2)    The notice of the appeal.
           (3)    Such documents, exhibits, plans, photographs, or written
reports as may be submitted to the Board for its consideration.
   The written findings of fact, the decisions, and the conditions imposed by
the Board in acting on the appeal shall be entered into the official record,
after being signed by the Secretary of the Board. The final written decision
shall constitute the final decision of the Board. Upon signing the final
written decision, the Secretary of the Board shall serve by mail, a copy of the
final decision on any matter upon the applicant and other parties- in-interest.
 
      (j)    Approval Period. If construction has not commenced within twelve
months after the Board grants a variance to permit the erection or alteration
of a building, then the variance becomes null and void. The period of approval
may be automatically extended by twelve months if the variance was sought in
conjunction with a site plan for which approval has been extended by the
Commission.
   (k)    Standards for Variances and Appeals. Variances and appeals shall be
granted only in accordance with and based on the findings set forth in this
section. The burden of proof for variances and appeals shall be upon the
applicant. The extent to which the following factors, standards, and criteria
apply to a specific case shall be determined by the Board.
            (1)    Factors applicable to area variances ("practical
difficulties"). The applicant shall show by a preponderance of the evidence
that the variance is justified, as determined by the Board. The Board shall
weigh the following factors to determine whether an area variance should be
granted:
                  A.    Whether the property in question will yield a
reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property
without the variance;
                  B.    Whether the variance is insubstantial;
                 C.    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood
would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
                  D.    Whether the variance would adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
                  E.    Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restrictions;
                  F.    Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can
be obviated through some method other than a variance; and/or
                  G.    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning
requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting a
variance.
            (2)    Standards applicable to use variances ("unnecessary
hardships"). The applicant shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence
that all of the following standards have been met in order to justify the
granting of a use variance, as determined by the Board:
         A.    The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         B.    The hardship condition is not created by actions of the
applicant;
          C.    The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the
rights of adjacent owners;
         D.    The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the
public health, safety or general welfare;
                 E.    The variance will be consistent with the general spirit
and intent of this Ordinance;
                  F.    The variance sought is the minimum which will afford
relief to the applicant; and
                  G.    There is no other economically viable use which is
permitted in the zoning district.
            (3)    Criteria applicable to appeals.  The Board shall reverse an
order of the Commission or a zoning official only if it finds that the action
or decision appealed:
                 A.    Was arbitrary or capricious; or
                  B.    Was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact;
or
                  C.    Was based on erroneous interpretation of this Ordinance
or zoning law; or
                  D.    Constituted an abuse of discretion.
            (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)

            (8)    Such other information concerning the lot or adjoining lots
as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of these regulations
will be complied with.
   (c)   Conformity with Applicable Ordinances and Approved Plans. A permit

other applicable laws and ordinances, except where the Zoning Officer receives
written notice of a variance having been granted by the Board.
   A permit issued on the basis of a site plan approved by the Commission shall
incorporate full compliance with the approved site plan as a condition of the
issuance of the permit. Modifications to an approved site plan shall be in
compliance with these regulations. Use, layout or construction at variance with
approved plans or application materials shall be deemed in violation of these
regulations, and subject to penalties in accordance with provisions outlined in
this Ordinance.
   
   (d)    Expiration of Permits. A permit issued pursuant to the provisions of
this Ordinance shall be consistent with the procedures stated within the
Building Code. Expiration and notification requirements of the applicable code
shall be followed.
   (e)   Inspection of Completed Work.  The holder of any permit issued
pursuant to the requirements of this section shall provide the Zoning Officer
with copies of all approvals and/or certificates of occupancy from the
designated Department of Building Standards and request a certificate of
occupancy upon completion of the work authorized by the permit and prior of
occupancy.
   
   (f)   Certificates of Completion. A Certificate of Completion shall be
required prior to occupancy or re-occupancy of any use of land, building or
structure. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to

occupation or re-occupation of any building or addition thereto, or part
thereof, for residential purposes until a Certificate of Completion has been
issued by the Zoning Officer. The following guidelines shall apply to
Certificates of Completion.
   
   (g)   Purpose of Certificates.  The purpose of a Certificate of Completion
is to permit the occupancy or use of land, buildings or structures. The
Certificate of Completion can be issued only upon the determination by the
Zoning Officer that the site is in compliance with the provisions of this
Ordinance, the Building Code, adopted Village engineering standards, and that
all outstanding Village fees or other charges have been paid.
   (h)   Certificates for New and Existing Buildings. Failure to obtain a
Certificate of Completion prior to commencing the use of property shall
constitute a violation of this Ordinance, subject to the penalties as outlined
herein.
   (i)   Temporary Certificates.  A temporary Certificate of Completion may be
issued by the Zoning Officer, for a portion of a building or structure prior to
occupancy of the entire building or structure, provided that such portion of
the building, structure or premises is in conformity with the provisions of
this Ordinance and other applicable regulations of the Village, and provided
further that no threat to public safety exists. A performance guarantee may be
required in accordance with provisions outlined in this Ordinance as a
condition of obtaining a temporary certificate. No temporary Certificate of
Completion shall be granted for a period in excess of six months. The date of
expiration shall be indicated on the temporary certificate; failure to obtain a
final Certificate of Completion within the specified time shall constitute a
violation of this Ordinance, subject to the penalties as outlined herein.
   
   (j)   Certificates for Accessory Buildings to Dwellings. Buildings and
structures that are accessory to a dwelling shall not require a separate

uses are shown on the plot plan and are completed at the same time as the
principal use.
   
   (k)   Period of Validity.  A final Certificate of Completion shall remain in
effect for the life of the building or structure, or part thereof, as long as
the specific operation conducted within the building or structure or use of the
land continues.
    (l)    Records of Certificates.  A record of all Certificates of Completion
shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Officer. Copies of such certificates
shall be furnished upon request to a person or persons having a proprietary or
tenancy interest in the property.
   
   (m)   Application Requirements. An application for a Certificate of
Completion shall be made on forms supplied by the Zoning Officer and must be
accompanied by the fees specified. A Certificate of Completion may be processed
concurrently with an application for a building permit, if a building permit is
required. The Zoning Officer shall determine if a non-residential occupancy
change requires site plan review and approval by the Commission pursuant to
this Ordinance.
   (n)   Issuance of Certificate. The Zoning Officer shall issue a Certificate
of Completion upon notification by an applicant of the completion of a building
or structure or other improvements and upon finding that the building or
structure, or part thereof, or the use of land conforms with an approved site
plan and the provisions of this Ordinance. If the request for a Certificate of
Completion is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial
and the reasons for denial. (Ord. 21-2020. Passed 12-14-20.)
1149.11 FEES.
      Any application for an amendment to this Ordinance, site plan review,
review of a conditional land use proposal, review of a planned development
proposal, request for a variance, request for inspection, request for a
building or zoning permit, request for a Certificate of Completion, or other
request for other action pursuant to the regulations set forth in this
Ordinance shall be subject to and accompanied by a fee as established by the
Council. Such fees, including any outside consultant fees and all
administrative and legal costs pertaining to the review and processing of any
application, shall be collected in advance of any reviews, inspections or
issuance of any permits or approvals. Upon notification of deficient payment of
fees, the Zoning Officer shall cause any permits to be suspended and reject
applications for new permits directly associated with the project. The
assessment and payment of application fees does not affect the requirements for
a performance guarantee as specified in this Ordinance. There shall be no fee
in the case of applications filed in the public interest by a municipal
department or Village official.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective July 1, 2009, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

subsection (b) hereof, the owner may be prosecuted and is subject to the
penalty provided in Section
1301.99 .

   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans

      (Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.02 DANGEROUS BUILDINGS; NUISANCES.
   As used in this chapter, all dangerous buildings within the terms of Section
1311.01 are hereby declared and shall be deemed to be public nuisances by
reason of the condition in which the same are permitted to remain, in any one
or more of the following particulars:
   (a)   By reason of being a nuisance to the general health of the community.
   (b)   By reason of being a fire hazard.
   (c)   By reason of being unsafe for occupancy or use on, in, upon, about or

   (d)   By reason of being a nuisance, because of long-continued vacancy, lack
of reasonable or adequate maintenance of the structure and/or premises adjacent
thereto, thereby depreciating the enjoyment and use of property in the
immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is harmful to the community in
which such structure is situated.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.03 AGREEMENT TO REPAIR OR REMOVE.
   The record title holders and lienholders of the property may enter into an

building.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.04 AUTHORITY TO EXAMINE PREMISES; REMEDIAL ORDER.
   (a)   The Building Official, or a person delegated by him, shall be
empowered to examine or cause to be examined any building or dwelling within
the Municipality, to determine whether such building or dwelling is dangerous,
unsafe or constitutes a nuisance, as provided by this chapter, and may apply to
a court of competent jurisdiction for an administrative search warrant to enter
said premises for inspection.
   (b)   The Building Official shall examine or cause to be examined every
building or structure or portion thereof reported or believed to be a dangerous
building. Unless another deadline is established under this chapter, the owner
shall comply with the notice of violation within thirty (30) days. The Building

of the property by personal service or by regular First Class U.S. Mail and
shall post signs on the dangerous building in accordance with Section
1311.05 of the Building Official’s intent to repair or remove the building. If
any emergency exists, notice may be given by the above means fifteen (15) days
prior to repair or removal.
   If personal service is not obtained and the notice of violation is returned
as undeliverable by the USPS, the Building Official shall cause the notice of
violation to be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Municipality. The publication shall be published at least once a week for
four (4) consecutive weeks and shall contain the name, address, and phone
number of the office of the Building Official, the address of the dangerous
building, the name and last known address of the owner of the dangerous
building, a summary statement that the building has been determined to be
dangerous and that the building must be repaired or removed, and that the owner
is required to contact the Building Official and comply with the notice of
violation within fifteen (15) days after the last date of publication.
   The Building Official may grant an extension of time for compliance with the
notice of violation upon the owner’s written request and for good cause shown.
   (c)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling unit or structure
who has received a notice pursuant to paragraph (b), or whom a notice of
violation has been served, to sell, transfer, lease, mortgage or otherwise
dispose of property to another until the provisions of the notice of violation
have been complied with, or until such owner shall first furnish the grantee,
transferee, mortgagee, or lessee with such notice of violation issued by the
Building Official and furnish the Building Official with a signed and notarized
statement from the grantee, transferee, mortgagee, or lessee, acknowledging the
receipt of such notice of violation and fully accepting the responsibility,
without condition, for making the corrections or repairs required by such
notice of violation.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.05 POSTING OF SIGNS.
   The Building Official shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such
building or structure or portion thereof a notice reading: “DO NOT ENTER.
UNSAFE TO OCCUPY. BUILDING OFFICIAL, VILLAGE OF PENINSULA, OHIO”. Such notice
shall include the date of posting and a deadline as established in Section
1311.04(b) of this Code. Such notice shall remain posted until the required
repairs are made or demolition is completed. It shall be unlawful for any
person to remove such notice without permission of the Building Official or for
any person to enter the building, except for the purpose of making the required
repairs or demolishing the same.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.06 PERMITS.

Official, permits covering such work shall be obtained as required.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)

rehabilitate or demolish and remove said building or structure, or portion
thereof, such party, either the owenr of record of the purchaser under land
contract, shall be subject to the penal provisions of this Building Code, and
the Building Official shall proceed to have the building or structure, or
portion thereof, demolished and removed from the premises, leaving the premises
in a clean, safe and sanitary condition, at the Municipality’s costs. If the
Municipality is not immediately reimbursed for such costs, the “total cost” as
defined in Ohio R.C. 715.261(A) shall be collected as provided in Ohio R.C.
715.261(B)(1) or (2).
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.075 HISTORIC REVIEW BEFORE DEMOLITION.
   (a)   Before any order for demolition is issued or any permit to demolish a
structure is granted for any structure that is more than 100 years old or is
located within the Village’s Historic District, the demolition order or request
must first be referred to the Planning Commission for a historic review of the
structure.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall then have up to 60 days from the date of
the referral to determine whether the structure is historically significant.
The Planning Commission may engage the assistance of organizations with
expertise in this area to assist it in making its determination.
   (c)   If the Planning Commission finds that the structure is not
historically significant, then the demolition order may be enforced or the
demolition permit may be granted.
   (d)   In the event that the Planning Commission finds that the structure is
historically significant, the Planning Commission may issue a determination
that the demolition of the structure be delayed for up to an additional 180
days, or a longer period with the agreement of the property owner, to permit
the exploration of preservation alternatives, such as: designating the
structure as a historic landmark, finding a purchaser who may be interested in
rehabilitating the structure, raising money to rehabilitate the structure, or
finding alternate sites for the proposed post-demolition project.   
   (e)   In making its determination that the structure is historically
significant, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors: (1)
the structure’s architectural and design significance; (2) whether the building
is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, Village,
or region; (3) whether the structure has historical events or persons
associated with it, and (4) the condition of the structure.
   (f)   The structure may be demolished at any time within or after the
additional 180 day period specified in paragraph (d) hereof if the Planning
Commission determines that, despite the structure’s historical significance,
there are no feasible alternatives to demolition. Factors to be considered in
making a no feasible alternatives determination are the following: (1)
realistic alternatives (including adaptive uses) are not likely because of the
nature or cost of the work necessary to preserve the structure; (2) after a
bona fide, reasonable effort, a purchaser for the structure or rehabilitation
solution that will result in the preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration
of the structure cannot be found; (3) economic hardship on the part of the
property owner, making delaying the demolition request unreasonable; (4) the
property is an imminent and substantial danger to the health and/or safety of
the public due to its deteriorating condition; and (5) the structure has been
burned or damaged by an event beyond the property owner’s control with more
than 50% of the structure affected.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.08 UNSAFE CONDITIONS; REPORTS.
   Any owner, manager, lessee, or occupant of a building who discovers or who
has reason to believe that there exists on the premises a condition that may
endanger other property or the life or limb of any person, and such condition
cannot be immediately remedied so as to remove any danger therefrom, shall,
within twenty-four hours of such discover, report the existence of such
dangerous condition to the Building Official, who shall forthwith take such
steps as may be necessary to protect the public safety and welfare. If the
Building Official cannot be located, such report shall be made to the Mayor. No
person who is an owner, manager, lessee or occupant of a building on which
premises such a dangerous condition exists and who knows of such dangerous
condition shall fail to make such report to either the Building Official or
Mayor within twenty-four hours after such knowledge is obtained.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.09 FAILURE TO ACT; REMEDY BY VILLAGE; COSTS CERTIFIED AS A LIEN.
   Any and all costs incurred under this chapter shall be paid by the owner of
such building or structure. The owner shall reimburse the Municipality for all
expenses, including but not limited to the cost of securing, boarding,
vacating, repairing or demolishing the dangerous building.
   If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the Building Official
within the time limit specified in such order, the Building Official shall
cause such building to be secured, effectively boarded, vacated, repaired or
demolished, as the facts may warrant, under the standards provided for in this
chapter. Council, with the assistance of the Building Official, shall cause the
costs of such securing, boarding, vacating, repair, or demolition, including
the costs of service or publication of notice, to be certified to the Village
Fiscal Officer, who shall certify the aforesaid costs to the County Fiscal
Officer, together with the proper description of the premises for placing the
same on the tax duplicate, together with all interest and penalties allowed by
law. From the date of entry, a lien shall vest on the premises in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   Notwithstanding the power and authority to certify a lien set forth in this
section, nothing shall abrogate nor limit any other rigth of recovery the
Municipality may have. The Solicitor shall take any action necessary to collect
the costs incurred under this chapter from the owner or other responsible
party.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Building Official has full authority to apply for warrants, issue
orders, compel repair or demolition, and any other act called for by this
chapter.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.11 APPEAL TO BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (a)   Any owner, manger, lessee, or occupant of a building who has received
an order from the Building Official to repair or demolish a structure under
this chapter, may appeal that order within ten (10) days of receipt of notice
of such order to the Board of Zoning Appeals by filing a written notice of
appeal stating the reasons for the appeal and including an appeal fee of
$350.00. In lieu of including the $350.00 appeal fee, appellees claiming that
the payment of the appeal fee would constitute a hardship may include a written
request for all or part of the appeal fee to be waived. Such request shall
include a written explanation supporting that hardship status request. In the
event a request to waive the appeal fee is made, the Board shall schedule a
hearing on the issue of the appeal fee as soon as practicable. If the appeal
fee is waived in its entirety by the Board, the Board shall schedule the appeal
of the Building Official’s order pursuant to this chapter for a hearing before
the Board pursuant to subsection ( b) of this section. In the event the Board
determines the appeal fee should not be waived or decides a reduced fee amount
should be paid, the appellee shall have ten days from the date of notification
of the Board’s appeal fee determination to pay the fee or reduced fee,
whichever is applicable. Once the appeal fee is paid, the appeal of the
Building Official’s order shall be scheduled for a hearing before the Board
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
   
   (b)   Upon receipt of an appeal commenced under Section
1311.11(a), the Board of Zoning Appeals shall cause a meeting for the hearing
of the appeal to be scheduled.
   (c)   On any appeal filed under Section
1311.11(a), the Board of Zoning Appeals may modify, reverse, or affirm the
decision of the Building Official. All appeals shall be considered do novo.
   (d)   All appeals initiated under Section
1311.11(a) shall be filed in writing with the Village Administrative Clerk, who
shall promptly forward the appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Upon the
submission of an appeal under this section, all orders of the Building Official
shall be stayed, unless the Building Official certifies in writing that the
order is in response to an emergency situation necessary for the immediate
preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.12 STRUCTURES VACANT AND OPEN ENTRY.
   (a)   Legislative Findings. Council finds that structures that are vacant
and open to entry at doors, windows or other points accessible to the general
public:
      (1)   Attract children to enter;
      (2)   Become a harborage for vermin;
      (3)   Serve as a temporary abode for vagrants and criminals;
      (4)   Are likely to be damaged by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists;
      (5)   Often become dilapidated because they are not repaired by the
owners or persons in control of the structures;
      (6)   Depress the market value of surrounding properties; and
      (7)   Invite the dumping of garbage and rubbish thereupon.
   (b)   Building Official to Secure. Whenever the Building Official finds a
vacant structure open to entry at doors, windows or other points accessible to
the general public, the Official may cause the structure to be secured at those
points of entry. The Building Official shall be authorized at any time to enter
upon the premises and secure the structure in order to lessen the severity of
risk caused by the dangerous building. In securing such structure, the Building
Official may call upon any department of the Municipality or whatever
assistance may be necessary, and may, by private contract, secure such
structure. Such securing shall not be deemed to constitute effective boarding
pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, and shall not abate the necessity to repair
or remove the dangerous building. The notice of violation shall include the
fact that the Building Official has found it necessary to take appropriate
action to secure the structure.
   (c)   Effective Boarding Pending Repair or Removal.
      (1)   Materials. The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but
not be limited to doors, windows or other areas of the structure open to
ingress or egress and to weather elements at any and all levels of the
structure. Such opening shall be secured by plywood, not less than one-half
inch thick, or other materials of equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of forty-eight inches wide shall be framed by two
inches on center onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be
fastened into the openings by screw type nail or lag screws.
      (2)   Maintenance. Upon effectively boarding the structure, the owner
shall monitor and maintain the structure and its surrounding premises in a
safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any portion of the exterior structure
that is deemed to be potentially hazardous due to deteriorated conditions or it
being structurally unsound shall be removed or treated in such a manner so as
to eliminate the hazard. The exterior premises shall be maintained free from
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles, and conditions that may provide harborage
for rodents. Failure of the owner to properly maintain the building in the
above condition will result in the structure being deemed a public nuisance and
scheduled for repair or removal.
      (3)   Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation shall commence on a time table
approved by the Building Official. If rehabilitation of the effectively boarded
building does not commence on the approved time table or if the permits are
otherwise invalidated or revoked, then the Building Official may declare that
the nuisance has not been abated and schedule the structure for repair or
removal.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)
1311.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any owner of any dangerous building who fails to comply with any
notice or order to repair, vacate, or demolish such building, given by any
person authorized to give such notice or order, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree for each offense. Each day of noncompliance
with this chapter shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)   Any owner of a dangerous building who sells, transfers, mortgages,
leases or otherwise disposes of property to another without compliance with
Section
1311.04(c) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (c)   Any occupant or lessee in possession who fails to comply with any
notice to vacate and who fails to repair such building in accordance with any
notice given as provided in this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of
the second degree for each offense. Each day of noncompliance with this chapter
shall constitute a separate offense.
   (d)   Whoever violates Section
1311.05 of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree
for each offense. Each day of noncompliance with this chapter shall constitute
a separate offense.
   (e)   Whoever demolishes a building without having a permit to do so or
without permitting the historical review process provided for in Section
1311.075 to take place shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.
(Ord. 7-2016. Passed 8-8-16.)

1321.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   Village Flood Hazard Areas. The flood hazard areas of Village of
Peninsula are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect
of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights
and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas.
Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 80-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)
1321.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)    Protect human life and health;
   (b)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight
areas;
   (g)    Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and,
   (h)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
      (Ord. 80-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)
1321.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplain, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

      (Ord. 80-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)
1321.05 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special . flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Peninsula as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development referenced in subsection (b)
hereof, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Peninsula.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency [FEMA] in a scientific and engineering study entitled Flood Insurance
Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, effective July 20, 2009. This
study, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas effective July 20, 2009, and any revisions thereto is hereby
adopted by reference as part of these regulations. The study is on file at the
Peninsula Town Hall, 1582 Main Street, Peninsula, Ohio, 44264.
   (c)   Compliance. Unless specifically exempted from filing for a development
permit as stated in Section
1321.06(b), no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction.
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (f)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village of Peninsula, any of its officers or employees, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (g)   Violation and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a minor
misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any
of its requirements (including violations of conditions of and safeguards
established in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be
fined in an amount not to exceed $100.00. Each day such a violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Village of Peninsula from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violations. The Village of Peninsula shall prosecute
any violation of this chapter in accordance with the penalties stated herein.
   (h)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 80-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)
1321.06 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be
obtained from the Director of the Summit County Building Inspection Department
before construction or development begins within any area of special flood
hazard established in Section
1321.05 (b). Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Village of Peninsula and may include, but not be limited to:
plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
Specifically, the following information is required if base flood elevation
data are available:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard
areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
nonresidential structure will be flood proofed in accordance with Section
1321.07(b)(2)A.;
      (3)    Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the flood proofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the flood
proofing criteria in Section
1321.07(b)(2)A. where base flood elevation data are utilized from any source;
      (4)    Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or    relocated as a result of proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished;
      (5)    Certification by a registered professional engineer, architect, or
surveyor of the structure's as-built lowest floor or flood proofed elevation.
   (b)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
Development Permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small development activities (except for
filing and grading) valued at less than $1,000.00.
   (c)   Designation of the Floodplain Management Chapter Administrator. The
Director of the Summit County Building Inspection Department is hereby
appointed to act as the Floodplain Management Chapter Administrator
(hereinafter "Administrator") and to administer and implement this chapter by
granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
   (d)   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Management Chapter
Administrator. The duties and responsibilities shall include but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Permit review.
         A.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those federal, state, or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by
the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
         C.   Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are
delineated in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate
Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a
1321.07(c)(1) is met.
         D.   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1321.05 (b) are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map). Within these areas, the Administrator shall
obtain, review and reasonable utilize any base flood elevation and floodway
data available from a Federal, State, or other source, in order to administer
Sections
1321.07 (b)(1) and (2), and (c) hereof.
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained.  Where base flood
elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data,
the following provisions apply:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain an enclosure
below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved flood proofed
nonresidential structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was flood proofed; and,
            2.   Maintain the flood proofmg certification required in
subsection (a)(3) hereof.
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.  
         A.   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Divisions of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
         B.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
         C.   Maintain engineering documentation required in subsection (a)(4)
hereof that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and
elevation disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
subsection (e) hereof.
      (6)   Alteration of community boundaries. Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of the Village of Peninsula have been modified
by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer
has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a
particular area. In order that the Village of Peninsula's Flood Insurance Rate
Map accurately represent the Village of Peninsula's boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the Village of Peninsula suitable for
reproduction clearly delineating the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the Village of Peninsula has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (e)   Variance Procedure.
      (1)   Appeal Board.
         A.   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests
for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
         B.   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
         C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals, or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Ohio R.C. §2506 et seq.
         D.   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         E.   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
1321.06(e)(1)D. and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purpose of this chapter.
         F.   The Board of Appeals shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
      (2)   Conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances may only be issued where due to physical
characteristics of the property compliance with the requirements of this
chapter creates an exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of
meeting the requirements of this chapter do not constitute an exceptional
hardship.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing items 1. to 11. in Section
1321.06(e)(1)D. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
         C.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         E.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is a minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         F.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, case fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
Section
1321.06(e)(1)D. herein, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         G.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to build with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
            (Ord. 80-2009. Passed 6-8-09.)
1321.07 PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.

shall either have the lowest floor including basement, elevated to the level of
the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         A.   Be flood proofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to a level at or above the
base flood elevation. In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates,
the structure should be flood proofed at least one foot above the base flood
elevation;
         B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and,
         C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1321.06(a)(3).
      (3)   Accessory structures. An exemption to the elevation or dry flood
proofing standards may be granted for accessory structures (e.g., sheds,
detached garages) containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area. Such
structures must meet the encroachment provisions of Section
1321.07 (c)(1) and the following additional standards:
         A.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
         B.   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
         C.   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as
to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         D.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
         E.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or flood proofed; and,
         F.   They shall meet the opening requirements of Section
1321.07(b)(5).
      (4)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. The following
standards shall apply to all new and substantially-improved manufactured homes
not subject to the manufactured home requirements of Ohio R.C. 3773.01. These
standards shall also apply to all recreational vehicles that are either located
on sites for 180 days or more, or are not fully licensed and ready for highway
use.
         A.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with Section
1321.07(a)(1)B.
         B.   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation.
      (5)   Enclosures below the lowest floor.  The following provisions apply
to all new and substantially-improved residential and nonresidential non-
basement structures which are elevated to the base flood elevation using
pilings, columns, posts, or. solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood waters. These structures may
enclose the area below the base flood elevation provided the following
conditions are met:
         A.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement
must:
            1.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, or
            2.   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area shall be
provided;
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and,
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
         B.   Any enclosure which meets these criteria shall be considered as
having met their requirements of Section
1321.07(a)(1).
   (c)   Floodways. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than one foot. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential. The Flood fusurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map) does not
designate a floodway. However, floodways may be delineated in other available
sources of flood information as specified in Section
1321.06 (d)(2). The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that a proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)    If subsection (c)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1321.07.
      (3)    Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Clerk-Treasurer of the Village of Peninsula to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and must meet the requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
