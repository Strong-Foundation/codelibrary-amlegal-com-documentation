of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF WOODSFIELD,

filed with the permanent records of the Village of Woodsfield, Ohio.
   SECTION II: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section IV of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof

the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

residents of the Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation
and avoid practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1) and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

of Council may consider among other matters:

      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the village office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If
it is not clear what records are being sought, a member of the village office
or Records Commission must contact the requester in order to have them revise
their request specifying the manner or order by which the village maintains or
files its records.
      (2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
public record.
      (3)   If a request is for records that may be exempt or prohibited from
disclosure, or if the request presents a high probability of litigation or any
other unique issue; the Fiscal Officer, Mayor’s Secretary, or member of the
Records Commission must contact the Village Solicitor as the request is being
processed.
      (4)   Copies of public record must be made available within a reasonable
period of time. The term “reasonable” takes into account the volume of records
requested, the proximity of location where records are stored, and the
necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
      (5)   Each request should be elevated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records, such as copies of
Ordinances or applications, should be satisfied immediately if feasible to do
so. If fewer than 10 pages are requested or if the records are readily
available in an electronic format that can be easily emailed, these should be
made available as quickly as equipment allows.
      (6)   All reasonable requests for public records must be satisfied or by
acknowledged in writing within three business days following the office’s
receipts of the request.
      (7)   In processing the request, the Village of Woodsfield does not have
an obligation to create new records or perform new analysis of existing
information.
   (f)   Denial or Redaction of a Request.
      (1)   If the requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty making a request for public records, the request may be denied, but
the denial must provide the requester an opportunity to revise the request by
informing the requester of the manner in which records are maintained and
assessed by the village.
      (2)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If the initial request was made in writing, the
explanation must also be in writing.
      (3)   If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the
exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released.
      (4)   All redactions shall be plainly visible. If there are redactions,
each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation, including
authority.
   (g)   Compliance. With any public records, the Public Records Custodian or
such designee reserves the right to consult with legal counsel prior to the
release of such public records. This is to allow the Village of Woodsfield to
comply with laws prohibiting release of certain records.
   (h)   Copying and Mailing Costs:
      (1)   Those seeking public records may be charged only the actual cost of
making copies, not labor.
      (2)   Copies on letter size paper, black ink only, are $0.25 (twenty-five
cents) single-sided copy.
      (3)   Copies on legal size paper, black ink only, are $0.45 (forty-five
cents) single-sided copy.
      (4)   Copies requiring color ink will be charged double the black ink
rate.
      (5)   Copies requested on a compact disc (CD) will be $2.00 (two
dollars).
      (6)   Copies requested on a USB flash drive will be charged the actual
cost of the flash drive.
      (7)   Requesters may not provide their own materials for copying, in
order to avoid compromise of the Village’s system either in security or use of
inferior materials that may nullify any warranty.
   (i)   Public Access to Information.
      (1)   The Village of Woodsfield Records Commission shall establish a
Records Retention Schedule, which will remain available for inspection at the
Woodsfield Municipal Building. Also available with the Village of Woodsfield
Public Record Policy. Employees of the village will be advised of such
availability.
      (2)   The Village of Woodsfield will continue to update and address all
education, training, disclosure, and policy requirements mandated by ORC 109.43
(E)(1)(2).

151.01 HOLIDAYS.
   (a)   In addition to the normal and regular vacation schedule, the following
days are declared to be legal holidays: New Year’s Day, Good Friday, Memorial
Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, and the day
after thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve, and any other
mentioned day approved by the Council.
   (b)   Each full-time employee of the Village, except for the Police and
Voluntary Fire Department employees shall be granted compensation, either in
wages or in compensatory time, for any or all of these legal holidays the
employee is required to work, as determined by the following schedule:
      (1)   Salaried Employees. If any or all of these ten (10) legal holidays
falls on the regularly scheduled work day for a full-time, salaried employee,
except Police and Voluntary Fire Department, is required to work eight (8) or
more consecutive hours on that legal holiday, the salaried employees shall be
granted compensatory time of one day for each legal holiday worked, by having
one day for each legal holiday worked added to his normal vacation schedule.
      (2)   In the event any or all of the ten (10) legal holidays set out in
this section fall on a Saturday, the holiday shall be observed on the Friday
preceding the holiday date. In the event any or all of the ten (10) legal
holidays set out in this section fall on a Sunday, the holiday shall be
observed on Monday following the holiday date.
      (3)   Work Holiday Period. For purposes of determining a work holiday
period, a work day shall consist of eight (8) consecutive hours in the period
from midnight to midnight.
      (4)   Cash Payments. The Treasurer is authorized to pay, upon
certification by the Mayor as to the amounts of each employee, cash in lieu of
compensatory time for all full-time employees in the Police and Voluntary-Fire
Departments, (Department Head excluded) entitled to ten (10) paid holidays as
provided in this section and set forth below:
         Compensation for employees shall be paid in any pay period in which
the holiday falls.
   (c)   Employees required to work on a holiday shall receive one and a half
times their hourly rate (1 ½) for all hours actually worked, plus eight hours
holiday pay.
   (d)   Employees must work the day before and the day following a Holiday in
order to be paid for said Holiday. Acceptable hours are; regular, Personal,

(Ord. 1287-2020. Passed 11-16-20.)
151.02 VACATION.
   (a)   Each employee of the Village shall be entitled to vacation, pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 124.13.

and sick leave earned at the rate established by Ohio R.C. Chapter 124.
   (c)   Each employee of the Village shall be entitled to earn sick leave only
on his regular hours and shall not be entitled to accumulate or earn sick leave
on overtime.

section shall be null and void and of no effect. (Ord. 909-95. Passed 11-6-95.)
151.03 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Sick Leave is a fringe benefit privilege and is very similar to
insurance in that it is designed to prevent you from suffering economic
hardship by providing you with your usual rate of compensation during periods
of incapacity. Sick Leave, life insurance, is a protection in case of need and
not a benefit to be used whenever you, as an employee, would like to take a day
off.
   (b)   Each full-time employee of the Village shall be entitled for each
complete hour of service to sick leave of .0575 hours, a total of four and six-
tenths (4 6/10) hour for each eighty (80) hours of service. Each employee may
use sick leave upon approval of the responsible Supervisor for absence due to
personal illness, pregnancy, injury, exposure to contagious disease which could
be communicated to other employees, and illness or death in the employee’s
immediate family, provided, however, that absence due to death or illness in
the family shall be limited to three working days unless further absence is
approved by the Department Head or Mayor on receipt of a request in writing for
such an extension. Immediate family defined as only; spouse, parent or legal
guardian, child or foster child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild,
mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law and
sister-in-law.
   (c)   Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without limit. When sick leave
is used, it shall be deducted from the employee’s credit on the basis of one
(1) hour for every one (1) hour of absence from previously scheduled you work.
   (d)   The responsible Supervisor shall require an employee to furnish a
satisfactory written, signed statement to justify the use of sick leave. If
medical attention is required, a certificate stating the nature of the illness
and that you are physically fit to return to work from a licensed physician
shall be required to justify the use of sick leave. Falsification of either a
written signed statement, or a physician’s certificate shall be grounds for
disciplinary action, including dismissal.
   (e)   This section shall not be construed to interfere with existing unused
sick leave credit where attendance records have been maintained and credit has
been given employees for unused sick leave.
   (f)   Sick Leave will accrue based upon these hours; regular, overtime,
holiday, sick, and vacation only, with a maximum of 120 hours per calendar
year.
(Ord. 1287-2020. Passed 11-16-20.)
151.04 HEALTH, ACCIDENT AND LIFE INSURANCE.
   The Village shall provide for health, accident and life insurance for every
nonelected employee of the Village according to the terms of the contract on
file at the Municipal Building. (Ord. 208. Passed 4-20-70.)
151.05 WORK WEEK.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: See Section
143.06 for law enforcement officers work week schedule.)
   Forty hours shall be standard work week for employees paid at an hourly

Reversion Recall List and shall have no further rights to reemployment under
this subsection (c)(2).

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R. C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a
jury at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State. ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): “Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.”
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): “Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date.”
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

   (b)    Where a person conducts a business both within and outside the
Municipality, the portion of the entire net profits of such business to be
allocated as having been made within the Municipality may be determined from
the records of such business, if such business has bona fide records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profits is
attributable to that part of its activities conducted within the Municipality
or at the option of the taxpayer may be determined by the following formula,
which shall be used if taxpayer has no bona fide records showing net profits

         D.    Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
paragraphs A., B. and C. hereof or such of the aforesaid percentages as are

Commissioner a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under the formula
provided for herein, the Board of Review, upon application of the taxpayer or
the Tax Commissioner, shall, under uniform regulations adopted by the Board,
have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect
a fair and proper allocation.
   (c)    (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable
year, beginning with the year 1974 allocable to the Municipality, may be
applied against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years, allocable to
the Municipality, until exhausted, but in no event for more than the five
taxable years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No
portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of
any: prior year.
      (2)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be allocated
to the Municipality in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net

require such information, in addition to the return hereinafter provided for,
as he may deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly
allocated to the Municipality. If the Tax Commissioner finds net profits are
not properly allocated to the Municipality by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, he may require the filing of a
consolidated return or adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and
proper allocation of net profits to the Municipality. (Ord.272. Passed 7-15-

profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other

181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    Each employer within, or doing business within, the Municipality, who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation
basis shall deduct at the time of the payment of such salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation, the tax of one percent (1%) of the gross
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by such employer to each
employee and shall, on or before the last day of April, July, October and
January of each year, after the effective date of this chapter, make a return
and pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted during the
preceding calendar quarter. Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed
by or acceptable to the Tax Commissioner and shall be subject to the rules and
regulations prescribed therefor by the Tax Commissioner.
 
   (b)    Each employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality, as a trustee
for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such tax collected by such
employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Municipality,
be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
 
   (c)    It shall be the responsibility, jointly and severally, of the
president and treasurer of each corporation required to withhold the tax from
wages of its employees under this section, to see that all such taxes so
withheld are paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld by a corporation from the salaries of its
employees are not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of
this section, the president and treasurer of such corporation shall each be
criminally liable under the provisions of Section
181.99.
 
   (d)    On or before April 30 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return, on a form or forms prescribed by and obtainable from the
Tax Commissioner, setting forth the names and addresses of all employees from
whose compensation the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year, and
the amount of tax withheld from the listed employees and such other information
as may be required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Tax
Commissioner.
 
   (e)    Provided, however, that no person shall be required to withhold the
tax on the wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed
exclusively in or about such person's residence. However, such domestic
servants shall be responsible for filing and paying their own returns and
taxes.
(Ord. 288. Passed 9-22-75.)
181.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated
profit or loss from such business activity together with the estimated tax due
thereon, if any.
   (b)    (1)    Beginning with the year 1974; the first declaration hereunder
shall be filed on or before January 31, 1975, of such year or within four
months of the date the taxpayer first becomes subject to the provisions of this
section; in 1975 and succeeding years, such declaration shall be filed on or
before April 30 of each year during the life of the chapter, or within four
months of the date the taxpayer first becomes subject to the provisions of this
section.
      (2)    Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)    (1)    Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Commissioner. Credit shall be taken in such declaration
for the income tax to be withheld from any portion of such income and for
income taxes to be paid to another taxing municipality for which credit is
allowed against Woodsfield tax under Section
181.14.
      (2)    Except as hereinafter specified, a declaration of estimated tax to
be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least one-
fourth of the estimated tax, less credit for taxes withheld or paid to another
municipality, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last
day of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the beginning of the tax
year; provided, however, that the first and final payment of such estimated tax
for the applicable portion of the calendar year 1974 is payable on or before
the last day of January, 1975.
      (3)    A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however that
in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (d)    An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31, of any
year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulation of the Tax Commissioner, if it appears that
the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer's
income by thirty percent (30%) or more. At such time a payment which, together
with prior payments, is sufficient to pay taxpayer's entire estimated
liability, shall be made. If upon the filing of the return, on or before
January 31, or the date fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the
difference between seventy percent (70%) of the taxpayer's tax liability and
the amount of estimated tax he actually paid on or before January 31, or the
date fixed by regulation whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the
interest and penalty provisions of Section
181.10.
 
   (e)    On or before the last day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which the declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the Municipality shall
be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
181.05. (Ord. 272. Passed 7-15-74.)
181.08 DUTIES OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER.

declaration or make any return, including a return of taxes withheld, and to
show the dates and amount of payments thereof.
   (c)    The Tax Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of

thing pertaining to the collection and payment of taxes and the administration
and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the
re-examination and correction of returns.
   (d)    In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax Commissioner
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Municipality from the
taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount
of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (e)    Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulation approved by the Board of Review, the Tax Commissioner shall have the
power to compromise any liability imposed by this chapter. (Ord. 272. Passed 7-

returns of any employer, or taxpayer, or any person subject to, or whom the Tax
Commissioner believes is subject to the provisions of this chapter, for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax or withholdings due under this chapter. Every such
employer, supposed employer, taxpayer, or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed
and required to furnish, upon written request of the Tax Commissioner, or his
duly authorized agent or employee, the means, facilities, and opportunity for
making such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to order any person,
presumed to have knowledge of the facts, to appear at the office of the Tax
Commissioner and to examine such person, under oath, concerning any income
which was or should have been returned for taxation, or withheld, or any
transaction tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may compel the
production of books, papers, records and federal income tax returns, and the
attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever
he believes such persons have knowledge of such income or information pertinent
to such inquiry.
   (c)    The refusal to produce books, papers, records and federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person
subject, or presumed to be subject, to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Tax Commissioner authorized hereby shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter punishable as provided in Section
181.99.

thousand dollars ($5,000) and imprisoned not more than six months, or both, for

that a resident, working in another municipality imposing a tax on earned
income shall not be required to file a declaration under Section

are the resident’s only income taxable under this chapter.

in a comparable context in laws of the United States relating to federal income
taxation or in Title LVII of the ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly

in these rules and regs is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the
United States relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the ORC and

States relating to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in
Title LVII of the ORC.

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
         (a)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)   Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (ii)    Division (C)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (e)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income;
         (f)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated

(iv) of this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
            (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (C)
(1)(h) of this section to offset qualifying wages.

division (C)(1)(h)(i) of this section.
               (b)    For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a

   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location;
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
183.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(D)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section. all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
183.04 of this Chapter.

   (A)   (1)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in this Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in this municipality.
Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
183.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section,
the tax shall be withheld at the rate, specified in Section
183.03 of these rules and regs, of one percent (1%). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this division, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident. This shall be
considered to be a "courtesy withholding".
   
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of this Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted

required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of this Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of this Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded
two hundred dollars ($200.00).
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days
after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of this municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and
this Municipality as the return required of a non-resident employee whose sole
income subject to the tax under these rules and regs is the qualifying wages
reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold this Municipality income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under these rules and regs or by the employer's, agent's, or
other payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to this Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to this
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for this Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:

employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for this Municipality during the preceding calendar year;

calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
Further, the liquidation, bankruptcy, and reorganization such as merger,
consolidation, acquisition, transfer or change in identity, form or
organization does not discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns
or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold this Municipality
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by these rules and regs, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section.
      (12)    A person who employs domestic help for such person's private
residence shall not be considered an employer of the domestic for municipal
income tax withholding purposes, and shall not be required to withhold and/or
remit municipal income tax on behalf of the domestic help.
      (13)    Overwithholding of former employees:
         (a)    If the overwithholding is discovered in the same month, the
employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the employee and the
amount to be reported on the Employer's Municipal Tax Withholding Statement
(Form 11) as withheld shall be the corrected amount.
         (b)    If the overwithholding is discovered in a subsequent month of
the same calendar year, the employer may make proper adjustment with the
employee. In such case, the Employer's Municipal Tax Withholding Statement for
the month in which the adjustment is made shall reflect the total amount
actually withheld for the month and the amount of the adjustment deducted
therefrom. Also, an amended Form 11 must be filed for the month in which the
error occurred reflecting the adjustment.
         (c)    If the overwithholding is discovered in a subsequent month of
the following calendar year, the employee must make and file a request for a
refund. This request is to be filed on a form prescribed by and obtainable from
the Tax Administrator.
      (14)   Overwithholding of former Employees:
         (a)    In the cases where an amount in excess of the tax has been
withheld from an employee who is no longer employed by the employer, the Tax
Administrator shall refund the amount of such excess withholding to the
employer.
         (b)    If the error is discovered by the employee, such employee shall
file a claim with the Tax Administrator and upon verification thereof by the
employer, the Tax Administrator shall refund the amount of such excess
withholding to the employee.

to be deducted is withheld from the employee and is discovered in the same
year, such deficiency shall be withheld from subsequent wages. If the employee/
employer relationship has terminated, or if the underwithholding is discovered
in a later year and the employee/employer relationship still exists, the
employer shall notify the Administrator of such deficiency and the reason
therefore, and payment shall be made by the employer in conformity with this
section of these rules and regulations.

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
lf the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by this municipality in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of this Municipality.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of this
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the ORC and any rules adopted
pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, each video lottery
terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of this Municipality in which the facility is located indicating
the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The
video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the 31st day of January, a video lottery
sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video lottery
sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall
provide to the Tax Administrator of this municipality a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are inunediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent (50%) of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not
filed or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and
withheld at the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the ORC.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by this
Municipality and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of section 718.08
of the ORC. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.
      (Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)

   (A)    An annual Municipality income tax return shall be completed and filed
by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to
the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon. (Ord. 16-2023. Passed 12-28-23.)
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
183.04 of these rules and regs when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due this
municipality.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for this municipality
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from

receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to this Municipality, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
ordinance/chapter.

person or property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    This Municipality shall permit spouses to file a joint return. Both
spouses are liable jointly and severally for payment of the tax associated with
the joint return. A tax return shall be deemed a joint return whenever the
facts indicate that the taxpayers intended to have the filed tax return be a
joint return. Conclusive indications of such intention include when both
spouses have signed the tax return, when the return reports both spouses'
income, or when the return reports both spouses' income but only one signed the
return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of

taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for
anymunicipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040;
and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary
to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form ll20F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by this Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)
   (G)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in these rules and regulations,
each individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall
be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under
division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the O.R.C. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to this municipality. No
remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of this Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of this Municipality's income tax return
shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023,
the extended due date of this Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time
to file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of this municipality's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's this Municipality income tax
return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date this Municipality income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall
grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the state tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of
the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
this Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of this
Municipality's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by this Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge
that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive
the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or failed to file for an
extension under division (G)(2)(B) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
         (Ord. 16-2023. Passed 12-28-23.)

taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with this
municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    The date or prescribed period or filed by which payments or other
documents shall be considered as having been made timely are as follows:
      (1)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
183.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
      (2)    If any payment required to be made, and/or any report, claim,
statement, or other document required to be filed, within a prescribed period
or on or before a prescribed date, is delivered after that period or that date
by United States mail to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official to
which the payment is required to be made, and/or to which the report, claim,
statement, or other document is required to be filed, the date of the postmark
stamped on the cover in which the payment, report, claim, statement, or other
document, is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of
payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date
on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for this Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
183.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by this Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to this Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)   (1)    Each return required by this Municipality to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
      (2)   The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate
that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to
contact the preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the
examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other
person only to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing
from the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the
examination or otherreview of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.
      (3)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents include the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by this Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by this Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer
or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of these rules and regs and of this Municipality's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated this municipality income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through

entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.

than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

taxable year, all of the following shall apply:

         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to this municipality

            (Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)
183.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   (1)    The credit, if any, provided to residents for municipal tax
paid elsewhere on the same income taxable under this Municipality's ordinance
is as stated in this Municipality's income tax ordinance.
      (2)    The credit allowed to resident individuals for the taxable net
profits (if any), on business income for taxable years 2016 and later shall be
calculated as follows:
         (a)    Annual profits and losses from business activities owned by the
taxpayer and earned in this Municipality and/or outside of this municipality
(collectively known as “jurisdictions") shall be netted (i.e. offset) in order
to calculate the resultant amount of current year taxable net profits to this
Municipality.
If this Municipality provides a residence tax credit and the results of (A)(2)
(a) produced a positive resultant amount of current year taxable net profits,
then proceed to section (A)(2)(b) to compute the allowable credit. If the
result is negative, no credit is allowed under this section.
         (b)   (i)    Add the current year business net profits from each
jurisdiction that had taxable current year net profits. Do not include in this
total a jurisdiction with current year business activities that resulted in a
net loss for that jurisdiction.
            (ii)    If the taxpayer has multiple business activities in the
current year within one jurisdiction, those business activity current year
profits and losses must be offset to determine that jurisdiction's resultant
current year taxable business net profits, if any. If the offsetting results in
positive taxable income, that jurisdiction is deemed to have "taxable current
year net profits". This offset calculation must be done for each jurisdiction
in which the taxpayer has multiple business activities.
            (iii)    Each jurisdiction which has taxable current year net
profits (either from a single business activity within the jurisdiction, or
after application of (A)(2)(b)(ii)) shall divide that jurisdiction's taxable
current year net profits by the sum of all jurisdictions' current year taxable
net profits determined in (A)(2)(b)(i) and (ii) to determine that
jurisdiction's percentage of the total.
         (c)    The resultant amount of current year taxable net profits
determined in (A)(2)(a) shall be multiplied by each jurisdiction's percentage
share calculated in (A)(2)(b)(ii), and that result shall be multiplied by the
respective jurisdiction's tax rate, if any, to determine the amount of tax paid
to that jurisdiction that may be eligible for credit from this Municipality.
         (d)    This Municipality shall then apply the credit rate (whether one
hundred percent (100%) or a reduced credit) and any credit limit, as stated in
this Municipality's ordinance, to the amount calculated in (A)(2)(c) for each
jurisdiction to determine the amount of credit this Municipality shall allow
for purposes of this section.
   (B)    This Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of this Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank. This indicates that this municipality does
not give credit for county income taxes.
(Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)

were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to this Municipality,
including the application of tax refunds applied as credits to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after

      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
183.05.
      
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
183.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
      
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
this Municipality under Section
183.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in this Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

183.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by this Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;

with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall

   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
 183.18 (A)(4).
   (F)    Refunds for days worked out of this Municipality are available only
to non-residents, and refunds shall be computed by dividing total wages by

      (2)   To his current estimated tax liability (and any excess refunded).

or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with

the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of the net profits, nor the method of filing, after the due date

      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax

return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return. Nothing in this division shall require the Tax Administrator to
accept such amended returns.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any additional tax due, together with any penalty and
interest thereon. If the tax, penalty and interest shown to be due is ten

reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,

that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00)
($10.00), no refund need be paid by this Municipality. A request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations
only to those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that'are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
183.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's this Municipality's tax
liability, that taxpayer shall make and file an amended this Municipality
return showing income subject to this Municipality income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain anew last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other this municipality official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within sixty (60) days
after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(l)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(l)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other this
Municipality official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
      
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
(Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)
183.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to this Municipality that arises pursuant to this Municipality's income tax
imposed in accordance with these rules and regs.
   (B)    Nothing in these rules and regs prohibits the Tax Administrator from
doing either of the following if such action is in the best interests of this
Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    The Tax Administrator may consider the following standards when
ascertaining with respect to a claim whether a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement is in the best interests of the municipal corporation:
      (1)    There exists a doubt as to whether the claim can be collected.
      (2)    There exists a substantial probability that, upon payment of the
claim and submission of a timely request for refund with respect to that
payment, the Tax Administrator would refund an amount that was illegally or
erroneously paid.
      (3)    There exists an economic hardship such that a compromise or
agreement would facilitate effective tax administration.
      (4)    There exists a joint liability among spouses, one of whom is an
innocent spouse, provided that any relief under this standard shall only affect
the claim as to the innocent spouse. A spouse granted relief under section 6015
of the Internal Revenue Code with regard to any income item is rebuttably
presumed to be an innocent spouse with regard to that income item to the extent
that income item is included in or otherwise affects the computation of a
municipal income tax or any penalty or interest on that tax.
      (5)    Any other reasonable standard that the Tax Administrator
establishes.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (F)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)
183.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by these rules and regs is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of this Municipality
as authorized by these rules and regs. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under these
rules and regs and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the state tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit this Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 1271-2019. Passed 11-18-19.)
183.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by this Municipality's ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud this Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

such identifying information, nothing in these rules and regs prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:

opinions of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
 
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.091 EXTENDED PARKING PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No vehicle shall be parked for longer than forty-eight hours in any
parking space or along any Village street or alley.
   (b)   Vehicles parked in violation of subsection (a) hereof may be
impounded, as provided in Section
303.08.
(Ord. 838-91. Passed 6-3-91.)
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSINO OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them or while the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in
subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
       (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in

         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in
Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

consecutively to the period of house arrest.
As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of sixty consecutive days required
by subsection (h)(1)C.2. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   “Parking meter” means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking
meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a balance of
legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   “Parking meter space” means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.
   No person shall park a vehicle in a parking meter space in such a way that

meter which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the
previous occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time. The parking meter space may be
lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time
shown on the meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established
maximum time limit.

   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF INCARCERATION.
   (a)   Any person who is convicted of an offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and who is sentenced to confinement in the Monroe County Jail shall
reimburse the Village of Woodsfield for its expenses incurred by reason of the
offender’s confinement, including, but not limited to, the expenses relating to
the provision of food, clothing and shelter. Such reimbursement shall include
expenses for pre-conviction confinement when credit for such confinement is
applied to the term of imprisonment.
 
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this ordinance shall be
determined by the Court after a hearing is held pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15,
or any subsequent amendment to that section. The amount of the reimbursement
ordered by the Court shall not exceed the actual costs of the confinement or
fifteen dollars ($15.00) for each day of confinement, whichever is less. The
Court shall consider all factors that affect the offender’s financial ability
to make reimbursement to the Village. When the Mayor’s Court makes a
reimbursement determination pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15, a judgment entry and
order of reimbursement shall be filed and entered that sets forth the total
amount of reimbursement due to the Village of Woodsfield, and the reimbursement
schedules and methods.
 
   (c)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the Court finds to be
indigent.
 
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the Village pursuant to this section
shall be paid into the general fund of the Village treasury.
 
   (e)   If an offender does not pay to the Village the reimbursement ordered
by the Court pursuant to this section, the Village Solicitor may collect that
claim or institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the Village in
the Monroe County Common Pleas Court to recover from the convict the
reimbursement for the expenses of confinement as determined by the Court. If an
action is filed it shall be brought not later than one year after the person is
released from incarceration. If it is deemed in the best interests of the
Village, the Village Solicitor is authorized to comprise and settle any such
claim in an amount less than the total reimbursement due to the City. If an
offender does not comply with the reimbursement determination for expenses of
confinement made by the Court, then the convict is deemed to be acting in bad
faith, vexatiously, wantedly, and obdurately and in any civil action on behalf
of the Village to recover from the convict the reimbursement for the expenses
of his confinement. The Village Solicitor or his representative shall request
an award of attorney fees as part of the costs of the collection proceedings.
The award of such attorney fees shall be paid into the General Fund of the
Village treasury.
(Ord. 929-97. Passed 1-3-97.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine  
First degree                                  $ 5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

name of the person, firm, copartnership or corporation for whose benefit the
work is to be done, and shall contain the number of square feet of the streets,
alleys or lawn plots intended to be removed. Before such permit is issued by
the Mayor, such person, firm, copartnership or corporation or the employees
thereof, as the case may be, shall pay to the Mayor one dollar ($1.00) for
every square foot of brick, concrete, Kentucky Rock asphalt sought to be
removed, and fifty cents ($.50) for every square foot of slag sought to be
removed or excavation made in unimproved streets or alleys or in lawn plots. In
calculating the square feet of any ditch to be made in a street that is paved
with brick or concrete, eight inches shall be added to the width thereof.
   (b)    If any such person, firm, copartnership or corporation desires to
make any excavations in the streets, alleys or lawn plots, and does not want to
comply with the above condition of making payment according to the square foot,
such person, firm, copartnership or corporation, at the time of obtaining the
permit from the Mayor, may deposit with the Clerk a cash bond in the sum of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) and a surety bond in the sum of one thousand dollars
($1,000) to be approved by the Mayor. Such bonds shall be conditioned that if
the person, firm, copartnership or corporation fails to replace the improved
streets or unimproved streets, alleys or lawn plots in as good condition as
before such excavation, then the Village may improve the same and charge such
expense to the entity who made such excavation. In the event the Village makes
such improvements, the cash bond shall first be used in paying for the
improvements. Then, if the cash bond is not sufficient, any additional cost
shall be charged to such person, firm, copartnership or corporation and the
Village may sue and recover on the surety bond.
(Unno. Ord. Passed 7-11-32.)
909.03 EXCAVATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)    The excavation shall be replaced in six-inch layers and heavily
rammed by a tamper not to exceed six inches square. If the dirt to be replaced
is dry it shall be made wet while being tamped. This process shall continue
until the ditch is full to the level of the bottom of the bricks, concrete,
slag or Kentucky Rock, as the case may be, the last six-inch layer being the
gravel, rock or other substance which was under the brick, concrete or Kentucky
Rock. The ditch shall then be filled to at least one-half inch above the
finished roadway with plank, which plank must be the full width and length of
the ditch. In case the ditch or opening that is to be made extends clear across
the street or so far as not to leave sufficient room for vehicles to pass on
the improved street, the excavation shall be made to the center of the street
only, leaving the remainder intact until the half is opened up and refilled as
herein provided, so that traffic may pass over the other half of the street,
after which the remaining ditch may be opened.
   (b)    After the ditch is filled up and planks placed as herein provided,
the Village shall then take care of the remaining fill and the laying of the
brick, concrete, slag or Kentucky Rock asphalt.
   (c)    If, however, the person, firm, copartnership or corporation puts up
the cash bond and the surety bond as hereinbefore provided, they may replace or
improve the street so that it will be in the same condition as it was prior to
the excavation, complying with the regulations hereinbefore mentioned, except
that they may replace the street surface instead of planking the same and
leaving the rest for the Village to complete.
(Unno. Ord. Passed 7-11-32.)
909.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor. Each day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed
a separate offense.

921.05 USE OF THE PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated
cooling water or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
   (b)    Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers,
or to a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling water
or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval of the
Superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer or natural outlet.
   (c)    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
      (1)    Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
      (2)    Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a
hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance or create any hazard in
the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant, including but not limited
to cyanides in excess of two mg/l as CN in the wastes as discharged to the
public sewer.
      (3)    Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5, or having any
other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment and personnel of the sewage works.
      (4)    Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable

by the Superintendent for such materials.
      (6)    Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the
composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the State, federal, or other
public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
      (7)    Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in
compliance with applicable State or federal regulations.
      (8)    Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
      (9)    Materials which exert or cause:
         A.    Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues or of dissolved
solids such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate.
         B.    Excessive discoloration such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions.
         C.    Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in

         D.    Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein.
      (10)    Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (e)    If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof, and which in the
judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
      (1)    Reject the wastes;
      (2)    Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)    Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions
of subsection (j) hereof.
   If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Superintendent, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)    Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand or other harmful ingredients. However, such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (g)    Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (h)    When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (i)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at such control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from
periodic grab samples.
   (j)    No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to payment therefor by
the industrial concern.

a new customer’s name.
(Ord. 749-87. Passed 5-18-87.)
   (f)   Necessity for Charges. It is hereby determined necessary for the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare and to conform with
Federal, State and local laws and regulations, that a system of charges for
sewerage service be established which allocates the cost of providing sewerage
service to each user in such a manner that the allocated costs are
proportionate to the cost of providing sewerage service to that user, insofar
as those costs can reasonably be determined.
   (g)   Sewer Charge System. The following sewer charge systems are hereby
established:
      (1)   User charge system. A system of user charges which requires all
users to pay their proportionate share of the operation and maintenance
(including replacement of equipment) of the sewerage system.
      (2)   Local capital cost recovery system. A system of charges designed to
recover from all users, their share of the cost of financing capital
improvements to the sewerage system.
   (h)   Rate Establishment Procedures.
      (1)   General. Rates shall be established by Council after a
recommendation from the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs, who shall review
the rates annually. Rates shall be designed to recover the cost of rendering
sewerage service for the year under consideration. Rates shall be established
so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonably expected
variations in the cost of providing, as well as variations in the demand for
services.
(Ord. 769-88. Passed 2-1-88.)
      (2)   Surplus. If there is a surplus in the user charge portion of the
income, then the subsequent years rates shall be adjusted to reflect a credit
of that surplus to each of the users by class. However, no balance in the
capital cost recovery fund alone shall be construed to trigger this provision
for subsequent rate reduction.
(Ord. 983-01. Passed 6-4-01.)
      (3)   Notification. At least annually in conjunction with a regular bill,
each user will be notified of the rate and the portion of the sewer service
charges which are attributable to the user charge.
   (i)   Method of Rate Determination.
      (1)    User charge system. The sewer rate structure shall include a
charge designed to recover from each user the cost of treating that user's
effluent and the cost of providing sewerage system related services to that
user. The user charge rate structure shall recover sufficient revenues to
adequately operate, maintain and replace sewerage system facilities and to
provide for an adequate level of sewerage system related services.
      (2)    Local capital cost recovery system. The sewer charge rate
structure shall include a unit cost designed to recover the local capital costs
associated with the financing of bonds to build and/or expand the sewerage
system.
   (j)    Sewer Service Charge. A sewer service charge will be rendered in
accordance with the applicable ordinance(s).
   (k)    Distribution of Sewerage System Revenues and Utilization of Funds.

      (2)    Utilization of funds.
         A.    Sewerage System Operating Fund shall be utilized for the
operation and maintenance costs.
         B.    Sewerage System Replacement Fund shall be utilized to provide
for the replacement of sewerage system equipment. The purpose of the
replacement fund is to insure the availability of financial resources for the
prompt and timely response to actual or incipient failure or loss of
effectiveness of sewerage system equipment through normal wear and tear,
thereby protecting the capital investment in these facilities.
         C.    Sewerage System Debt Retirement fund shall be utilized for the
redemption of sewer bonds and for interest thereon.
   (l)   Wastewater Volume Determination. The quantity subject to the charges
imposed by this chapter shall be the volume of wastes discharged to the
wastewater treatment works by the user. This volume shall be the same volume as
that recorded on the meter or meters used to measure water from the public
water system, unless the user is supplied with water from a source other than
the public water system and/or unless a substantial volume of water supplied to
the user is not discharged to the wastewater treatment works; in which cases,
the volume of water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be
determined by one or more meters installed to measure water flow and/or
wastewater discharged, or by other means approved by the Village. Meters
installed other than the meter or meters used to record consumption from the
public water system shall be approved by the Village and installed at the
expense of the user. Following approval, such meter(s) shall not be removed
without consent of the Village.
   (m)   Sewer Service Charge Outside Village.
      (1)    There is hereby levied and charged upon each lot or parcel of land
outside the corporation limits of the Village served by the sanitary sewage
system of the Village, a sewage service charge according to the rates as
provided for each lot or parcel of land within the Village. Council may
authorize and direct the Superintendent to enter into a written contract on
behalf of the Village with any person or firm, upon such terms as Council may
direct or furnish sewerage services outside the corporate limits. (Ord. 769-88.
Passed 2-1-88.)
      (2)    In addition to the charges stated in subsections (a) through (c),
nonresident customers shall be charged an additional ten percent (10%)
calculated on each portion of the sewer service charge, including Maintenance
and Operation, Replacement Fund, Capital Cost Recovery and the minimum charge.
(Ord.817-90. Passed 4-2-90.)
   (n)   Strength Classification. The following strength classifications are
hereby established:
      (1)    Standard strength. Standard strength shall include all wastewater
with load characteristics less than 360 mg/l of BOD and less than 340 mg/l of
suspended solids.
      (2)    Extra strength. Extra strength shall include all wastewater with
load characteristics equal to or greater than 360 milligrams per liter (mg/l)
BOD or 340 milligrams per liter of suspended solids.
   (o)    Strength Charge Factor. Extra strength users shall be charged a
surcharge on the O & M and report portions of the sewer service charge on the
basis of the following formula:
 
         [                ]
S.C.F. = 0.38   [0.5 (S.S. - 340) +0.5 (B.O.D. - 360) ]
         [ 340       360 ]
Where:
 
S.C.F. = Strength charge factor
S.S.   = Suspended solids value at point source
B.O.D.= 5 day 20° C. value at part source
0.49   = Ratio of strength annual cost to total annual cost of O & M.
   Assumes 50-50 split of strength cost between suspended solids and B.O.D.
(Ord.769-88. Passed 2-1-88.)
921.10 BILLING; PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT.

specifications of appropriate pipe, coupling(s), saddle(s), valve(s), hydrant
(s), and any other required hardware or fixtures shall be defined in the
exclusive, reasonable discretion of the Superintendent.
(Ord. 01-2024. Passed 2-8-24.)
921.12  CONNECTIONS TO STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   No house sewer or drain shall be constructed to connect with a public
storm sewer nor shall any connection be made to a public storm sewer within the
corporation limits of the Village until the written permission of the Mayor has
been obtained by the person, firm or corporation proposing or employed to do
the work. An application for a permit shall be signed by the owner, lessee or
agent of the property for which the connection is desired and shall be
accompanied by a fee of one dollar ($1.00).
   (b)   The written permission to construct a house sewer or drain connection
with a public storm sewer shall specify the permissible use of such house sewer
or drain and such specifications shall be governed by the following
requirements. Such house sewer or drain may be used for the removal of surface
water, rain water from roofs, subsoil drainage, building foundation drainage,
cistern overflow, clear water from condensers, waste water from water motors
and elevators and any other clean and unobjectionable waste water. Such house
sewer or drain shall not receive sewerage, floor drainage, industrial waste,
septic tank overflow, cesspool overflow, privy vault drainage, kitchen waste or

1109.02   Designation as a conditional use.
1109.03   Conditional use review application.
1109.04   Review of conditional use.
1109.05   Public hearing and notice by Village Council.

1109.08   General criteria for all conditional uses.
1109.09   Similar uses.
1109.01 CONDITIONAL USE ZONING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations, a conditional use zoning permit is
required and the application for such conditional use zoning permit shall be
submitted and reviewed according to the following review procedures. (Ord.
1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.02 DESIGNATION AS A CONDITIONAL USE.
   (a)    Certain types of uses are classified as conditional uses because of
their uncommon or unique characteristics, infrequency of occurrence, large area
requirements, or potential for significant impact on a particular district.
Consequently, the conditional use procedures call for a more flexible and
equitable procedure for properly accommodating such activities in the
community. The forces that influence decisions regarding the nature, magnitude
and location of such types of land use activities are many and varied,
depending upon functional characteristics, competitive situations, and the
availability of land. The purpose of this section is to provide controllable
and reasonably flexible requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow
practicable latitude for the investor, but that will, at the same time,
maintain adequate provisions for the health, safety, convenience and general
welfare of the Village's inhabitants.
   (b)    In order to accomplish such a dual objective, this chapter sets forth
a review procedure that enables a more detailed consideration of each
conditional use in regards to the proposed conditions of location, design,
size, operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic and traffic movement,
concentration of population, processes and equipment employed, and amount and
kinds of public facilities and services required, together with many other
factors. Review of this information by the Village Council is required to
ensure that each proposed conditional use is consistent with the intent and
objectives of the particular district in which it is to be located.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.03 CONDITIONAL USE REVIEW APPLICATION.
   (a)    Application Submitted. The owner, or agent thereof, of property for
which such conditional use is proposed shall file with the Village
Administrator an application for conditional use approval. The application for
a conditional use shall disclose all uses proposed for the development, their
location, extent and characteristics and shall include the items set forth
below.
      (1)    Completed application form along with the application fee.
      (2)    A list of all property owners adjoining any part of the property
on which the conditional use is proposed, including their addresses and
permanent parcel number and lot numbers, as shown on the current tax duplicate
in the Monroe County Auditor’s Office.
      (3)    A site plan indicating the proposed development, minimum setbacks
and any other relevant information.
   (b)    Distribution of the Application. The Village Administrator shall
forward the application to the appropriate Village departments and professional
consultants for review and comment. Any reports, comments, or expert opinions
shall be returned to the Village Administrator within ten (10) days from the
date the application is deemed complete.
   (c)    Transmission to the Village Council. The Village Administrator shall
distribute the application and any reports prepared by the individuals in
subsection (b) above to the Village Council. (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.04 REVIEW OF CONDITIONAL USE.
   The Village Council shall review the proposed conditional use, as presented
on the submitted plans and specifications, to determine whether or not the
proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with the purpose and intent of this
Planning and Zoning Code.
   (a)    The Village Council shall review the application to determine if the
establishment and operation of the proposed use complies with any specific
requirements established for that particular use, as set forth in Chapter
1131, Use-Specific Standards in this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (b)    The Village Council may require additional plans and documents
further clarifying the nature and extent of the use or any aspect of the
application.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.05 PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE BY VILLAGE COUNCIL.
   The Village Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed conditional
use. Notice of such public hearing shall be given by first class mail or hand
delivered to the applicant and to the owners of property owners adjoining the
property on which the use is proposed. Failure of delivery of such notice shall
not invalidate action taken on such application. Further notice shall be
provided on the Village’s website. All notices shall be made at least ten (10)
days before the date of said public hearing. All notices shall set forth the
time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed conditional
use. The Village Council may recess such hearings from time to time, and, if
the time and place of the continued hearing is publicly announced at the time
of the adjournment, no further notice shall be required.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.06 ACTION BY VILLAGE COUNCIL.
   The Village Council shall take one of the following actions:
   (a)    If the proposed conditional use is determined by the Village Council
to be appropriate and in conformance with the requirements of this Planning and
Zoning Code, the Village Council shall approve the conditional use. In
approving any such use or structure the Village Council may attach additional
conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this Code, as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or
minimize adverse effects upon adjacent property.
   (b)    The Village Council shall deny the application if the Village Council
concludes that, if completed as proposed, the development will not be in
compliance with the requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code. Such action
shall be stated in writing and include specific findings, based upon the
evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-
21.)
1109.07 REVOCATION OF CONDITIONAL USE APPROVAL.
   A conditional use zoning permit may be revoked if the established conditions
for approval are violated. The Village Administrator is responsible for
advising the Village Council of any violations, and the Village Council may
revoke the conditional use zoning permit.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.08 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following criteria. Furthermore,
the Village Council shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate
evidence that:
   (a)    The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;
   (b)    The proposed building or use will not result in the destruction,
loss, or damage of any feature determined by the Village Council to be of
significant natural, scenic, or historic importance;
   (c)    The hours of operation of the proposed use are similar to a use
permitted in the district;
   (d)    The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
   (e)    Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
   (f)    Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1109.09 SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Planning and Zoning Code and
amendments thereto, uses of land or structures, which are compatible with each
other, are permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses are
created and are not addressed by this Planning and Zoning Code, this section
provides the procedure by which the Village Council may make a determination
that a new use is similar to a use permitted in a district.
   (a)    Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Village Council determines that such proposed use is in compliance with the
following provisions:
      (1)    The proposed use is not prohibited in any other district;
      (2)    The proposed use is not listed as a permitted building or use in
any other district;
      (3)    The proposed use conforms to and is consistent with the purpose
statement of the proposed district more appropriately than in any other
district;
      (4)    The proposed use is of the same general character as the permitted
uses in the district to which it is proposed or is similar to a specific use
permitted in that district.
   (b)    Assignment to Districts. If the Village Council approves the proposed
similar use, then the similar use shall be added to those districts that allow
the principal or conditional use that is most similar, as determined by the
Village Council.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)

1121.04   Zoning of annexed land.
1121.01 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Planning and Zoning
Code, the Village of Woodsfield is divided into the following zoning districts:
   Residential Districts 
      R-1 Residential One-Family District
      R-2 Residential One & Two-Family District

   Nonresidential Districts
      DB Downtown Business District
      GB General Business District
      LI Light Industrial District
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1121.02 ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   (a)    The boundaries of the districts are shown on the map entitled
"Official Zoning Map of the Village of Woodsfield, Ohio”, or “Zoning Map”,
which is made a part of this Planning and Zoning Code. The map and all the
notations, references, and other information shown thereon are a part of this
Planning and Zoning Code and have the same force and effect as if the district
map and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon were
all fully set forth or described therein.
   (b)    No changes of any nature shall be made to the official Zoning Map or
matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)    Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official
Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or published, the official
Zoning Map, shall be the final authority as the current zoning status of land
and water areas, buildings and other structures.
   (d)    In the event that the official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed
or lost, Village Council may, by Code, adopt a new District Map which shall
supersede the prior official Map. The new official Zoning Map may correct
drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official District Map but no
such corrections shall have the effect of amending the original Planning and
Zoning Code or subsequent amendments thereof.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1121.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   (a)    The Zoning District Map is not an exact or precise engineer's
rendering but shall be considered a detailed approximation intended to
accurately illustrate the zoning districts of the Village, however, the
language printed on the Map is certain, accurate, and controlling. The District
Map, including the language thereon, shall take precedence of a conflict
between the Map and language in the Zoning Code.
   (b)    Boundary Interpretation. All zoning district boundary lines shown on
the Zoning Map shall be interpreted and determined as follows:
      (1)    Where boundaries apparently follow lot lines and are not more than
ten feet therefrom, the lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;
      (2)    Where boundaries apparently follow streets, alleys or railroad
lines, the center lines of such streets, alleys or railroad lines shall be
construed to be such boundaries;
      (3)    Where boundaries apparently follow shore lines, the shore lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries and, in the event of change in the
shore lines, shall be construed as moving with the actual shore lines.
      (4)    Where boundaries approximately follow municipal corporation
limits, such boundaries shall be construed as following such limits.
      (5)    In all other cases, the location of any boundary line, unless
indicated by dimensions of the Zoning Map, shall be determined by the use of
the scale appearing thereon.
   (c)    Vacation of Public Ways. Whenever any street or public way is vacated
by official action of Village Council, the zoning district adjoining each side
of the street or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of
such vacation and all area included in the vacation shall thereafter be subject
to all regulations of the extended districts.
   (d)    Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the official District Map, or in other circumstances not covered
by any of the above statements on District Boundaries, or if there is a dispute
concerning the exact location of zoning district boundaries, the Village
Council shall interpret the district boundaries.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1121.04 ZONING OF ANNEXED LAND.
   In the event any territory is hereafter annexed to Woodsfield Village, the
Village Council shall subsequently officially zone the property and amend the
Zoning Map in conformance with the Amendment Procedures in Chapter
1117.

   Residential Districts (“R-1" Residential One-Family, “R-2" Residential One &
Two-Family, and ”R-MF” Residential Multi-Family) and their regulations are
established in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To regulate the bulk and location of dwellings, accessory buildings,
and other structures on each lot in order to maintain a housing unit density
consistent with existing Village development patterns and to protect and
promote the stability of existing residential development;
   (b)    The “R-1" Residential One-Family District provides for residential
development in areas where this pattern of development already exists. This
district also provides for agricultural uses at the edges of the Village.
   (c)    The “R-2" Residential One and Two-Family District provides for
residential development of one-family and two-family units in areas of the
Village where this pattern of development already exists. This district is also
applied at the edges of existing development where the extension of the current
pattern of lot size is appropriate. This district may serve as a transition
zoning between one-family and multi-family or between one-family and commercial
uses.
   (d)   The “R-MF” Residential Multi-family District provides for residential
development, including multi-family development, on lots located in proximity
to Downtown Woodsfield where community services, shopping and related personal
services are within walking distance.

Business and Industrial District Regulations
1127.01   Intent.
1127.02   Permitted uses.

1127.05   Business and industrial performance standards.
1127.01 INTENT.
   Business and Industrial Districts (“DB” Downtown Business, “GB” General
Business, and “LI” Light Industrial) and their regulations are established in
order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To provide appropriate and convenient districts of sufficient size to
carry on the exchange of goods and services, processing, and distribution
activities to serve the community, and thereby promote employment and
strengthen the economy of the community;
   (b)    To protect and stabilize both residential and nonresidential
development from congestion by requiring setbacks and limiting the bulk and
density of development in relation to adjacent buildings and available land and
by requiring sufficient off-street parking and loading facilities;
   (c)    The “DDB” Downtown Business District is established to preserve the
downtown as a core for retail sales and services in the Village’s traditional
Main Street district. It is further the purpose of this district to promote and
enhance the existing compact pedestrian orientation of the Downtown by
permitting buildings close to the street and to one another and modifying the
parking regulations.
   (d)    The “GB” General Business District is established to accommodate the
continuation and reasonable expansion of existing commercial businesses located
along the Village’s primary commercial corridors, and to enable the
establishment of new businesses that can locate in ways that minimize impacts
on nearby residential districts.
   (e)    The “LI” Light Industrial District is established to accommodate
industrial activities in areas suitable for such development, that are
adequately served by major streets and utilities, free from encroachment of
residential and institutional uses. The uses allowed are those that because of
their normally unobjectionable characteristics can be in relatively close
proximity to residential districts.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1127.02 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)    Permitted Use Table Summary. Table
1127.02 sets forth the uses allowed in nonresidential districts. The
abbreviations used in the table are described as follows:
      (1)    Uses Permitted By Right. A "P" in a cell indicates that the use is
allowed by-right as a principal use in the respective district provided that
all requirements of other Village ordinances and this Planning and Zoning Code
have been met;
      (2)    Conditional Uses. A "C" in a cell indicates that the use is
regulated as a conditional use. The use may be permitted in the respective
district if approved through the conditional use review process in compliance
with Chapter
1109, provided that all requirements of other Village ordinances and this
Planning and Zoning Code have been met.
      (3)    Accessory Uses. An "A" in a cell indicates that the use is a
permitted accessory use, provided it is clearly incidental and subordinate to a
permitted principal or conditional use listed in Table
1127.02 and that the requirements of all other Village ordinances and this
Planning and Zoning Code have been met.
      (4)    Permitted Principal Uses with Supplemental Standards. A “PS” in a
cell indicates that a use category is allowed by-right in the respective zoning
district if it meets the additional standards set forth in the numerically
referenced sections.
         A.    Permitted uses with standards are subject to all other
applicable regulations of this Code.
         B.    Permitted uses with standards under this category are approved
administratively through the zoning permit procedure (See Chapter
1107 Zoning Permits).
      (5)    Prohibited Use.
         A.    A “NP” in a cell indicates that a use is not permitted in the
respective district.
         B.    Any use not specifically listed in Table
1127.02 shall be a prohibited use in these zoning districts and shall only be
permitted upon amendment of this Code and/or the Zoning Map as provided in
Chapter
1117 or approval as a similar use as provided in Section
1109.09.
   (b)    Compliance with Standards. Although a use may be indicated as a
permitted use in a particular district, it shall not be approved on a lot
unless it can be located thereon in full compliance with all of the standards
and other regulations of this Code applicable to the specific use and lot in
question, including but not limited to any supplemental use-specific standards
referenced in Table
1127.02.

   (g)    To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1139.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)    The regulations contained in this Chapter shall apply to all signs,

(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1139.03 COMPUTATIONS AND RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   The following regulations shall control the computation and measurement of
sign area, sign
height, window area, and building frontage:
   (a)    Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)    Sign area shall include the face of the entire display area of the
sign. Sign area shall not include the structural support unless such structural
support is an integral part of the sign design.
      (2)    The surface area of a sign shall be computed by calculating the
area of the sign face. For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or
otherwise prepared and intended to include a background for the sign display,
the area or dimensions shall include the entire portion within such frame or
background.
      (3)    For a sign comprised of individual elements such as letters,
symbols, or other graphic objects or representations that are painted, attached
to, or otherwise affixed to a surface such as a wall, window, canopy, or
awning, the sign area shall be based on the sum of the individual areas of the
smallest geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes capable of
encompassing the perimeters of the individual elements comprising the sign.
When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated
by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining
the geometric shape, or combination of shapes, that comprises all of the
display areas, including the space between different elements. Minor appendages
to a particular regular shape, as determined by the Village Administrator,
shall not be included in the total area of a sign.
      (4)    For freestanding signs:
         A.    The sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the
faces as prescribed above when two (2) identical display faces are joined
parallel to each other and are within two (2) feet of each other.
         B.    No more than two (2) display faces shall be permitted for one
sign.
   (b)    Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. The length of the
building that faces the street or the length of the wall of the building that
contains the main entrance to the uses therein shall be considered the building
frontage.
      (1)    The building frontage shall be measured along the front wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls. In the case of an
irregular wall surface, a straight line extended along such wall surface shall
be used to measure the length.
      (2)    For lots fronting on two (2) or more streets, or where the
building has its main entrance on a wall other than the wall that faces the
street, the building frontage shall be calculated separately for each building
wall facing a street or having a main entrance. The sign area that is located
on a particular building wall shall not exceed the area permitted for such
building wall.
      (3)    For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.
   (c)    Determining Sign Height.
      (1)    The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from average
finished grade level adjacent to the base of the sign at its point of
attachment to the ground to the highest point of the sign including frame and
structural members. A freestanding sign on a manmade base, including a graded
earth mound, shall be measured from the top of the nearest street curb.
      (2)    Clearance for freestanding and projecting signs shall be measured
as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point
of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments.
   (d)    Determining Window Area. The window area of a building shall be the
total glass area of windows on the building frontage. For the purposes of these
regulations, a single glass window shall be the area of all the glass and
mullions that has less than four (4) inches of separation from other glass
areas. For the purposes of determining window area for ground floor occupants,
the ground floor shall only include the glass area to a height of fifteen (15)
feet above the elevation of the first floor of the building.
   (e)    Sign Setbacks. The required setbacks for freestanding signs are set
forth in Section
1139.04 for lots in Residential Districts and in Section
1139.05 for lots in Business and Industrial Districts. The required setbacks
for a sign shall apply to all elements of the sign, including its frame and
base.

grading/drainage patterns and other site structures for reference.
   (b)    Approval of a Landscaping and Buffer Plan.
      (1)    No zoning permit shall be issued without approval of a landscaping
and buffer plan by the Village Administrator or by Village Council for
conditional uses.
      (2)    Failure to implement the landscaping and buffer plan within twelve
(12) months of the issuance of a zoning permit shall be deemed a violation of
this resolution. (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1141.04 BUFFERING WHEN LOT ABUTS A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.
   When a lot in any Business or Industrial District abuts a Residential
District or when a nonresidential use is approved in a Residential District,
buffering along the entire length of the common boundary shall be provided in
accordance with the following regulations.
   (a)    Buffer Areas. Buffer areas shall be provided as set forth below:
      (1)    When a development in a “GB” General Business District or “LI”
Light Industrial District abuts a residential district, a buffer area with a
minimum width of twenty (20) feet shall be provided unless a greater setback is
required as part of a conditional use.
      (2)    When a use other than one-family or two-family dwelling is
approved in any residential district, a buffer area with a minimum width of ten
(10) feet shall be provided unless a greater setback is required as part of a
conditional use.
      (3)    No structure shall be permitted within a required buffer area
other than a wall, fence, mound, or earth berm. Driveways may cross
perpendicularly across a buffer area, disturbing the least amount of buffer.
   (b)    Screening Materials.
      (1)    Screening within the buffer yard shall consist of one or a
combination of the following:
         A.    A dense vegetative planting incorporating trees and/or shrubs of
a variety which shall be equally effective in winter and summer.
         B.    A non-living opaque structure such as a brick, slump block,
stucco masonry wall, or a solid fence that is compatible with the principal
structure.
         C.    A fence having openings through which light and air may pass
together with a landscaped area.
         D.    A landscaped mound or berm at least ten (10) feet wide. Earth
berming, if utilized, shall be at a maximum slope of 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical) unless appropriate engineering measures are taken. Provisions must
also be taken to control surface water runoff so the rate of flow of surface
water leaving the site would not be greater than if the site had remained
undeveloped.
      (2)    The location of the wall, fence, or vegetation shall be placed
within the buffer yard to maximize the screening effect as determined by the
Village Council.
      (3)    Existing landscape material shall be shown on the required plan,
and any material in satisfactory condition may be used to satisfy these
requirements in whole or in part when, in the opinion of the Village Council,
such material meets the requirements and achieves the objectives of this
chapter.
   (c)    Height of Screening. The height of screening shall be in accordance
with the following:
      (1)    Visual screening walls, fences, or mounds and fences in
combination shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high measured from the natural
grade, in order to accomplish the desired screening effect.
      (2)    Vegetation shall be a minimum of six (6) feet high measured from
the natural grade, in order to accomplish the desired screening effect. The
required height shall be achieved no later than twelve (12) months after the
initial installation.
   (d)    Placement of Screening. The location of the wall, fence, or
vegetation shall be placed within the buffer area to maximize the screening
effect. Trees, evergreens, and/or hedges shall be adequately spaced and
appropriately staggered to meet the screening objectives within two (2) years
after the initial installation. The landscaping and buffer plan shall indicate
the specific type of option(s) to be used.
   (e)    Additional Screening Required. Whenever a lot with a lower elevation
than the abutting residential parcel requires screening and buffering, the
height of the required screening shall be sufficient to adequately screen the
site from the adjacent residential lot. The Village Council may, in its review
of the landscaping plan, require more than the minimum requirements specified
in this section in order to accomplish the desired screening effect.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1141.05 SCREENING OF PARKING LOTS ALONG STREET.
   Whenever parking areas consisting of ten (10) spaces or more are located
such that the parked cars will be visible from a public street, landscaping
shall be planted and maintained between the street and the parking lot. Such
landscaping shall be a minimum height of two and one-half feet, located
adjacent to the parking lot and shall be placed to effectively obscure a
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the parking area within two years after the
initial installation.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1141.06 INTERIOR LANDSCAPING OF PARKING LOTS.
   Landscaping in the interior of parking lots shall be provided in accordance
with the following requirements.
   (a)    For any parking area designed to accommodate thirty (30) or more
vehicles, a minimum of five percent (5%) of the parking lot shall be planted as
landscaped island areas. For the purpose of this Section, the area of a parking
lot shall be the total vehicular surface area including circulation aisles.
   (b)    Such islands shall be developed and distributed throughout the
parking lot so as to provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of
pavement.
   (c)    Each island shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in any horizontal
dimension
   (d)    Each island shall provide at least one major shade tree having a
clear trunk height of at least six (6) feet and a minimum caliper of two (2)
inches. Shrub plantings adjacent to a building along the perimeter of the
parking lot, or in any part of a yard, shall not be counted as interior
landscaping.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1141.07 SCREENING OF OUTSIDE STORAGE AREAS OR OTHER SERVICE AREAS.
   In addition to all other landscaping standards in this section, screening
shall be required to conceal specific nonresidential areas of high visual or
auditory impact. Such areas shall be screened at all times, unless otherwise
specified, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or other landscaping
material.
   (a)    Items to Be Screened. The following areas shall be screened in
accordance with this section:
      (1)    Large waste receptacles (dumpsters) and refuse collection points
(including large recycling containers);
      (2)    Loading and service areas;
      (3)    All outdoor storage areas;
      (4)    Mechanical equipment and utility meters not located on, and
screened by, the building or structure.
   (b)    Screening Requirements.
      (1)    All screening shall be approved during zoning permit review.
      (2)    All items to be screened shall be shielded from view from public
roads and adjoining residential zoned property.
      (3)    All items to be screened shall be located in the side or rear
yards.
      (4)    All items to be screened shall be provided with a visual screen
consisting of fences, walls, berms or approved plant materials or a combination
thereof. The screening shall be at least one foot higher than the item to be
screened but not less than six (6) feet in height and shall extend along three
sides of the items to be screened. For dumpsters, a gate shall be required on
the fourth side where access is provided to the dumpster. The gate shall be
opaque enough to shield from view the interior of the service area.
      (5)    If an adjacent building provides screening on one side of the
service area, only two sides need to be screened, bermed, or walled, with a
gate required in front of the service area. The gate shall be opaque enough to
shield from view the interior of the service area.
      (6)    All plant materials used for required screens around service areas
shall be of an evergreen variety.
      (7)    Roof mounted mechanical equipment shall be screened by parapet
walls or other screening device with height not lower than six inches below the
height of mechanical equipment
      (8)    Fences or walls shall be compatible with the architectural
materials and patterns of the principal structure.
         (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1141.08 LANDSCAPE MATERIALS.
   The proposed landscape materials should complement the form of the existing
trees and plantings, as well as the development's general design and
architecture. The amount and type of shade or sun should be considered in
selecting plant materials.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1141.09 MAINTENANCE.
   (a)    Required yards and all other portions of the lot not covered by
permitted structures shall be landscaped with grass, trees, shrubbery and/or
other appropriate ground cover or landscaping material, which at all times
shall be pruned, trimmed, and maintained in good and healthy condition.
   (b)    All landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained according
to accepted nursery industry procedures. The property owner shall be
responsible for continued, perpetual maintenance of all landscaping materials,
and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse,
debris, and noxious and unsightly weeds at all times.
   (c)    All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one
year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first; while other
defective landscape material shall be replaced or repaired within three months.
Replacement material shall conform to the original intent of the landscaping
and buffer plan.
   (d)    Violation of installation provisions or failure to maintain the
landscaping shall constitute a violation of this Code. Such violation shall be
grounds for the Village Administrator to require replacement of the landscape
material or initiate legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this
resolution.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
CHAPTER 1145
Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Lots
1145.01   Intent.
1145.02   Lawful nonconformance.
1145.03   Completion of construction with zoning permit.
1145.04   Nonconforming use of buildings and land.
1145.05   Nonconforming buildings and structures.
1145.06   Nonconforming sign.
1145.07   Existing use deemed conditional use; permit required for change.
1145.08   Nonconforming status.
1145.01 INTENT.
   The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any lot, use, building, or
structure that was lawful at the time it was established but which has become
nonconforming as a result of the adoption of this Planning and Zoning Code as
well as amendments made to this Planning and Zoning Code or the Official Zoning
Map.
   In accordance with the ORC 713.15, the lawful establishment of nonconforming
uses, buildings, lots, structures, signs, and other facilities is herein
recognized by providing for the continuance of nonconforming status subject to
regulations which limit their completion, restoration, reconstruction,
extension and substitution. While it is the intent of this Planning and Zoning
Code to permit such nonconforming status to continue until abandoned, removed
or abated, the continued existence of a nonconforming status is considered to
be generally inconsistent with the land use plan of the Village and should be
discouraged. It is further the intent of these regulations that any
nonconforming use, building, structure, sign or other facility shall not be
reconstructed, enlarged, restored, expanded or extended, except in accordance
with the regulations contained in this chapter. Further, the continuation of a
lawful nonconforming status shall not be construed as a reason to permit
additions to such nonconforming status not specifically permitted by this
chapter.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.02 LAWFUL NONCONFORMANCE.
   (a)    Applicability. This Chapter addresses three categories of
nonconformities, regulated as:
      (1)    Nonconforming Uses (Section
1145.04) - addresses the use of the property.
      (2)    Nonconforming Buildings and Structures (Section
1145.05) . addresses buildings and structures that no longer comply with
building setbacks, or size limitations, height, etc.
      (3)    Nonconforming Site Conditions (Section
1145.06) . addresses developments that do not meet current requirements for
such items as parking lot standards, landscaping, and signs.
   (b)    A nonconforming use, building or structure, site conditions or lot
does not include nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted
variance from a zoning regulation.
   (c)    Ordinary repairs, repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be performed on a nonconforming structure or
on any portion of a structure that contains a nonconforming use provided that
the cubic content shall not be increased and no structural parts shall be
replaced except when required by law to restore such building or structure to a
safe condition or to make the building or structure conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
   (d)    A zoning permit shall be required for any change to a nonconforming
use, building, structure or lot beyond ordinary repairs noted in subsection
1145.02(b).
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.03 COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH ZONING PERMIT.
   Nothing in this Planning and Zoning Code shall prohibit the completion of
the construction and the use of nonconforming buildings for which a zoning
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Planning and Zoning
Code, or amendments thereto, provided that construction is commenced within
ninety (90) days after such effective date and if completed within one (1) year
after the issuance of the zoning permit.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.04 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS AND LAND.
   Where, at the time of passage of any provision of the Planning and Zoning
Code, a lawful use of a building or land, or building and land in combination,
existed which would not be permitted by said provision, the use of such land or
building may be continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful, and in
compliance with the following:
   (a)    Nonconforming Use Distinguished from Nonconforming Building. A
nonconforming use may be located within a conforming or nonconforming building.
This section addresses only the use.
   (b)    Expansion of Use Prohibited. No use shall be expanded, enlarged or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, but shall not
be limited to:
      (1)    Expansion of such use to any structure or land area other than
that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code, or
any amendment hereto which causes such use to become nonconforming.
      (2)    Expansion of such use within a building or other structure to any
portion of the floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on
the effective date of this Code, or any amendment thereto which causes such use
to become nonconforming.
      (3)    An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the
normal or previously approved or permitted hours of operation.
   (c)    Change in use.
      (1)    A nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in
the district in which it is located shall not be changed to any use other than
a use permitted in the zoning district in which the property is located.
      (2)    A nonconforming use in a structure not designed for a use
permitted in the district in which it is located shall not be changed to any
use other than a nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted
classification and of the same or lesser level of intensity and impact as
determined by the Village Council or to a use permitted in the zoning district
in which the structure is located.
      (3)    Once changed to a permitted use or to a more restrictive and less
intensive use in accordance with Subsection (c)(1) and (c)(2) above, the use
shall not be changed back to the prior nonconforming use. The use is deemed
changed when an existing nonconforming use is terminated and a new use
commences and continues for a period of seven consecutive days, including any
change of use in violation of this subsection.
   (d)   Structural Alteration or Enlargement. No building or structure
containing a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or enlarged.
   (e)    Moving. No nonconforming use (and associated building or structure)
may be moved to any other part or parcel of land upon which the same condition
existed at the time the use became nonconforming, except to make it a
conforming use.
   (f)    Damage or Destruction. When a structure occupied by a nonconforming
use is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than sixty-six
percent (66%) of the area of the structure, as calculated by the Village
Administrator utilizing the footprint of the building measured around its
perimeter and including all levels of the structure, the structure shall not be
restored unless its use thereafter conforms to the use regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located. Reconstruction shall require a zoning
permit, be constructed and restored as previously existing providing the
construction and restoration is done within one (1) year from the date of said
destruction and such nonconforming use is recommenced within ninety (90) days
of completion of construction or restoration.
   (g)    Abandonment or Discontinuance. In accordance with ORC 713.15, if any
such nonconforming use is voluntarily discontinued for a period of one year or
more, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this Planning and Zoning Code. (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.05 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   A building or other structure existing lawfully at the time this Planning
and Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but
which does not conform to yard dimensions, lot coverage, or other regulations
of the district in which it is located, is a lawful, nonconforming building or
structure. Such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, provided:
   (a)    In the event such nonconforming building or structure is occupied by
a nonconforming use, the restrictions for nonconforming uses in Section
1145.04 shall prevail.
   (b)    Such nonconforming structure may be expanded, remodeled, or enlarged
on the same lot, provided such expansion, remodeling or enlargement is in
conformance with current provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (c)    Should such nonconforming structure be destroyed by fire or other
casualty to an extent of more than sixty-six percent (66%) of the structure, as
calculated by the Village Administrator utilizing the footprint of the building
measured around its perimeter and including all levels of the structure, the
remainder of the building shall be demolished and shall not be reconstructed
except in conformity with the provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)    Should the owner of the property intentionally demolish more than
fifty percent (50%) of the area of the structure, as calculated by the Village
Administrator utilizing the footprint of the building measured around its
perimeter and including all levels of the structure, the remainder of the
building shall be demolished and shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (e)    If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful
due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not
thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.06 NONCONFORMING SIGN.
   A sign, lawfully existing at the time this Planning and Zoning Code, or any
amendment thereto, became or becomes effective, but which fails to conform to
the sign regulations of the district in which it is located is a nonconforming
sign. Nonconforming signs shall comply with the regulations set forth in
Section
1139.11, Nonconforming Signs.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.07 EXISTING USE DEEMED CONDITIONAL USE; PERMIT REQUIRED FOR CHANGE.
   Any lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of a
zoning amendment, is listed as a conditional use in the district in which it is
located, shall be deemed without further action to be a conforming conditional
use. Any change, modification, enlargement or alteration of such use, site
development conditions or signs, or change in ownership shall only be permitted
upon review and approval by the Village Council according to the procedures for
conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1109.
(Ord. 1291-2021. Passed 4-5-21.)
1145.08 NONCONFORMING STATUS.
   Any person or corporation claiming right of operation or use as a lawful
nonconforming use as described in this section shall make and preserve
reasonable records and other proofs of existence and extent of such use at the
time it becomes nonconforming due to this Planning and Zoning Code or
amendments hereto.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)

to stop work is hereby declared a public nuisance. (OBC 109)
1301.07 UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Unsafe Buildings Defined.  Structures or existing equipment that are
unsafe or unsanitary due to inadequate means of egress facilities, inadequate
light and ventilation, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life, shall be deemed a serious hazard. Where a building is
found to be a serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building
shall be vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious
hazard, it shall be razed.
   (b)   Orders, Injunction Proceedings. Where the Building Official finds that
a building is a serious hazard and the owner of such building fails, in the
time specified in an order from the Building Official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration. Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition. To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended to
be made or a change of occupancy occurs during the restoration of the

However approval by the Board of Building Standards of any fixture, device,
material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules. As provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions.
Such interpretations, policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the
intent and purpose of this Code. Building Officials shall be responsible to
assure that a system is in place to track and audit all projects, to assure
that all Building Department personnel perform their duties in accordance with
this section, and for the overall administration of a Building Department as
follows:
   (b)   Applications and Plan Approvals. The Building Official shall receive
applications, require or cause the submitted construction documents to be
examined, ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and
described is in accordance with the requirements of this Ohio Building Code,
and shall issue plan approvals for the construction, erection, alteration,
demolition and moving of buildings and structures. The Building Official shall
require a master plans examiner or elective plans examiners to examine the
construction documents to verify the construction indicated is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and shall assure coordination of plan
review.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders. The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance
with Section
1301.06 to ensure compliance with the Ohio Building Code.

1305.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Woodsfield as identified in subsection (b) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Woodsfield.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   “Flood Insurance Study Monroe County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas”
and “Flood Insurance Rate Map Monroe County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas” both
effective August 19, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Woodsfield as required by Section
1305.04(c).
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file in the Office of the Clerk, Woodsfield Municipal
Building, 221 South Main Street, Woodsfield, Ohio 43793.
   (c)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing legislative enactments including Subdivision
Regulations, Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other legislative enactments, the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (d)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (e)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Woodsfield, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(Ord. 1121-2010. Passed 8-2-10.)
1305.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: (See “Lowest Floor.”)
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Jimmy Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities
be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus sufficient freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Woodsfield’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revisions (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minium
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed areas (including
basement) of a structure. This definitions excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
“manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3733.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Woodsfield
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 19, 2010, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institutions, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio Revised Code sections
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated

   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvements, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be

         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Woodsfield, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Woodsfield have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Woodsfield Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
of Woodsfield boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the Village of Woodsfield suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Woodsfield has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1305.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures including issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation
whey these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B, items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Woodsfield specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1305.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Office of the Clerk of the Village of Woodsfield, 221 South Main Street,
Woodsfield, Ohio 43793.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of such notice and order,
or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or
for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.  
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in a schedule of fees duly adopted by the Village
of Woodsfield.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in at least one (1) newspaper
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances. 
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. 1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Monroe County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 1121-2010. Passed 8-2-10.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1305.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village of Woodsfield and the State of Ohio. Each
day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing
herein contained shall prevent the Village of Woodsfield from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The Village
of Woodsfield shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance
with the penalties stated herein.
