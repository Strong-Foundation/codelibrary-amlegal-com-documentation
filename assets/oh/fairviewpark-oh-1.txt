EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the City Code into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the City Code.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the City Code. It indicates whether a given ordinance was
consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections.
Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given chapter.

ordinance or resolution appropriating money, but otherwise the Mayor’s approval
or disapproval shall be addressed to the entire ordinance or resolution. If the
Mayor does not sign or veto an ordinance or resolution after its passage or
adoption within said ten (10) day period, it shall take effect in the same
manner as if the Mayor had signed it. When the Mayor has disapproved an
ordinance or resolution or part or item thereof, as herein provided, the
Council shall, not later than the next regular meeting, proceed to reconsider
it, and if upon reconsideration the ordinance or resolution or part or item
thereof be approved by vote of a majority plus one of the members elected to
Council, it shall then take effect as if it had received the signature of the
Mayor. In all such cases the vote shall be taken and entered upon the journal.

by this Charter, the ordinances of the City, and the general laws of the State

proposal to sell, convey, lease or rent for a period in excess of one (1) year,
or in any manner alienate, or grant the exclusive use of, any "dedicated park"
or any portion thereof, shall have been processed through the Parks and
Recreation Commission and approval of said proposal has been duly obtained by
the Council from the Commission, or, following its disapproval by said
Commission, said proposal has been affirmatively adopted by Council pursuant to
a majority plus one vote by all members elected to Council for adoption or
authorization, each such proposal shall be suspended and without legal effect

thereon.
   (b)    Matters Not Requiring Vote of Electorate. Following approval by the
Parks and Recreation Commission, or subsequent to disapproval by the Commission
followed by an affirmative adoption or authorization by vote of a majority plus
one of the members elected to Council on said proposal, Council may without
approval of the electorate lease or rent or permit the use of any part of any
"dedicated park" for a period not in excess of one year, to or by any person,
corporation, governmental body or their entity for the operation of any
facility, or the performance of any service or function, incidental to or
congruous with park and recreational usages; or, following such processing
through the Commission, Council may grant and/or convey easements or similar
interests over, under and across "dedicated parks" or any portion thereof, for
the construction, installation and maintenance of sewers and utility lines.

emergency measure of any ordinance or resolution pertaining to any of the
matters requiring referral to the electorate, as set forth in subsection (a) of
this
Section 15 of this Article IV, is prohibited. Matters set forth above in "(b)
Matters Not Requiring Vote of Electorate", shall be subject to passage of
emergency measures, but not until any such matter shall have first been
referred to the Parks and Recreation Commission.
   Whenever Council finds that an emergency is of such nature as to require
approval or disapproval by the Commission within less than sixty (60) days of
any proposed emergency measure relating to matters not subject to mandatory
referral to the electorate, Council shall have the power to call for a meeting
of said Commission within any period of time reasonable under the
circumstances; and the Commission shall then promptly approve or disapprove of
said proposed emergency measure. In the event of disapproval by the Commission,
said proposed emergency measure may nonetheless be affirmatively adopted or
authorized by a majority plus one vote of all members elected to Council.

whether legislative or administrative in nature, a petition, signed by at least
that number of electors which equals ten percent (10%) of the electors voting
at the last preceding general Municipal election, may be filed with the Clerk
of Council, requesting that such ordinance, resolution or other action, whether
legislative or administrative in nature, be either repealed or submitted to a
vote of the electors. If said petition is signed by that number of electors
which equals twenty percent (20%) or more of such electors, the date of the
election may be fixed therein, which shall be not less than ninety (90) days
from the time of filing thereof. When said petition is filed, the Clerk shall
first ascertain the sufficiency of the petition and if found sufficient, the
Council shall thereupon, within thirty (30) days of the filing of such
petition, reconsider such ordinance, resolution or other action. If, upon such
reconsideration, the ordinance, resolution or other action is not repealed, the
Council shall submit it to a vote of the electors on the date fixed in the
petition or, if no date be so fixed, at the first general election in any year

resolution or other action be not approved by a majority of those voting
thereon, it shall be considered repealed as regards any further action
thereunder, but such ordinance, resolution or other action shall be deemed
sufficient authority for payment, in accordance with the ordinance, of any
costs or expense actually incurred previous to the referendum vote thereon, but
not for any in future costs or expenses allegedly incurred or obligated with
respect thereto.
   (b)    Each contract, consent agreement, compact or other means by which the
City of Fairview Park cooperates with, is or becomes a member of any type of,
or contributes to the operation, in any way, of any other governmental unit,
agency or association, including a regional government or agency or group of

referendum as provided in
Article X, Section 2 (a) and in no future obligations with respect thereto
shall be binding upon City or its citizens if said referendum passes.

provisions inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed.

be signed by at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total electors voting at
the last preceding Regular Municipal Election, provided, however, the petition
for recall of a councilperson from a ward shall be signed by at least that
number of electors of the councilperson’s ward equal to twenty-five percent
(25%) in number of the electors of such ward who voted at the last preceding
regular Municipal Election. If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient,
the Clerk shall promptly so certify to the Council, shall deliver a copy of
such certificate to the official whose removal is sought and make a record of
such delivery. If such official shall not resign within five (5) days after the
day on which such delivery shall have been made, the Council shall fix a day
for holding a recall election not less than ninety (90) days, nor more than one
hundred twenty (120) days from the date of delivery. If a majority of the votes
cast shall be voted affirmatively, such official shall remain in office. If a
majority of the votes cast shall be voted negatively, such official shall be
considered as removed, the official’s office shall be deemed vacant and such
vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter. The official removed by
such recall election shall not be eligible for appointment to the vacancy
created thereby. (Amended 11-5-91; 11-5-19)

electors in accordance, in each instance, with the provisions of the
Constitution and laws of Ohio now or hereafter in effect. The Council shall
determine the manner of submission of any proposed amendment or amendments to
the electors to the extent that such submission is not governed by this Charter
or the Constitution or the laws of the State of Ohio.
   If any such proposed amendment or amendments shall be approved by a majority
of the electors voting thereon, it or they shall become a part of this Charter;

Commission who shall record the proceedings of the meetings and serve in any
other secretarial capacity. Sufficient funds should be appropriated by Council

ARTICLE XV
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter, all meetings, whether
regular or special, of the Council, and of all boards, commissions and other
public bodies whether established by ordinance or resolution of Council, by
administrative action, or by this Charter, as well as any committee of any of
the foregoing, shall be open to the public except that an executive session may
be held, in compliance with State statutes, after Council, the board, the
commission, or other public body determines, by a roll call vote in a meeting
open to the public to hold such executive session for the sole purpose of the
consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)    To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
his official duties or for his removal from office. If a public body holds an
executive session pursuant to division (1) of this section, the motion and vote
to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved
purposes listed in division (1) of this section are the purposes for which the
executive session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to
be considered at the meeting.
      (2)    To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a public body shall use this division as a subterfuge
for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase
or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public
property has received covert information from a member of a public body that
has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers. If the minutes of
the public body show that all meetings and deliberations of the public body
have been conducted in compliance with this section, any instrument executed by
the public body purporting to convey, lease, or otherwise dispose of any right,
title, or interest in any public property shall be conclusively presumed to
have been executed in compliance with this section insofar as title or other
interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the property
is concerned.
      (3)    Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning
disputes involving the public body that are the subject to pending or imminent
court action;
      (4)    Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)    Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or rules
or State statutes;
      (6)    Specialized details of security arrangements where disclosure of
the matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the
purpose of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law. If
a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the matters listed
in divisions (2) to (6) of this section, the motion and vote to hold that
executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters listed
in those divisions are to be considered at the executive session. (Added 11-5-
91.)

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included. (ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
       (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise clearly indicates:
   (a)    "Unavailable" means either that a vacancy in office exists and there
is no deputy authorized to exercise all of the powers and discharge the duties
of the office, or that the lawful incumbent of the office, including any deputy
exercising the powers and discharging the duties of an office because of a
vacancy, and his duly authorized deputy are absent or unable, for physical,
mental or legal reasons, to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the
office.
   (b)    "Attack" means any attack or series of attacks by an enemy of the
United States causing, or which may cause, substantial damage or injury to
civilian property or persons in the United States in any manner, by sabotage or
by the use of bombs, missiles, shellfire, or atomic, radiological, chemical,
bacteriological or biological means, or other weapons or processes.
   (c)    "Duly authorized deputy" means a person who is presently authorized
to perform all of the functions, exercise all of the powers and discharge all
of the duties of an office in the event the office is vacant or at such times
as it lacks administration due to the death, absence or disability of the
incumbent officer.
   (d)    "Emergency interim successor" means a person designated, pursuant to
this chapter, for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but
not the office, of a City officer in the event that such officer or any duly
authorized deputy is unavailable to exercise the powers and discharge the
duties of the office.
       (Ord. 62-38. Passed 5-21-62.)
107.02 DESIGNATION, STATUS, QUALIFICATIONS OF SUCCESSORS.

to any duly authorized deputy, designate such number of emergency interim
successors to his office and specify their rank in order of succession after
any duly authorized deputy, so that there will be not less than three duly
authorized deputies or emergency interim successors, or combination thereof,
for the office.
   (b)   Appointive Officers. The Mayor shall, within the time specified in

to insure that at all times there are at least three such qualified emergency
interim successors or duly authorized deputies, or any combination thereof, for
each officer specified.
   (d)    Qualifications. No person shall be designated or serve as an
emergency interim successor unless he may, under the Constitution and statutes
of this State and the Charter or ordinances of this City, hold the office of
the person to whose powers and duties he is designated to succeed, but no
provision of any ordinance prohibiting an officer or employee of this City from
holding another office shall be applicable to an emergency interim successor.
   (e)    Status of Emergency Interim Successor. A person designated as an
emergency interim successor holds that designation at the pleasure of the
designator, provided that he must be replaced if removed. He retains this
designation as emergency interim successor until replaced by another appointed
by the authorized designator.
(Ord. 62-38. Passed 5-21-62.)
107.03 ASSUMPTION OF POWERS AND DUTIES BY SUCCESSOR.

successor highest in rank in order of succession who is not unavailable shall,
except for the power and duty to appoint emergency interim successors, exercise
the powers and discharge the duties of such officer. An emergency interim
successor shall exercise these powers and discharge these duties only until
such time as the lawful incumbent officer or any duly authorized deputy or an
emergency interim successor higher in rank in order of succession exercises, or
resumes the exercise of, the powers and discharge of the duties of the office,
or until, where an actual vacancy exists, a successor is appointed to fill such
vacancy or is elected and qualified as provided by law.

address and rank in order of succession. The City Clerk shall keep on file all
such data regarding duly authorized deputies and emergency interim successors,
and it shall be open to public inspection.
(Ord. 62-38. Passed 5-21-62.)
107.05 FORMALITIES OF TAKING OFFICE.

109.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The proper operation of democratic government requires that all public
officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the
people; that government decisions and policy be made in proper channels of
governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and
that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In
recognition of these goals there is hereby established this Code of Ethics for
all public officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or
unpaid. Accordingly, this Code shall apply to, and regulate the conduct of, all
members of Council, the Mayor, all officers and employees of the City, and all
members of any board, commission or advisory committee or council or the City,
to all of whom the phrase "officials and employees", as used in this Code,
shall be deemed to apply. The purpose of this Code is to establish ethical
standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth
those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the
City. The provisions and purpose of this Code and such rules and regulations as
may be established are hereby declared to be in the best interest of the City.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.02 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC OFFICE.
   The public officials and public employees of the City are agents of public
purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public only. They are bound to
uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, the Constitution and
laws of the State of Ohio and the Charter and laws of the City; and to carry
out impartially the laws of the United States, the State of Ohio and the City
and thus foster respect for government. They are bound to observe in their
official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the
duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that
the public interest shall be their primary concern. Their conduct in their
official affairs should be above reproach.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.03 DEDICATED SERVICE.
   All public officials and public employees of the City should be loyal to the
objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain and
maintain those objectives. Appointive officials and employees shall adhere to
the rules of work and performance established for their positions by the
appropriate authority.
   Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law,
or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other
public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the
officially recognized confidentiality of their work.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.04 FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT.
   No official or employee of the City shall request, use or permit the use of
City owned, leased or controlled vehicles, equipment, materials or property for
personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the
public generally or are provided as municipal policy adopted pursuant to
ordinance for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official
business. No official or employee of the City shall grant any special
consideration, treatment or advantage to any person beyond that which is
available to every other person.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.05 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   No member of Council, the Mayor or other public official or public employee
of the City, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or
transaction or have a financial or personal interest, direct or indirect, which
is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties in the public
interest or which would tend to impair his independence of judgment or action
in the performance of his official duties, without first making a public
disclosure thereof. Personal interest, as distinguished from financial
interest, includes an interest arising from blood, adoption, guardianship or
marriage or close business or political association.
   Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated herein for the guidance of all
public officials and public employees:
   (a)   Holding, engaging in or accepting private employment or rendering
services for or on behalf of private interests where such employment or service
is incompatible with the proper discharge of the official public duties of the
official or employee or which would tend to impair the independence of judgment
or action in the performance of the official duties of the public official or
public employee.
   (b)   Disclose, without appropriate authorization, any information acquired
by the public official or public employee in the course of his official duties
which is confidential because of statutory or ordinance provisions, or when
clearly designated as confidential to him when such confidential designation is
warranted because of the status of the proceedings or the circumstances under
which the information was received and preserving its confidentiality is
clearly necessary to the proper conduct of government business, or use such
information to advance the financial or private interest of the public official
or public employee or others.
   (c)   Solicit, receive, accept or agree to receive or accept or use or
authorize the use of the authority or influence of his office or employment to
secure anything of value or the promise or offer of anything of value for or in
connection with his public service or public employment including, but not
limited to, any gift, service, loan, gratuity, compensation, favor, thing or
promise from any person, partnership, trust, business trust, corporation or
association which to the knowledge of the public official or public employee is
interested, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in business
dealings with the City or that may tend to manifest an influence upon the
public official or employee in the proper discharge of public duties; nor shall
any public official or employee grant in the discharge of public duties any
improper favor, service or thing of value.
   (d)   Engage in the practice of law or represent or otherwise appear in
behalf of a person, partnership, trust, business trust, corporation or
association before any court or administrative agency in which the City is a
party except on behalf of the City as an official or employee; or volunteer

proceeding in which the City is a party; or accept a retainer or other
compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by a City agency,
including Council, administrative department, division or office, board or
commission; or appear before any board, commission or other public body of the
City except in the performance of public obligations or official duties.
      The provisions of this subsection (d) shall not prohibit:
      (1)   An appearance at or participation by a public official or employee
before any department, division, office, board, commission or other City agency
in the discharge of his duties as such public officer or employee and without
private compensation for such appearance or participation, including appearance
or participation on behalf of constituents as a representative of the
electorate.
      (2)   An appearance at or participation by a public official or employee,
on his own behalf, or on behalf of partnership, trust, business trust,
corporation, association or business in which he is a proprietor, partner,
officer or employee before an agency of the City of which he is not a member,
with respect to a matter which is not in conflict with duties as such official
or employee of the City.
   (e)   Acting, directly or indirectly, as attorney, agent, broker or employee
or in any other representative capacity on behalf of any private person,
partnership, trust, business trust, corporation or association interested,
directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in any contract, work or
service, or the sale or acquisition by the City of any property, the cost of
which is payable by City funds or to the City, or, directly or indirectly, be
interested in the profits of any contract, work or service with the City or in
the sale or acquisition by the City of any property, the cost of which is
payable by City funds or to the City. No official or employee of the City
shall, directly or indirectly, have any interest other than his fixed
compensation and reimbursable expenses in any expenditures of funds by the
City. A public official or employee shall not be deemed interested in any
contract, work or service, or the sale or acquisition by the City of any
property, or the profits of any contract, work or service, or the sale or
acquisition by the City of any property unless such is approved, authorized,
awarded or entered into by the public official or public employee in his
official capacity.
   (f)   Within one year after termination of public service or employment, no
public official or employee shall represent a client or act in a representative
capacity or accept private employment or receive private compensation for
services, whether as attorney, agent, broker or employee with respect to any
matter, case, proceeding, application, determination, issue or question in
which he personally participated through decision, approval, disapproval,
recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation or other substantial
exercise of administrative discretion or which was under his charge during the
period of his service as such official or employee.
   (g)   Use of public position for personal gain.
   (h)   Holding (possession of) investments which interfere with or tend to
interfere with the proper discharge of public duty. This shall include
participation in transactions as a public representative with a person,

public official or employee has a direct or indirect financial or other
personal interest.
   (i)   Personal interest in legislation to the extent that private interest
takes precedence over public interest or duty.

partnership, trust, business trust, corporation or association in which the
public official or employee has a controlling or other substantial financial
interest and when the public official or employee can influence such contract
or business because of his public position. "Substantial financial interest"
includes any of the following interests in a business entity: proprietor,
member of a partnership, officer or director of a corporation or association,
trustee of a trust or a shareholder in a corporation whose shares are not
obtainable on a recognized public stock exchange.
   (k)   Soliciting employment with a person, partnership, trust, business
trust, corporation or association doing business with the City over which the
public official or employee had some control in his official capacity within
one year of the termination of public service.
   (l)   Promising any person appointment to any municipal position as a reward
for any political activity.
      (Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.06 DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE INTEREST IN LEGISLATION.
   A member of Council or the City administration including any official or
employee who participates in discussion of or who gives an official opinion to
Council shall publicly disclose on the official records of Council the nature
and extent of any direct or financial interest or other personal or private
right he may have in any legislation pending before Council immediately after
its introduction and prior to passage, provided, however, that such disclosure
shall not deprive the member of Council of his right to vote on such
legislation. A member of Council who elects to abstain regarding such
legislation shall not participate in the consideration of, or take any official
action with respect to such legislation, and shall make the same disclosure as
otherwise required herein. This section shall not be interpreted as permitting
any interest in contracts with the City or in City expenditures prohibited by
Section
109.05.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.07 APPLICABILITY OF CODE.
   When an official or employee of the City has doubt as to the applicability
to a particular situation of a provision of this Code or the City Charter or
any law which establishes ethical standards or otherwise regulates the conduct
of officials or employees of the City, the official or employee should apply to
the Board of Ethics for an advisory opinion and be guided by that opinion when
given. The official or employee shall have the opportunity to present his
interpretation of the facts at issue and of the applicable provisions of this
Code, Charter and law before such advisory decision is made.
   This Code shall be operative in all instances covered by its provisions
except when superseded by an applicable statutory or Charter provision and the
statutory or Charter action is mandatory, or when the application of a
statutory or Charter provision is discretionary but determined to be more
appropriate or desirable.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.08 BOARD OF ETHICS; CREATION, COMPOSITION AND TERM.
   (a)   There is hereby established a Board of Ethics, consisting of three
members who shall be residents of the City and appointed by the Mayor with the
approval of Council. Such members shall serve without compensation for three-
year terms except that of the original appointment, one member shall be
appointed for a three-year term, one shall be appointed for a two-year term,
and one shall be appointed for a one-year term. The Board shall select its own
chair and, subject to the provisions of Section
109.09, set its own rules of procedure.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Board to render advisory opinions with
respect to matters dealing with conflict of interest as set forth in the
Codified Ordinances and to hear complaints against persons as set forth in
Section
109.09. Advisory opinions shall be rendered pursuant to a written request of a
member of Council, or any officer or employee of the City.
(Ord. 91-13. Passed 5-6-91.)
109.09 COMPLAINTS, HEARINGS AND PROCEDURE; OATHS AND SUBPOENAS.
   (a)   The Board of Ethics shall receive complaints against persons subject
to this chapter concerning conduct alleged to be in violation of any provision
of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio statutory law, the City Charter or ordinance of
the City which establishes ethical standards for or otherwise regulates the
conduct of such persons. All complaints shall be filed by affidavit made on
personal knowledge, subject to the penalties of perjury. The Board shall
investigate complaints and charges presented to it.
   (b)   If the Board finds that a complaint is not frivolous, and that the
facts alleged in a complaint, if true, would constitute a violation of any of
the provisions enumerated in this chapter, it shall hold a hearing to determine
whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the facts alleged in the
complaint are true. If the Board does not so find, it shall dismiss the
complaint.
   (c)   The person against whom the complaint is directed shall be given not
less than ten days notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, a
statement of the charges and the law directly involved, and shall be given the
opportunity to be represented by counsel, to examine the evidence against him,
to produce evidence and to call and subpoena witnesses, to confront his
accuser, and to cross-examine witnesses. The Board shall have a stenographic
record made of the hearing. The hearing shall be open to the public except as
otherwise provided by law.
   (d)   If upon the basis of such hearing, the Board finds, based upon a
preponderance of the evidence, that the facts alleged in the complaint are true
and constitute a violation of any provision of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio
statutory law, the City Charter or ordinance of the City which establishes
ethical standards for or otherwise regulates the conduct of persons subject to
the provisions of this chapter, it shall report its findings by written report
to the Mayor, each member of Council and to the accused person.
   (e)   If the Board does not find based upon a preponderance of the evidence
that the facts alleged in the complaint are true and constitute any of the
aforementioned violations, it shall dismiss the complaint and make the report
of that finding public.
   (f)   The Board, or a member of the Board, may administer oaths, and the
Board may issue subpoenas to any person within the State compelling the
attendance of witnesses, and the production of relevant papers, books,
accounts, and records. The Board shall issue any such subpoena upon request of
the accuser or the accused. The provisions of Ohio R.C. 705.21, insofar as
applicable, shall govern the issuance of such subpoenas. Upon refusal of any
person to obey a subpoena or to be sworn or to answer as a witness, the Board
may apply Ohio R.C. 705.21 to enforce compliance. The Board or the accused
person may take depositions of witnesses within or without the state in the
same manner as prescribed by law for the taking of depositions in civil
actions.
   (g)   The Board shall schedule a hearing within ninety days after a
complaint is filed if the Board determines that the facts alleged in a
complaint, if true, would constitute a violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter. The complaint shall be disposed of within ninety days after it
has been heard.
   (h)   All papers, records, affidavits and documents upon any complaint,
inquiry or investigation relating to the proceedings of the Board shall be open
to the public, except as otherwise provided by law.
   (i)   Any complaint regarding a member of Council concerning an alleged
violation of this chapter may, at the option of the accuser, be filed with the
Clerk of Council. Should such a complaint be so filed, the President of Council
or the Presiding Officer shall appoint a special select committee to

conducted at an executive session held in compliance with the Charter and this
chapter.

costs and reasonable attorney's fees and also shall order the public body that
it enjoins to pay a civil forfeiture of one hundred dollars ($100.00). If the
Court of Common Pleas does not issue an injunction pursuant to this section and
the court determines at that time that the bringing of the action was frivolous
conduct as defined in Ohio R.C. 2323.51(A), the court may award to the public
body all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Irreparable harm and
prejudice to the party that sought the injunction shall be conclusively and
irrebuttably presumed upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this
section.

contempt of Council, and may, for such contempt, be censured by a majority vote

Council, that member shall respectfully address themselves to the Presiding
Officer and, when recognized by the Presiding Officer, shall confine themselves

who was first to speak and the exercise of such discretion by the Presiding
Officer shall not be subject to appeal under Rule 27.

ruling of the Presiding Officer. The member making the appeal may briefly state
their reasons for the appeal, and the Presiding Officer may briefly explain the
ruling, but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other member shall
participate in the discussion. The Presiding Officer shall then put the
question; "Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained?" If a majority of the
members present and voting vote "yes" the ruling of the Chair is sustained;
otherwise it is overruled.
      (28)   Rule 28. Division of Question. If the question contains two or
more divisible propositions, the Presiding Officer may, and upon request of a
member shall, divide the same; but a motion to strike out a provision and

comprehends a question so distinct that if one is taken away, the other shall
stand as an entire question for decision.
      (29)   Rule 29. Personal Privilege.  Any member may rise to explain a
matter personal to themselves, and on stating that it is a matter of personal
privilege, they shall be recognized by the Presiding Officer, but shall not
discuss a question or issue in such explanation. Such explanation shall not

to the amendment. When the previous question is demanded and seconded on the
main question, it shall be put as follows: "Shall the main question be now
put?" If the motion for the previous question is carried as to the main
question, there shall be no further amendment or debate, but pending amendments
shall be put in their order before the main question. If the question, "Shall
the main question be now put?" or "Shall the amendment be now put?" be decided

postponement, but not upon the merits of the legislation or other matter; may
be amended by changing the date; and shall be subject to the previous question.

matter shall be considered in the regular order of business of that day.

voting. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be reconsidered only if decided
in the affirmative, shall be debatable and shall open the legislation or other
matter to debate; may be renewed after intervening business and may not be
amended or laid on the table, and shall be subject to previous question.

was taken. A motion to reconsider may be made only by any member who voted with
the prevailing side. A motion to reconsider shall be in order at any time
except when a motion on some other subject is standing. A motion to reconsider,
being laid on the table, may be taken up and acted upon at any time in

miscellaneous business. No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on
any matter or subject, and the same number of votes shall be required to
reconsider the action of Council as was required to pass or adopt the same. A
motion to reconsider may not be applied to a motion to adjourn, a motion to
suspend the rules or a motion to lay on the table.

A question of privilege shall not require a second and shall be decided by the
President of Council subject to a right of appeal as set forth in Rule 27.
      (40)   Rule 40. Motion that Matter be Taken From Committee. When any
ordinance, resolution or other matter has been referred to a committee, and the

Council meeting from the date of referral to report, or to offer a valid reason
for its failure to report, any member of Council shall have the right to make a
motion that such ordinance, resolution or other matter be taken from the
committee to which such ordinance, resolution or other matter has been referred
and that the same may be laid before Council for action. Such motion shall be
decided without debate, provided that the member making the motion may state
briefly the reasons for the motion.
      (41)   Rule 41. Motion to Take From Table. A motion to take from the
table shall be in order when that order of business is being transacted in

motion.
      (42)   Rule 42. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn shall always be in

recommendation for approval or disapproval. When so reported, such ordinance,
resolution, communication or other matter shall be read a second time and,
except as provided in Rule 56, laid over until the next meeting of Council when
it shall be read a third time and a vote taken thereon. No ordinance,
resolution, communication or other matter shall be enacted or otherwise adopted
or further action taken thereon without first having been referred to committee
and reported upon, except for a resolution of condolence or congratulations or

Suspension of the Rules and Without Readings on Three Different Days" portion
of "The Agenda."
      (53-1)   Rule 53-1. Re-reference to Committee.  Any pending legislation,
communication or other matter may, by the President of Council or by a vote of
a majority of the members elected to Council present and voting, be re-referred

communication or other matter shall have the same standing as it had at the
time when re-referred. Such legislation, communication or other matter shall be
subject to the provisions of Rule 17 and Rule 55.

         A.   Any committee or committees to which an ordinance, resolution,
communication or other matter has been referred by the Presiding Officer under
Rule 53, without specific motion to commit, may be relieved of further
consideration of such legislation, communication or other matter by a motion
duly made and adopted by a majority plus one vote of the members elected to
Council; provided a majority vote of the members elected to Council present and
voting shall be sufficient to relieve a committee if notice of the intention to
relieve such committee or committees of further consideration of said
legislation, communication or other matter has been made at the meeting
preceding the meeting at which such motion is made.
         B.   Any committee to which an ordinance, resolution, communication or
other matter has been referred by motion to commit or recommit may be relieved
of further consideration of such legislation, communication or other matter at
the next meeting following the meeting at which such legislation was referred
by a motion to reconsider the vote to commit or recommit as the case may be,
which motion shall require only a majority vote of the members elected to
Council present and voting; and at any time subsequent to the meeting next
succeeding the meeting at which such legislation, communication or other matter
has been committed or recommitted, the procedure to relieve the committee shall
be as provided in subsection (a)(55)A. hereof.
         C.   In the event any committee is relieved of further consideration
pursuant to either subsection (a)(55)A. or B. hereof, such ordinance,
resolution, communication or other matter shall be placed on the Calendar

directed by Council.
      (56)   Rule 56. Three Readings. Copies of all first reading legislation
to be introduced for passage under suspension of the Rules and without reading

personally or at their residence address, or transmitted by electronic means,
at least two days prior to the date of introduction. No motion to suspend the
Rule that first reading legislation be read on three different days shall be
entertained unless the reason for the suspension is set forth in accordance
with Rule 46 by the member making such motion or the official or the Director
of the department involved. When it is desired to suspend Rule 49 and Rule 53,
in order to permit the passage of legislation upon introduction, the question
on the motions for suspension shall be as follows:
   "Shall the Charter provision and Rule 49 requiring reading on three
different days be dispensed with?" If a majority plus one of the members
elected to Council, vote "yes", the Charter and the Rule provisions requiring
reading on three different days shall be suspended and the question on the
motion to suspend Rule 53 shall be as follows: "Shall Rule 53 requiring
reference to Committee be dispensed with and (Ordinance No. - ) (Resolution No.
- ) be placed on final passage?" If a majority plus one of the members of
Council present and voting vote "yes", the Rule requiring reference to
Committee shall be suspended. Both motions set forth in this paragraph shall be
debatable as to the propriety of same but not upon the merits of the
legislation. Copies of all second reading legislation to be placed for passage
under suspension of the Rules and without reading on three different days shall
be delivered to each member of Council either personally, or at their residence
address, or transmitted by electronic means, two days prior to the date of
second reading. No motion to suspend the rule that second reading legislation
be read on three different days shall be entertained unless the reason for the
suspension is set forth in accordance with Rule 46-1 by the committee
recommending such motion. When it is desired to suspend Rule 49, in order to
permit the passage of legislation upon second reading, the question on the
motion for suspension shall be as follows: "Shall the Charter provision and
Rule 49 requiring reading on three different days be dispensed with?" If a
majority plus one of the members elected to Council, vote "yes", the Charter
and Rule provisions requiring reading on three different days shall be
suspended. The motion set forth in this paragraph shall be debatable as to the
propriety of same but not upon the merits of the legislation.
      (57)   Rule 57. Appropriation Ordinances and Resolutions. Ordinances or
resolutions making appropriations shall be confined to the subject of
appropriations and must include a fund number from which it will be paid. No
money shall be appropriated except by ordinance or resolution. All ordinances

of bonds, the transfer of money to any fund, or the payment of claims, and all
resolutions and ordinances whereby the City shall become liable for the payment
of any money, shall be referred without debate to the Committee on Finance for
consideration and report.
      (58)   Rule 58. Substitute Legislation. Legislation dealing with the same
subject matter may be substituted for any pending ordinance or resolution by a
majority vote of the members elected to Council present and voting, upon the
recommendation of any committee to which such legislation has been referred.
Substitute legislation shall be subject to all the provisions of the Charter,
ordinances and rules applying to ordinances or resolutions to be placed on
first reading, and the legislation for which such substitute is offered shall
be laid upon the table permanently as a final disposition thereof. Before
accepting for introduction any substitute legislation, the sponsor or sponsors
of the original legislation shall be given written notice thereof by the Clerk
of Council.
      (59)   Rule 59. Ordinances Fixing Fines and Penalties. All ordinances
imposing fines, penalties, forfeiture or imprisonment shall be referred to the
appropriate standing committee of Council as provided for in Rule 14, and the
Director of Law shall be asked to give an opinion thereon.
      (60)   Rule 60. Approval of Ordinances and Resolutions. Every ordinance
passed or resolution adopted shall be signed by the President of Council or
other Presiding Officer and presented promptly to the Mayor by the Clerk of
Council. If the Mayor approves such ordinance or resolution, the Mayor shall
sign and return it to the Clerk of Council within ten days after its passage or
adoption by Council, but if the Mayor does not approve it, he the Mayor shall
return it to Council within such ten days with his or her written objections by
delivery to the Clerk of Council. The Mayor's objections shall be read at the
next Council meeting and be entered in full on the journal of Council. The
Mayor may approve or disapprove the whole or any item of an ordinance or
resolution appropriating money, but otherwise his or her approval or
disapproval shall be addressed to the entire ordinance or resolution. If the
Mayor does not return an ordinance or resolution within the time limited in
this Rule, it shall take effect in the same manner as if he or she had signed
it. When the Mayor disapproves an ordinance or resolution or any part thereof,
and returns it to the Council with his or her objections, Council shall, not
later than the next regular meeting, reconsider it and, if such ordinance,
resolution or item, upon such reconsideration, is approved by the vote of at
least a majority plus one members elected to Council, it shall take effect at
the time of the vote of approval or at such later time as may be specified in
such ordinance, resolution or item.

heating, ventilating and air conditioning by reference to the date and source
of the code without reproducing the same at length in the ordinance. In all
such cases, publication of the code at length by the City shall not be
required. In any such instance at least ten copies of such code shall be kept
in the Building Department for reference by interested parties, and copies

administrative officers for recommendation and report. No later than thirty
days after reference to the administrative officer or officers, as the case may
be, each ordinance, resolution or communication so referred shall be returned
to the Clerk of Council with the endorsement of each administrative officer's
approval, disapproval or recommended changes of such matter so referred; if
response is not received within thirty days, Council shall assume that approval
is granted. It shall be the duty of the President of Council to enforce this
rule rigidly. The Clerk shall use all diligence in seeing that departments,

of the appropriate order of business, shall proceed to vote upon the approval
of each appointment, the question being "Shall the Council approve the
appointment by the Mayor?" Except as provided by the Charter or an ordinance or

113.01 REQUIREMENT FOR LEGAL PUBLICATION IN NEWSPAPER.
   Whenever any legal publication or notice is required by the Charter, City
Ordinances, or by virtue of the laws of the State to be made in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City, such legal publication or notice shall be made
in either the Plain Dealer, the Sun-Herald, the West Life or any other
newspaper of general circulation in the City.
(Ord. 89-8. Passed 3-6-89.)
113.02 PREFERENCE FOR AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCTS.
   (a)    The purpose of this section is to require the procurement of domestic
source end products for public use except as otherwise provided in this
section. This section shall not be construed so as to impair the ability of the
City to reject all bids, offers and proposals, award partial bids, offers and
proposals, and rebid, re-request and resolicit if it is deemed in the best
interest of the City to do so.
   (b)    Unless the Board of Control when public bidding, public solicitation
for offers or public request for proposals is required shall determine it to be
inconsistent with the public interest, or the price to be excessive, only such
unmanufactured end products as have been mined or produced in the United
States, and only such manufactured end products as have been manufactured in
the United States substantially all from components mined, produced or
manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States shall be acquired for
public use by the City. The requirements of this section shall not apply if the
end products of the class or kind to be used or the components from which they
are manufactured are not mined, produced or manufactured, as the case may be,
in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial
quantities or of a satisfactory quality or where there is not sufficient
competition in the United States.
   (c)    Bids or offered prices shall first be evaluated to determine that a
bid or offered price is for a domestic source end product. Any bid, proposal or
offer that does not meet this requirement shall be rejected, except in those
circumstances where the Board determines that certain end products, or any
component thereof, are not mined, produced or manufactured in the United States
in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities or of a
satisfactory quality or where there is not sufficient competition in the United
States. Where the preliminary analysis by the Board identifies the apparent
lowest and best bid, proposal or offer as one other than a domestic source end
product bid, proposal or offer, the Board shall consider:
      (1)    Whether the end product can be acquired in the United States in
sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality;
      (2)    Whether the lowest and best domestic bid, proposal or offer offers
an excessive price;
      (3)    Whether a domestic bid, proposal or offer has been submitted to
the City;
      (4)    Whether the lowest and best domestic bid, proposal or offer offers
an end product of an unsatisfactory quality; and
      (5)    Whether there is sufficient competition within the United States.
   Where the Board determines that selection of the lowest and best domestic
source end product bid, proposal or offer will not result in an excessive price
to the City or the acquisition of an end product of an unsatisfactory quality,
and that the exceptions to the requirements of this section as hereinbefore set
forth do not apply, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder
or offeror of a domestic source end product. Where the Board determines that
selection of the lowest and best domestic source end product bid, proposal or
offer will result in an excessive price to the City or the acquisition of an
end product of an unsatisfactory quality or that one or more of the exceptions
to the requirements of this section as hereinbefore set forth do apply, the
Board shall award the contract to the lowest and best bidder or offeror without
regard to the provisions of this section.
   (d)    All invitations to bid, requests for proposals and solicitations for
offers shall require the bidder or offeror to complete and attest to the
following:
"The bidder (or offeror) hereby certifies that each end product, except the end
products listed below, is a domestic source end product and that components of
an unknown origin have been considered to have been mined, produced or
manufactured outside the United States."
   (e)    In any case in which it is determined that the acquisition of
domestic source end products would be inconsistent with the public interest, or
the price to be excessive, the Board shall submit a written report of the facts
of each case in which such determination is made within ten days thereafter to
Council.
   (f)    If the Board which has authorized any contract containing the
requirements of this section finds that in the performance of such contract
there has been a failure to comply with such requirements, the Board shall make
public its findings, including therein the name of the obliger under such
contract, and no other contract for the acquisition of end products shall be
awarded to such obliger or to any person with which the obliger is associated
or affiliated within a period of three years after such finding is made public.
   (g)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Components" means those articles, materials and supplies which
are directly incorporated in end products.
      (2)    "Domestic bid" means a bid or offered price for a domestic source
end product, including transportation to destination.
      (3)    "Domestic source end product" means an unmanufactured end product
which has been mined or produced in the United States, or an end product
manufactured in the United States if the cost of its components which are
mined, produced or manufactured in the United States exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the cost of components. The cost of components shall include the
transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product and, in
the case of components of foreign origin, duty. A component shall be considered
to have been mined, produced or manufactured in the United States if the end
product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and
the component is of a class or kind:
         A.    Determined by the Board to be not mined, produced or
manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available
commercial quantities or of satisfactory quality; or
         B.    As to which the Board has determined that it would be
inconsistent with the public interest to require.
      (4)    "End products" means articles, materials, supplies and equipment
to be acquired for public use, as specified in the contract, including
articles, materials, supplies and equipment to be acquired for public use in
connection with service contracts, whether of a manufactured or of an
unmanufactured nature, and whether to be acquired by purchase, lease or lease
with an option or agreement to purchase. In determining whether an end product
is a "domestic source end product" only the end product and its components, if
any, shall be considered.
      (5)    "Excessive price" means a price that exceeds by more than five
percent (5%) of the sum or offered price, including duty, of end products of
foreign origin. When more than one line item is offered in response to an
invitation to bid, request for proposals or solicitation for offers, the factor
of five percent (5%) may be applied to any item or group of items as to which
the invitation to bid, request for proposals or solicitation for offers
specifically provides that award is to be made on a particular item or group of
items.
      (6)    "Foreign bid" means a bid or offered price for a foreign end
product, including transportation to destination and duty.
      (7)    "Foreign end product" means an end product other than a domestic
source end product.
      (8)    "Inconsistent with the public interest" means the end product
offered is of an unsatisfactory quality, or can not be acquired in sufficient
and reasonably available quantities or there is not sufficient competition
within the United States.
      (9)    "Scrap" generated in, collected in and prepared for processing in
the United States shall be considered as a domestic source end product/
component.
      (10)   “Sufficient competition" means two or more qualified bids or
offered prices from bidders or offerors not owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by the same interests, that offer domestic source end products.
      (11)    "United States" means any state, district, commonwealth,
territory, insular possession thereof, and any area subject to the legislative
authority of the United States of America.

113.02, any expenditure required to be made pursuant to contract by
Article VIII, Section 6 of the Charter shall be made with the lowest responsive
and responsible bidder. A bidder on a contract shall be considered as
responsive if the bid responds to bid specifications in all material respects

inspector of licenses, or a policeman of the Police Department, exhibit his
license and photograph for inspection. All applications for such commission as
private policemen and/or private policewomen shall be notarized, and failure to
list arrests, and/or any other information desired by the Police Chief, would
be considered falsifying the application, and the applicant shall be subject to
arrest. All applicants for special police work as such private policemen and
private policewomen shall be fingerprinted and the Police Chief through his
Police Department shall cause a complete record check made of the applicant's
character, or obtain any other information he may desire.

alarms, hold-up alarms, occurrence of fire or for similar purposes; and when
any line is designated as provided for in subsection (a) hereof, persons may,
upon proper application and compliance with applicable laws, be granted a
permit to install a device or devices which automatically select the designated
telephone line for purpose of playing a recorded message or to otherwise report
an intrusion or other emergency.
       (2)    Except as otherwise provided herein, no person shall install,
operate, maintain, use or otherwise cause any telephone device or telephone
attachment that automatically selects any telephone line allocated by the

having a key to the building where the alarm is installed can normally be
found. A third number subject to the approval of the Chief of Police may be
programmed for the next dialing. No more than three such dialings may be
programmed except under unusual circumstances and upon approval of the Chief of
Police. No enforcement agency other than the City Police Department may be
selected.
      (6)    The cost of providing the service described above, including any
fee or payment charged by the telephone company, shall be paid by the

connection payable at the beginning of each calendar year or prorated from the
date of the connection for that year.
      (2)    Each person or firm connecting to such system shall be responsible
for the maintenance and operation of their respective signal line. If any
signal line becomes inoperative or in a state of disrepair, the party
maintaining such a line shall be given notice of such disrepair and shall from
that point be given thirty days to either repair such line or give the Chief of
Police notice of a good faith attempt to repair such line and intentions for
any further action.
      (3)    If payment, as outlined in subsection (c)(1) hereof is not made in
compliance with that subsection, noncompliance regarding subsection (c)(4)
hereof shall be deemed to have taken place.

      (1)    Except as provided in subsection (e)(3) hereof, a charge of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be assessed for each accidental/false alarm
received through equipment described above, or for each accidental/false alarm
received through any other alarm service which the City has given permission to
be installed. Such fee shall be assessed against the owner, agent or person in
charge of or in possession of the premises from which the accidental/false
alarm has emanated.

other recognized testing laboratory. An applicant shall be required to submit
evidence of the reliability and suitability of the equipment to be installed.
      (2)    The sensory mechanism used in connection with any alarm system
shall be maintained to suppress false indications of heat, fire, smoke or
intrusion so that the alarm system will not be activated by impulses due to
transient pressure change in water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises,
vehicular noise or other forces unrelated to a genuine alarm. The sensitivity
of an alarm system shall not be such that the simple vibration or motion of a
protected door or window shall cause the activation of the alarm system without
the actual breaking or opening leading to forcible entry.
      (3)    All components comprising any alarm system shall be maintained by
the owner and/or lessee in good repair to assure reliability of operation.
      (4)    Every alarm business that sells or leases to any person any alarm
system which is installed on such person's residence or place of business shall

system operates, along with the maintenance instructions. "Alarm business"
means and includes any business engaged in any of the activities of selling,
leasing, leasing with an option to purchase, installing, servicing, altering,
repairing, maintaining, replacing, moving, monitoring, responding to a fire,

furnish the Chief of Police with a copy of the instructions as to the manner in
which the alarm system operates. If the Chief finds such to be incomplete,
unclear or inadequate, he shall require the alarm business to have same revised
to meet his approval and then promptly have copies distributed to persons for
whom installations of such systems are made.
      (6)    No person shall manually activate an alarm system for any reason
other than the occurrence of an event for which such alarm system was installed
and intended.
      (7)    Any alarm business that sells or leases to any person an alarm
system which is installed on such person's residence or business shall provide
for the receiving of calls for service, maintenance or repairs, whether
directly or through an agent, on a twenty-four hour, seven day a week basis and
shall respond to such calls within four hours of the time such are received.
Such alarm system shall be installed in accordance with all applicable laws of
the City.
      (8)    At the time of installation of any alarm system, the alarm
business shall furnish to the person for whom the alarm system has been
installed, written information as to how service, maintenance or repair can be
obtained at any time, including the telephone number to call for such service,
maintenance or repair. Such person shall be responsible for having the alarm
system serviced, maintained or repaired after it is learned from any source,
including the City, that the alarm system is not operating properly.
      (9)    All alarm systems shall be maintained in good operating condition,
in the manner for which such system was designed and in compliance with City
building and electrical codes. The Chief of Police shall require that repairs
be made when the Chief determines such are necessary to assure proper
operation.
       (10)    For a violation of this section, for failure to properly
maintain any installation, or when the number of accidental/false alarms
reaches six in any twelve month period, or three in any sixty day consecutive
period, the Chief of Police shall serve written notice upon a permit holder of
intent to revoke their permit. Such notice shall be given not less than seven
days prior to revocation. Such notice shall state the right of the permit
holder to appeal to the Mayor. If an appeal is filed in writing, the Mayor
shall hold a hearing on the matter and shall render a decision on the basis of
the facts presented. The Mayor’s decision shall be final. No person shall
operate an alarm system during the period in which the permit for such alarm
system has been revoked.
   (g)    Liability of City. The issuance of any permit or permits in
conjunction with this section shall not constitute acceptance by the City of
any liability to maintain any equipment, to answer alarms or for anything in
connection therewith.
   (h)    Rules and Regulations. The Police Chief or his authorized
representative shall make and enforce such rules and regulations as he may deem
necessary for the enforcement of the provisions hereof, and for the proper
determination and collection of the fees and charges herein provided.
   (i)    Permit and Inspection Fee. A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be
paid to the City for each permit issued as provided herein, to cover
administrative and inspection costs. A separate permit and fee shall be

pursuant to Federal or State law, rule or regulation, may install any such
specialized equipment thus mandated, and such costs of installation,
maintenance, repair and operation shall be borne solely by the institution
installing the same.
      (2)    In the event that the specialized equipment permitted in
subsection (j)(1) is installed over or upon City property, the Police Chief
shall have full, complete and final authority to mandate the placement of such
specialized equipment, the continuous inspection of the same as may be
necessary, and the repair or replacement of inoperative or damaged equipment,
the same being at the sole expense of the financial institution placing such
specialized equipment.
      (3)    A financial institution which places specialized alarm equipment
over or upon property of the City may, at any reasonable time, remove such
specialized equipment from City property, but no fee previously charged for
such installation or permit, or portion of such fee, shall be refundable to
such financial institution.
      (4)    All financial institutions coming within the purview of this
subsection (j) shall remain amenable to all other provisions of this chapter
and shall make whatever application, receive whatever permits, and pay whatever

   The specifications of the classes of positions in the employee
classification plan and their various parts shall be used as a guide in the
classification of positions and have the following force and effect:
   (a)   The specifications are descriptive and not restrictive. They are
intended to indicate the kinds of positions that are allocated to the several
classes as determined by their duties and responsibilities and shall not be
construed as declaring to any extent or in any way what the minimum or maximum
duties or responsibilities of any position shall be or as limiting or in any
way modifying the power of any appointing authority or administrative officer
to assign, direct and control the work of employees under his/her supervision.
The use of a particular expression or illustration shall not be held to exclude
others not mentioned that are of a similar kind or quality.
   (b)   In determining the class to which any position should be allocated,
the specifications of each class shall be considered as a whole. Consideration
shall be given to the duties, specific tasks, responsibilities, qualification
requirements and relationships to other classes as together affording a
statement of the employment that the class is intended to embrace.

143.06 USE OF THE PLAN.

143.07 MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAN.
   The directors of the various administrative departments, together with the
Mayor, and in the case of the Clerk of Council and other employees of Council,
the President of Council, shall be responsible for the proper maintenance of
the Employee Classification Plan so that it will reflect continuously the
duties currently being performed by each employee in the City in the class to
which each person is allocated. Each director of an administrative department
shall propose to the Mayor necessary amendments to the Employee Classification
Plan, including the addition of new classes, revision of existing classes,
deletion of obsolete classes, and changes in class specifications as follows:
   (a)   The director of an administrative department shall, within sixty (60)
days of the creation of a new position in the department, complete or approve a
written position description of the duties and responsibilities of such
position to be forwarded to the office of the Mayor. The Mayor shall allocate
the position to one of the classes in the Classification Plan. If a suitable
class does not exist, he shall establish a new class and allocate the position
to it.
   (b)   Changes in the duties and responsibilities of a position involving the
addition, reduction, modification of assignments shall be reported to the Mayor
by the director of the administrative department concerned. If the changes are
determined to be permanent and are sufficiently significant to justify re-
allocation to a different classification, the Mayor shall assign the position
to the class which is appropriate under the modified circumstances.
   (c)   The director of each administrative department shall periodically
review or cause to be reviewed the classification of positions and shall audit
duties and responsibilities of each change in the class specifications as
required and shall recommend to the Mayor such changes as are necessary to keep
the Employee Classification Plan current.
   (d)   The Mayor may require administrative departments or employees to
submit position descriptions on a periodic basis or anytime he has reason to
believe there has been a change in the duties and responsibilities of any
position. The Mayor shall direct the grading and classifying of all positions
of the City's service at least once every five (5) years on a cyclical basis.
   (e)   Any employee may request in writing a classification review of his/her
position at any time providing the position has not been reviewed within the
previous twelve (12) months. The director of the administrative department
shall forward the request to the Mayor within ten (10) days of receipt. The
Mayor shall act on any request involving an individual position within sixty
(60) days and on any request involving several positions, as promptly as
possible after receipt of such request. Changes in duty assignments must be
more than temporary in nature and the incumbent must be performing the duties
for the duration of not less than one month to warrant investigation.
   (f)   The assignment of duties to a position whether the duties are
temporary or permanent, incidental or essential, the location of work, the type
of equipment and tools to be used and the scheduling of shift assignments shall
be wholly the responsibility of the Director, the Police or Fire Chief in the
case of those Departments, and the President of Council with respect to
employees of Council, including the Clerk of Council. The classification plan
shall in no way operate or be construed to operate, to limit or interfere with
his/her responsibility for the assignment of duties.
   (g)   With reference to employees of Council, including the Clerk of
Council, the President of Council shall discharge the duties and obligations
imposed upon directors of administrative departments by subsections (a) through
(e) hereof and the Council shall discharge the duties and obligations imposed
upon the Mayor in such subsections.
      (Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.08 AMENDMENTS TO POSITION CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   The establishment of a new class of positions or the abolishment of a
current class of positions shall be made by amendment to the Classification
Plan. When a filled position is re-allocated, the action shall be administered
as though the original position was abolished and a new position with a
different classification established.
(Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.09 ALLOCATION APPEALS.
   If an administrative employee believes his/her position has been improperly
allocated or re-allocated to a class, the employee may appeal to the Civil
Service Commission. The procedure for such appeals shall be as follows:
   (a)   A written appeal shall be prepared and filed with the Secretary of the
Civil Service Commission within thirty (30) days of the date upon which the
employee was notified of this class allocation or re-allocation.
   (b)   The appeal shall set forth the reasons therefore.
   (c)   The Civil Service Commission shall consider all appeals and shall
provide reasonable opportunity for the appellant and appellee to be heard.
   (d)   The Civil Service Commission shall notify the appellant and appellee
in writing of its decision which shall be final. Any decision of the Civil
Service Commission under this provision which allocates a position of an
employee to a different class in the Employee Classification Plan shall be
retroactive to the date the appeal was filed unless otherwise ordered by the
Civil Service Commission.
      (Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.10 DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF COMPENSATION RANGES.
   The compensation range for each position shall be determined by Council with
due regard for ranges of pay of other position classes, relative difficulty and
responsibility of each position in each class, availability of employees in
particular occupational categories, prevailing rates of similar employment in
private establishments in the Fairview Park area and the municipal service of
other public jurisdictions in the general area, cost of living factors, the
financial policies of the City and other economic considerations.
   The Mayor shall make comparative studies of factors affecting the level of
salary ranges as often as necessary and shall submit his/her recommendations to
Council for its action.
(Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.11 APPOINTMENT RATE.
   The minimum rate established for a class shall be paid upon appointment
except that appointment rates above or below the minimum rate may be authorized
by the Mayor upon the written request of a Director of a Department, or in the
case of an employee of Council, including the Clerk of Council, may be
authorized by action of Council.
   (a)   Appointments above the minimum rate.
      Approval for appointments above the minimum rate shall be based upon
exceptional qualifications of the appointee or inability to employ eligible
candidates at the minimum rate.
   (b)   Appointments below the minimum rate.
      Approval for appointments below the minimum rate may be made where the
candidate possesses less than the minimum acceptable qualifications for a
classification. Such appointments shall be made on a trainee basis. When it is
determined by the Mayor, the director of the employing administrative
department or the President of Council that the trainee is able to function on
a full performance basis, he/she may be advanced to the regular minimum rate.
      (Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.12 WITHIN-RANGE INCREASE.
   Salary adjustments within an established range shall not be automatic but
shall be dependent upon formal recommendation of the director of the employing
administrative department to the Mayor, or in the case of an employee of
Council, the Council. Any employee whose job performance is satisfactory shall
be advanced within the steps in his/her assigned pay range and shall be based
on the performance rating given pursuant to standards of performance
established by the Mayor for administrative department employees and the
President of Council for employees of Council, including the Clerk of Council.
The employee shall be informed of the reasons for withholding an increase and
the improvement in performance required to obtain a satisfactory rating.
General increases or decreases resulting from the adjustment of the basic
compensation schedules shall not prevent within-range increases in accordance
with this section.
(Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.13 PAY RATES AND TRANSFER, PROMOTION OR DEMOTION.
   If an employee is transferred, promoted or demoted upon the recommendation
of the director of the employing administrative department and approval by the
Mayor, or, in the case of an employee of Council, including the Clerk of
Council, upon the recommendation of the President of Council and approval of
Council, the employee's pay for the new position shall be determined as
follows:
   (a)   If the rate of pay in the former class is less than the minimum rate
established for the class of the new position, the rate of pay shall be
advanced to the minimum for the class.
   (b)   If the rate of pay in the former class is more than the maximum rate
established for the new class, the pay shall be reduced to the maximum rate or
an intermediate rate of the new range.
   (c)   If the rate of pay in the former class falls within the new rate of
pay, the salary rate shall remain the same in the case of transfer and shall be
increased in the case of a promotion and shall remain the same or adjusted to a
lower step in case of a demotion.
      (Ord. 89-10. Passed 6-17-91.)
143.14 PART-TIME EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Employees of the City, except as provided in subsection (b) hereof,
who were hired on a part-time basis, shall be paid only such part of the rate
of full-time employees in the same position class as is proportionate to the

class during a regular pay period. Part-time employees may be paid on an hourly
or salary basis as shall be determined by the director of the department in
which such employee is hired. The hourly rate of a part-time employee shall be

by dividing the regular number of work week hours for full-time employees in

of such full-time position.

Council, and the director of any administrative department with the approval of

position classification be established for such part-time work together with a
specific rate of pay schedule which position schedule classification shall be
designated as part-time. For a separate position classification for which a
rate of pay is established for a specific part-time position, the provisions of
subsection (a) hereof shall not apply.

furnish a satisfactory written, signed statement to justify the use of sick
leave. If medical attention is required, a certificate stating the nature of
the illness from a licensed physician may be required to justify the use of

dismissal. No sick leave shall be granted an employee upon or after retirement
or termination of employment.
   (g)   An employee from the State or any of its political subdivisions to the
City shall be credited with the unused balance of accumulated sick leave up to

   (l)   In the event any employee has been off duty for a serious injury or
disease or any employee has suffered loss of limb or sight or physical or

circumstances which prevent the employee from otherwise using the vacation
leave as provided herein. For the purpose of calculating vacation leave, only
such time as the employee has in continuous service with the City shall be
utilized and, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 9.44, no credit for previous
employment other than with the City shall be given provided, however, that any
part-time service with the City shall be credited toward vacation leave on a
pro-rata basis.

   (g)   In the last calendar year of any person’s employment with the City,
the vacation pay to which the employee will be entitled in addition to any
unused vacation leave will depend of the amount of time worked since the last
anniversary date of employment of the employee. The number of days elapsing
between the last anniversary date and the end of the last day of employment,
divided by the number of days in the calendar year multiplied by the number of
normal vacation days for that person will determine the number of vacation days
for which the employee is paid. A terminal fraction of five-tenths (.5) or more
will be raised to a full day and a terminal fraction of less than five-tenths
(.5) will be dropped.

shall constitute a forfeiture of all benefits of holiday pay under this
section. Failure of an employee to work on a scheduled work day preceding and
the scheduled work day succeeding the holiday, unless excused by the Mayor or

shall constitute a forfeiture of all benefits of holiday pay under this

any calendar year. Application for military leave shall be submitted to the
director of the employing department at least thirty (30) days in advance of
the proposed leave.
   (b)   If compensation by any military authority given during the period of
leave is less than the regular compensation which would have been given by the
City for such period, the employee shall be paid by the City the difference in
cash money between the regular pay and the military pay. Should the military
compensation exceed the regular compensation from the City, the employee shall
not be required to reimburse the City with such differential in cash money.
Reimbursed expenses, travel and subsistence pay and all other similar
allowances shall not be considered in determining the amount of pay received
for such service, training, or active duty. The provisions of this section

Commission the name of the classified employee who is on any leave of absence
without pay which extends for one (1) pay period or longer and the subsequent

System ("PERS") are hereby modified as follows, in order to provide for a

   (b)   The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each such
employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contracts
and applicable City policies. Such total annual salary and salary per pay
period of each employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: (1) deferred

that percentage of such employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period
which is required from time to time by PERS to be paid as an employee and shall
be paid by the City to PERS on behalf of such employee as a pick-up and in lieu

employee's cash salary shall be equal to such employee's total annual salary or
salary per pay period less the amount of the pick-up for such employee and
shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to such employee.
The City shall compute and remit its employer contributions to PERS based upon

be mandatory for all of the employees previously described who are members of
the PERS. No such member shall have the option of choosing to receive the
contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the City to PERS.
   (e)   The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
Federal, State and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of
such reporting and withholding, it being the City's understanding that Federal
and Ohio income tax laws and regulations presently require it to report as an
employee's gross income his total annual salary less the amount of the pick-up
while applicable municipal income tax laws require it to report as an
employee's gross income his total annual salary including the amount of the
pick-up.
   (f)   The Mayor, or his designee, is hereby directed to take all acts
necessary and appropriate to initiate implementation of the provisions of this
section, including but not limited to making applications to the board
administering the PERS program to determine the requirements of that board in
connection with such pick-up plan.
   (g)   The pick-up plan shall apply to all eligible employees who qualify
under this section and the plan shall commence once the Internal Revenue
Service has ruled that the City's plan meets the qualifications of Section 414
(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and Revenue Regulations 81-35 and 81-36.

pick-up of employees contributions to PERS or PFDPF.
   (b)   The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each such
employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contracts
and applicable City policies. Such total annual salary and salary per pay
period of each employee shall be payable by the City in two parts: (1) deferred
salary and (2) cash salary. An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to
that percentage of such employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period
which is required from time to time by PERS or PFDPF to be paid as an employee
and shall be paid by the City to PERS or PFDPF on behalf of such employee as a
pick-up and in lieu of the PERS or PFDPF employee contribution otherwise
payable by such employee. An employee's cash salary shall be equal to such
employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period less the amount of the
pick-up for such employee and shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll
deductions, to such employee. The City shall compute and remit its employer
contributions to PERS or PFDPF based upon an employee's total annual salary or
salary per pay period, including the aforesaid pick-up. The City's total
combined expenditures for such employees' total salaries otherwise payable
under their contracts and applicable City policies (including pick-up amounts)
and its employer contributions to PERS or PFDPF shall not be greater than the
amounts it would have paid for those items had this provision not been in
effect.
   (c)   The pick-up shall be included in the employee's total annual salary
for the purpose of computing daily rate of pay, for determining paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence, or for any similar purpose.

PFDPF shall be mandatory for all of the employees previously described who are
members of the PERS or PFDPF. No such member shall have the option of choosing
to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the
City to PERS or PFDPF.
   (e)   The City shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
Federal, State and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of

while applicable municipal income tax laws require it to report as an
employee's gross income his total annual salary including the amount of the
pick-up.
   (f)   The Mayor, or his designee, is hereby directed to take all acts
necessary and appropriate to initiate implementation of the provisions of this
resolution, including but not limited to making applications to the Internal
Revenue Service and the Board administering the PERS or PFDPF programs to
determine the requirements of the boards in connection with such pick-up plan.
   (g)   The pick-up plan shall apply to all eligible employees who qualify
under this section and the plan shall commence with the first pay period
following the passage and approval of this section.

return upon such forms and setting forth such information as the Finance

series of performances or exhibitions, or at such other times as the Finance
Director shall determine.

report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this
chapter.

shall furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner,
lessee or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be
conducted, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Finance
Director of the issuance of such certificate and the joint liability for
collection and remittance of such tax.

DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX

   In the taxation of income which is subject to the City income tax, if the
books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within
and without the boundaries of the City shall disclose with reasonable accuracy
what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or
profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then only that portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for the purposes of
Municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the City, in the absence of
actual records thereof, shall be determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
   (a)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the City during
the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
during the same period, wherever situated;
   As used in subsection (a) hereof, "real property" includes property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
   (b)    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
City to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period to
persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed;
   (c)    Gross receipts of the business or profession, from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the above allocation formula does not produce an equitable
result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to
produce such result.
(Ord. 66-67. Passed 12-19-66.)
173.0702 SALES MADE IN THE CITY DEFINED.
   As used in subsection (c) of Section
173.0701 "sales made in the City" means:

goods within the City;
   (b)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
City regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the City if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion;
   (c)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place

(b) and (c) of Section
173.0701 or such of the percentages as are applicable to the particular

outside the City.

173.0704 RENTALS.
   (a)    Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under subsections (c)
through (e) of Section
173.0501, only if and to the extent that the rental ownership, management or
operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   (b)    Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
the taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax; provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
per month; and provided further that a person who operates a licensed rooming
house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds

following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating

174.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   The income tax levied by the City at a rate of two percent (2.00%) per annum
is levied on the Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or
earning and/or receiving income in the City, until December 31, 2029, on which
date the tax rate shall revert back to one and three-quarters percent (1.75%)
per annum,
Individuals.
   (A)    For residents of the City, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
174.02(C)(16)).
   (B)    For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)    For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to “Municipal
Taxable Income” as defined in Section
174.02 (C)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section
174.02 (C)(12).
Refundable credit for Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
   (D)    (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    “Qualifying loss” means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    “Refundable credit” means the amount of Municipal income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the City, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Domicile.
   (E)    (1)    (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the City
for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the City
on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in the City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be considered
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
         (b)    The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         (c)    The address on the individual's driver's license;
         (d)    The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
         (e)    The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
         (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         (g)    The primary location at which the individual is employed.
         (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the City.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact period" with
the City if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of the City and while away overnight from that abode spends at
least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the
City.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
City or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745 of
the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
174.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)    (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1)
of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
174.12(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
174.12(A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For
the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the City if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from
a stock of goods located within the City.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within the City to
purchasers outside the City, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)    (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City’s income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section 4 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location. After the taxpayer
makes the initial election, the election applies to every municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer shall not be required to
file a net profit return with a municipal corporation solely because a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located in such municipal corporation. Nothing in this division prohibits a
taxpayer from making a new election under this division after properly revoking
a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
174.04  this Chapter.
         (Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
 
174.04  COLLECTION AT SOURCE. 
Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
174.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
174.01 of this Chapter, of two percent (2.00%) per annum until December 31,
2021, on which date the tax rate shall revert back to one and three quarters
percent (1.75%). An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)    (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred
compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred
compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

         (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of
an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal
allocation among such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the
time spent or sales made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A
municipal corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this
division shall be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to
those qualifying wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
         (d)    "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs services
in a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.

event basis.
         (f)    "Public figure" means a person of prominence who performs
services at discrete events, such as speeches, public appearances, or similar
events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than twenty (20) days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does
not include the home of an employee.
      (2)    (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the City
if the employee performed such services in the City on twenty (20) or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
City.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20)
days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer
to last more than twenty (20) days" if either of the following applies at the
time the services commence:
               [a]   The nature of the services is such that it will require
more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the services;
               [b]    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty (20) days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the City and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
174.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that

processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)    (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the twenty (20) day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in
that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City
for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)    If an employer’s fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
174.02, the employer shall withhold City income tax on all of the employee's
qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the City,
regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
174.04.
         (Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
174.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,

property of that individual
   
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)    (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the City . No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the
end of the taxpayer’s taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the City. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City’s income tax
return. The extended due date of the City’s income tax return shall be the
fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth (10th) month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after
January 1, 2023, the extended due date of City’s income tax return for a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month
after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An
extension of time to file under this division is not an extension of the time
to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that
date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City’s income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer’s Municipal income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return
is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City’s income tax return. The extended due date of the City’s income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)    (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
174.04(C)(1)(g)) within the City.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
 174.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and any of the City’s ordinances, resolutions, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to City income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file a City income
tax return, estimated City income tax return, or extension for filing a City
income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of City income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty(180) days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth (180th) day
after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide
such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   
   (O)    (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first (181st) day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred eighty-first
(181st) day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)    (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)    (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation
in accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated City income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)    (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City’s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for
each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five (5) year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
174.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
 174.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
174.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 174.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
174.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
174.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(C) of this section, the credit shall not exceed seventy five percent (75%) of
the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other municipality by
the LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality OR the tax rate of one and
one quarter percent (1.25%).
   (B)    The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, “the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City’s income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)    (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
174.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)    (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5%) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45%) percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth (9th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5)
percent of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month of
the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with Section
174.05.
   (D)    (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
174.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
174.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first (1st) day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first (1st) day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
174.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (C)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
174.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
174.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three (3) year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by City. If the City’s
tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund of the
tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow a
nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City’s tax rate. However, if the City’s tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.
(Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)    If a taxpayer’s tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)    (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
174.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)    (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
174.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City income tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City income tax return showing income
subject to City income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax
shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax
or overpayment is less than ten ($10.00) dollars.
(Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)    (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover City income taxes and penalties
and interest on City income taxes shall be brought within the later of:
Ordinance
            (i)    Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One (1) year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
174.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination of the
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section 174.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
174.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
174.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 23-76. Passed 12-4-23.)
174.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 23-76.
Passed 12-4-23.)
174.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)    (1)    (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an
undeliverable address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to
ascertain a new last known address, including the use of a change of address
service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under
Section 5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a
new last known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and
considered served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days
after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty (60) days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete,
and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by
ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)    (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty (20%) percent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal

Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and

for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them or while the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in
subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to
   any administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person
was under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon
the request of the court, the services provider shall submit the results of the
assessment to the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical
diagnoses related to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in

4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

and the name, color, and serial number or other identifying marks of the
bicycle and other information as the Chief deems pertinent.
   (b)   The Chief of Police shall not issue a registration for any bicycle
when he knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is not

the information stated thereon is true.
   (c)   No person who is the owner of a bicycle shall be permitted to use such
bicycle unless it is registered in a manner satisfactory to the Chief.
   (d)   A registration fee of one dollar ($1.00) shall be paid to the Chief
for each registration granted. The registration provided for in this section
shall be valid for a period of seven years from the date of issuance, or until
ownership of such registered bicycle changes, whichever occurs first. This
provision shall not apply to any bicycle in transit within the City provided
that such bicycles have been registered in some other municipality in
accordance with the terms of an ordinance similar to the foregoing if such
exists, or if the owner is a resident of another community. If a private
business issues registration, then a fifty cent (50¢) fee shall be retained by
the issuer for his cost.

375.02 DISPOSITION OF FEES.
   The Chief of Police shall pay monthly to the Director of Finance all fees
received pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and shall take the Director
of Finance’s receipt therefor, which shall be kept as a part of the Police
Department’s record of such registrations.
(Ord. 73-68. Passed 7-16-73.)
375.03 REGISTRATION PLATE OR DECAL.
   (a)   The Chief of Police shall issue a registration plate or decal together
with a certificate bearing the name and address of the owner, the make and
manufacturer’s serial number, type or model and the date issued. The owner

bicycle for which issued, in such position as to be plainly visible. No person
shall destroy or remove a registration plate or decal from a bicycle.
   (b)   On bicycles not containing a manufacturer’s serial number the Chief
shall establish a serial number system and cause such number to be permanently

the pregnant woman, with the consent of the pregnant woman implied by law in a
medical emergency, or with the approval of one otherwise authorized by law to
consent to medical treatment on behalf of the pregnant woman. An abortion that
violates the conditions described in the immediately preceding sentence may be
punished as a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.01, 2903.02, 2903.03, 2903.04,
2903.05, 2903.06, 2903.08, 2903.11, 2903.12, 2903.13, 2903.14, 2903.21, or
2903.22, as applicable. An abortion that does not violate the conditions
described in the second immediately preceding sentence, but that does violate
Ohio R.C. 2919.12, division (B) of Ohio R.C. 2919.13, or Ohio R.C. 2919.151,
2919.17 or 2919.18, may be punished as a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.12,
division (B) of Ohio R.C. 2919.13, or Ohio R.C. 2919.151, 2919.17 or 2919.18,
as applicable. Consent is sufficient under this subsection if it is of the type
otherwise adequate to permit medical treatment to the pregnant woman, even if
it does not comply with Ohio R.C. 2919.12.
         B.   In a manner so that the offense is applied or is construed as
applying to a woman based on an act or omission of the woman that occurs while
she is or was pregnant and that results in any of the following:

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 DEPOSIT FOR WARRANT OF ARREST.
   (a)   Any person other than police officers of the City desiring to make
complaint by affidavit, to prosecute another for the violation of any City
ordinance or State statute shall be required to deposit ten dollars ($10.00)
with the Clerk of Court before a warrant of arrest shall be issued. However,
whenever the Prosecutor, in his discretion, is satisfied that the public peace
and welfare requires immediate prosecution, or that the complainant is acting
in good faith and unable to post such deposit, he may waive the provisions of
this section.
   (b)   A complainant or prosecuting witness who has posted a deposit as
required in this section and during the pendency of such proceeding does appear
as a witness against the accused, and otherwise cooperates in such prosecution,
shall be entitled to a refund of the deposit made.
(Ord. 74-36. Passed 5-6-74.)

commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.

offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
(b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11 , either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
   (d)   In addition to any other penalty prescribed by law, the Court shall
impose a term of mandatory actual imprisonment of thirty consecutive days if
the offender has previously been convicted of a drug abuse offense. The thirty
day term of mandatory actual imprisonment shall be served prior to any other
term of imprisonment imposed by the Court.
(Ord. 89-14. Passed 12-4-89.)
   (e)   Mandatory Fines; License Suspension; Notification Regarding
Professionally Licensed Person for Drug Abuse Offenses.
      (1)   In addition to the penalty prescribed by subsection (c) hereof and

fifty dollars ($750.00) if the violation of Chapter
513 was a misdemeanor of the second degree, a mandatory fine of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) if the violation of Chapter

fifty dollars ($250.00) if the violation of Chapter
513 was a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, and a mandatory fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) if the violation of Chapter

      (2)   No Court shall impose a mandatory fine pursuant to subsection (d)
(1) hereof upon an offender who alleges in an affidavit filed with the Court
prior to his sentencing that he is indigent and is unable to pay any mandatory
fine imposed pursuant to subsection (d)(1) hereof, if the Court determines the
offender is an indigent person and is unable to pay the fine.
      (3)   In addition to any other penalty imposed for a violation of Chapter
513, the Court may suspend for up to five years the driver’s or commercial
driver’s license, of any person who is convicted of or has pleaded guilty to a

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing

for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

the property line of the property on which the noise source is located, and
shall be made at least ten feet from any large reflecting surfaces.
   (d)   For any source of sound which emits a pure tone, cyclically varying
sound or repetitive impulsive sound, the limits set forth in Table 3 shall be
reduced by five dBA.
   (e)   Any noise which occurs on property which is being used in a legally
nonconforming manner, and which noise relates to such use, shall be judged as
if the property bore a zoning designation under which the use would be
conforming.
   (f)   If the zoning designation of the property on which the source of the
noise is located differs from the zoning designation of the property on which
the noise is measured, the maximum permissible noise level of the more
restrictive zoning designation shall apply.
   (g)   Noises such as those of an irregular and intermittent nature shall be
restricted as provided herein.
   (h)   The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following:

dwelling, building, structure or premises within the City as may be necessary
to enforce the provisions of this chapter, provided permission is obtained from
the occupant or, in the case of unoccupied property, from the owner or his
agent. If such permission is refused, or is otherwise unobtainable, a search
warrant shall be obtained upon the showing of probable cause to believe that a
violation of this chapter may exist, before such entry or inspection is made.
   (b)   At the request of the operator of a passenger vehicle, the officer can
administer a stationary motor vehicle noise test. If the officer cannot
administer the test at the time of the request, he shall notify the operator
when and where the operator may have his vehicle tested. The stationary motor
vehicle noise test can provide information as to the extent of defectiveness of
the exhaust system or as to whether excessive noise levels were caused by
improper operation of the vehicle. (Ord. 82-17. Passed 6-28-82.)
557.06 SPECIAL VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Police Chief, or his designated representative, shall have the
authority, consistent with this section, to grant special variances.
   (b)   Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this section shall
file an application with the Police Chief, or his designated representative.
The application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the
source of sound or activity for which the special variance is sought into
compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the
applicant, on the community or on other persons. Notice of an application for a
special variance shall be given by the Police Chief or his representative to
persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity and who may be adversely
affected by the granting of the variance. Any individual who claims to be
adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement
with the Police Chief or his representative containing any information to
support his claim.
   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Police
Chief or his designated representative shall balance the hardship of the
applicant, the community and other persons of not granting the special variance
against the adverse impact of the health, safety and welfare of persons
affected, the adverse impact on property affected and any other adverse impact
of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances and persons
contesting special variances may be required to submit any information the
Police Chief or his representative may reasonably require. In granting or
denying an application, the Police Chief or his representative shall place on
public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the
special variance.
   (d)   Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions
are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any conditions of the
special variances shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those
provisions of this chapter regulating the source of sound or activity for which
the special variance was granted.
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in special
variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated
like applications for special variances.
   (f)   The Police Chief or his designated representative may issue guidelines

and dances, or any ordinance regulating, controlling or in any way relating to
health, sanitation, fire protection or the public peace, or for the violation

assessed written notice of the assessment. The notice may be served upon the
vendor assessed personally or by registered or certified mail.

collected is, or should be, greater than the amount indicated remitted by the
vendor, the Director of Finance may upon the basis of test checks of a vendor’s
business for a representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the
ratio which the tax requires to be collected under this chapter bears to the
hotel’s lodgings which determination shall be the basis of an assessment as
herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall be made in the
manner prescribed in this chapter.

providing for the remission of penalties added to assessments made under this
chapter.

753.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)    Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
adult entertainment businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult entertainment businesses on the community presented in findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters. Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v.
Glen Theater. Inc. 501 U.S. 560 (1991), Ellwest Stereo Theater. Inc. v. Boner,
718 F. Supp. 1553 (M.D. Tenn. 1989), and Broadway Books. Inc. v. Roberts 642 F.
Supp. 486 (E.D. Tenn. 1986); and on studies in other cities, including New
York, New York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis,
Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; along with
Manatee County Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of
Minnesota; this Council finds:
      (1)    Adult entertainment businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently inadequately controlled by
the operators of such establishments. Further, there is presently no adequate
mechanism to make owners of such establishments within Fairview Park
responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
      (2)    Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur
at adult entertainment businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi- private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos or live sexually-
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea and human immondeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)    Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)    Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)    Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of adult entertainment businesses where persons view sexually
oriented films.
      (6)    The findings noted in paragraph (b)(1) through (5) hereof, raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)    Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)    A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
adult entertainment businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place
a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that adult entertainment
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the City. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the adult entertainment business and fully in possession and
control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)    The regulations of nudity in adult entertainment businesses will
further the substantial government interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex related crimes, including illegal public sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety and welfare.
      (10)    Removal of doors on viewing booths in adult entertainment
businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and
unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will
facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal,
State and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest
in protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (11)    Requiring sufficient lighting in all adult entertainment
businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing
illegal sexual activity on the premises of adult entertainment businesses and
will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other
Federal, State and local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental
interest in protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (12)    The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of adult entertainment
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other Federal, State and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (13)    A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in an adult
entertainment business or adult motel. Barring such individuals from the
management of and employment in adult entertainment businesses for a period of
years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related
criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually
transmitted diseases.

      (1)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National categorical
pretreatment standards as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all Dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories. An application for modification of the
national categorical pretreatment standards may be considered by submittal to
the USEPA Regional Administrator by the Control Authority, when the Rocky River
wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as
defined by 40 CFR, 403.7.
      (2)   State Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with the State of
Ohio Pretreatment Rules codified at Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 3745-3.
         (Ord. 12-38. Passed 11-19-12.)
      (3)   Local Limits. The Superintendent is authorized to establish Local
Limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). The following pollutant limits are
established to protect against Pass Through and Interference. No person shall
discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following concentrations. The
following list is not intended to be a complete list of toxic pollutants. The
average concentration of toxic substances into the sewage system over the
course of any 24-hour period from any one establishment shall be the magnitude
of the stated concentrations with peak and/or instantaneous concentrations not
greater than twice this amount (unless otherwise stated). However, where low
downstream dilution might be expected, the requirements may be modified at the
discretion of the Control Authority.
SUBSTANCE             CONCENTRATION
Arsenic               0.50    mg/L
Cadmium               0.10   mg/L
Chromium (Hexavalent) 0.37    mg/L
Copper                0.74   mg/L
Cyanide               0.10    mg/L
Lead                  0.50    mg/L
Mercury               BMP's mg/L
Nickel                0.55    mg/L
Selenium              1.41    mg/L
(Ord. 24-79. Passed 12-16-24.)
These limits may be modified as necessary to comply with State and Federal
toxic waste discharge standards. The Control Authority may develop Best
Management Practices (BMP's) in individual wastewater discharge permits, to
implement Local Limits and the requirements of Section
915.03 .
      (4)   Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to amend this
chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges
to the Rocky River WWTP where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives
set forth in Section
915.01 (c).
      (5)   Dilution. No Discharger shall increase the use of potable or
process water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of
diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
      (6)   Calculation of Equivalent Mass and Concentration Limits for
Categorical Standards.  When the limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard
are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
City may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as a
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial
Dischargers following the methodology contained in 40 CFR 403.6(c)(3) and (c)
(4). Industrial Dischargers will be required to comply with the equivalent
limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived.
   (d)    Accidental Discharge/ Slug Discharge Control Plans. The POTW shall
evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control
plan or other action to control Slug Discharges. The POTW may require any User
to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control Slug Discharges. Alternatively, the
POTW may develop such a plan for any User. An accidental discharge/slug
discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or
Slug Discharge, as required below; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or Slug
Discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   Each Discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter.
Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the Discharger's cost and
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the Control Authority for review, and
shall be approved by the Control Authority before construction of the facility.
No Discharger who discharges to the Rocky River WWTP shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until Slug Discharge Control Plans have
been approved by the Control Authority. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures by the Control Authority shall not relieve the Discharger
from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   Dischargers shall notify the Control Authority immediately upon the
occurrence of a "slugload", or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by
this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and
time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions.
Any Discharger who discharges a slugload of prohibitive materials shall be
liable for any expense, loss or damage to the Rocky River WWTP, in addition to
the amount of any fines imposed on the City and/or Control Authority on account
thereof under State or Federal law.
        Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on Discharger's
premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure.
   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the Control Authority
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a Slug
Discharge.
        (e)    No person shall access the sewer system or Rocky River WWTP for
any activity including discharge of hauled septic or industrial wastes except
at locations and at times as designated by the Control Authority which also may
prohibit the disposal of such hauled wastes. The discharge of hauled wastes is
subject to all other requirements of this Chapter. Any removal of manhole lids,
or other access to the sewer system for the purpose of discharging wastes at
times and/or locations other than those designated by the Control Authority, or
without the expressed permission of the Control Authority shall be considered a
violation and shall be subject to enforcement action including fines and
penalties allowed under this Chapter.

furnished by the Discharger and may require additional information. Within
thirty (30) days after full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished,
the Control Authority shall notify the Discharger of the Control Authority's
acceptance thereof.
      (3)   Standards Modification. The City reserves the right to amend this
chapter and the terms and conditions hereof in order to assure compliance by
the City and Control Authority with applicable laws and regulations. Within
nine (9) months of the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard, this chapter shall be amended to require compliance by Dischargers
with such standards within the time frame prescribed by such standards. Where a
Discharger, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not
previously submitted a disclosure form as required by Section
915.05 (b)(2), the Discharger shall file a disclosure form with the Control
Authority within one hundred eighty (180) days after the promulgation of the
Applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. EPA. In
addition, any Discharger operating on the basis of a previous filing of a
disclosure statement, shall submit to the Control Authority within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the promulgation of an applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, the additional information required by paragraphs H. and
I. of Section
915.05 (b)(2). The Discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in the
chapter at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change. Any
changes or new conditions in the chapter shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.
   (c)    Reporting Requirements for Discharger.
                (1)   Compliance Date Report. Within ninety (90) days following
the date for final compliance by the Discharger with applicable Pretreatment
Standards set forth in this chapter or ninety (90) days following commencement
of the introduction of wastewater into the Rocky River WWTP by a new
Discharger, any Discharger subject to this chapter shall submit to the Control
Authority a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or
regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum
daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional OM&R and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
Discharger into compliance with the applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. This statement shall be signed as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of
this Section, and by a qualified engineer (licensed to practice in the State of
Ohio). In addition to the above required information, for Industrial
Dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of such Discharger's long term production
rate. For all other Industrial Dischargers subject to categorical Pretreatment
Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
Discharger's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
           (2)    Periodic Compliance Reports.
         A.   Any Discharger subject to Individual Wastewater Discharge
Permits, after the effective date of such Permits, shall submit to the Control
Authority according to the schedule included in the Permits, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances
in the effluent which are limited by the
Pretreatment Standards as set forth in the Permits. In cases where the
Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP)
or pollution prevention alternative, the Discharger must submit documentation
required by the Control Authority or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the User.
In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported in Section
915.05 (c)(1), hereof. Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual
measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations
justify, the Control Authority may accept reports of average and maximum flow
estimated by verifiable techniques. The Control Authority, for good cause shown
considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize the submission of said
reports on months other than those specified above. This report shall be signed
as provided in paragraph (c) (4) of this Section.
         B.   Reports of Dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the Control Authority. The frequency
of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed by the Pretreatment
Coordinator and set forth in the Individual Wastewater Discharge Permits. All
sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136
and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standard. (Comment: Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of
the U.S. EPA.)
         C.   If sampling performed by an Industrial Discharger indicates a
violation, the Discharger shall notify the Control Authority within twenty-four
(24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The Discharger shall also repeat
the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Control Authority within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation, except the Industrial Discharger is not required to resample if:
            1.   The Control Authority performs sampling at the Industrial
Discharger at a frequency of at least once per month, or
            2.   The Control Authority performs sampling at the Discharger
between the time when the Discharger performs its initial sampling and the time
when the Discharger receives the results of this sampling.
         D.   Sampling. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
            1.   Except as indicated in subsections 2 and 3 below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Control Authority. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority, the
samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Control Authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits.
            2.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
            3.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
90-day compliance reports required in subsections (b) and (c)(1) [40 CFR 403.12
(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for
facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for
which historical sampling data are available, the Control Authority may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraph (c)(2) (40 CFR
403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required to collect the number
of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable
Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
         E.   Monitoring Waiver. The Control Authority may authorize the
Industrial User subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego
sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the
Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors
that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and
without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User.
This Monitoring Waiver authorization is subject to the conditions in 40 CFR
403.12(e) (2) thru (e) (3) (iv).
      (3)   Notification of changed discharge. All Industrial Dischargers shall
promptly notify the Control Authority in advance of any substantial change in
the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed
or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
           (4)    Signatory requirements for Industrial Discharge Reports. The
reports required by paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this Section shall
include the following certified statement:
   "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations."
         In addition, said reports shall be signed as follows:
         A.   By a responsible corporate officer, if the Industrial Discharger
submitting the reports required by paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(1), and (c)(2), of
this Section is a corporation. For the purpose of this paragraph, a responsible
corporate officer means:
            1.   A president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the
corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who

responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for
the company; and
            3.   The written authorization is submitted to the Control
Authority.
         D.   If an authorization under paragraph (c)(4)C. of this section is
no longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company a new authorization
satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)C. of this section must be
submitted to the Control Authority prior to or together with any reports to be
signed by an authorized representative.
   (d)   General Control Mechanisms.
      (1)   At the discretion of the Control Authority, the Control Authority
may use general control mechanisms to control SIU discharges to the POTW if the
following conditions are met. All facilities to be covered by a general control
mechanism must:
         A.   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
         B.    Discharge the same types of wastes;
         C.   Require the same effluent limitations;
         D.   Require the same or similar monitoring; and
         E.   In the opinion of the Control Authority, are more appropriately
controlled under a general control mechanism than under individual wastewater
discharge permits.
      (2)   To be covered by the general control mechanism, the SIU must file a
written request for coverage that identifies its contact information,
production processes, the types of wastes generated, the location for
monitoring all wastes covered by the general control mechanism, any requests in
accordance with Section
915.05  (c) (2) for a Monitoring Waiver for a pollutant neither present nor
expected to be present in the Discharge, and any other information the POTW
deems appropriate. A Monitoring Waiver for a pollutant neither present nor
expected to be present in the discharge is not effective in the general control
mechanism until after the Control Authority has provided written notice to the
SIU that such a waiver request has been granted in accordance with Section
915.05  (c) (2).
      (3)   The Control Authority will retain a copy of the general control
mechanism, documentation to support the POTW's determination that a specific
SIU meets the criteria in subsection (d) (1) above and applicable State
regulations, and a copy of the SIU's written request for coverage for three (3)
years after the expiration of the general control mechanism.
      (4)   The Control Authority may not control an SIU through a general
control mechanism where the facility is subject to production-based categorical
Pretreatment Standards or categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed as mass
of pollutant discharged per day or for IUs whose limits are based on the
Combined Wastestream Formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)) or Net/Gross calculations (40
CFR 403.15).
   (e)   Monitoring Facilities. Each Discharger shall provide and operate at
the Discharger's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the Control
Authority. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the Discharger's
premises, except where such location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship on the Discharger, the City may concur with the facility being
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area providing that the facility
is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expense of the Discharger.
        All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of receipt
of permit by Discharger.
        (f)    Inspection and Sampling. The Control Authority may inspect the
monitoring facilities of any Discharger to determine compliance with the
requirements of this chapter. The Discharger shall allow the Control Authority
or its representatives, upon presentation of credentials of identification, to
enter upon the premises of the Discharger at all reasonable hours, for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, or records examination. The Control Authority
shall have the right to set up on the Discharger's property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations.
        (g)    Confidential Information. Information and data on a User
obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications,
individual wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs, and from the
Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable Ohio law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and
shall be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 12-38. Passed 11-
19-12.)
915.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Orders. The Control Authority shall issue orders to any
industrial discharger to comply with any portion of this chapter, including
categorical pretreatment standards, locally developed industrial discharge
limits, other discharge limits and reporting requirements.
   (b)   Enforcement Response Plan.
      (1)   The Control Authority shall develop and implement an Enforcement
Response Plan. This Plan shall contain detailed procedures indicating how the
Control Authority will investigate and respond to instances of Industrial User
non-compliance. The Plan shall include:
         A.   Description of how the Control Authority will investigate
instances of non-compliance.
         B.   Description of the types of escalating enforcement responses the
Control Authority will take in response to all anticipated types of Industrial
User violations and the time periods within which response will take place;
         C.   Identify by title the official(s) responsible for each type of
response;
         D.   Adequately reflect the Authority's primary responsibility to
enforce all applicable pretreatment requirements and standards, as detailed in
40 CFR 403.8(f)(1) and (f)(2).
   (c)   Enforcement Remedies:
      (1)   Emergency Suspension of Service and Discharge Permits (ESS). The
Control Authority may for good cause shown suspend the wastewater treatment
service to a Discharger when it appears to the Control Authority that an actual
or threatened discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger
to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment,
interfere with the operation of the Rocky River WWTP, or violate any
pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any Discharger notified of the
suspension of wastewater treatment service shall within a reasonable period of
time, as determined by the Control Authority, cease all discharges. In the
event of failure of the Discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order within the specified time, the City shall commence judicial proceedings
immediately thereafter to compel the Discharger's compliance with such order.
The Control Authority shall reinstate the wastewater treatment service and
terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the Discharger of the
elimination of the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the threat of
imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.
           (2)    Revocation of Treatment Services (RTS): The Control Authority
may seek to terminate the wastewater treatment services to any Discharger which
fails to:
         A.   Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics
of its discharge;
         B.   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
         C.   Refuses reasonable access to the Discharger's premises by
representatives of the Control Authority for the purpose of inspection or
monitoring; or
         D.   Violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.
           (3)    Notification of Violation - Administrative Adjustment (NOV):
Whenever the Control Authority finds that any Discharger has engaged in conduct
which justifies termination of wastewater treatment services, pursuant to
Section
915.06 (b) hereof, the Control Authority shall serve or cause to be served upon
such Discharger, a written notice either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged
violation. Within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of this notice, the
Discharger shall respond personally or in writing to the Control Authority,
advising of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the
parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where
necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
      (4)   Show Cause Hearing (SCH): Where the violation of Section
915.06 (b) hereof is not corrected by timely compliance by means of
Administrative Adjustment, the Control Authority may order any Discharger which
causes or allows conduct prohibited by Section
915.06 (b) hereof, to show cause before the Control Authority or its duly
authorized representative, why the proposed service termination action should
not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the Discharger by personal
service, certified or registered, return receipt requested, specifying the time
and place of a hearing to be held by the Control Authority or its designee
regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken,
the proposed enforcement action, and directing the Discharger to show cause
before the Control Authority or its designee why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less
than ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent,
officer, or authorized representative of a Discharger. The proceedings at the
hearing shall be considered by the Control Authority which shall then enter
appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the
Discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the Discharger in accordance
with applicable local or State law.
      (5)    Judicial Proceedings (JP): Following the entry of any order by the
Control Authority with respect to the conduct of a Discharger contrary to the
provisions of Section
915.06 (b) hereof, the Attorney for the City and/or Control Authority may,
following the authorization of such action by the City, commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local Court.
      (6)   Enforcement Actions - Annual Publication (AP): At least annually in
a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice
within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list shall be published of all
industrial users which at any time during the previous twelve (12) months were
in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. For the
purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance
if its violations meet one or more of the following criteria:
         A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here
as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all of the measurements
taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum
limit or the average limit, including Instantaneous Limits, for the same
pollutant parameter;
         B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of all the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit, including Instantaneous
Limits, multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
         C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer term average or Instantaneous Limits) that the Pretreatment
Coordinator determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
dischargers, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of
Rocky River WWTP personnel or the general public);
         D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in
the Rocky River WWTP's exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such
a discharge;
         E.   Failure to meet, within 90 days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit,
control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
         F.   Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, 90 day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules or any other reports required by the control authority;
              G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and
         H.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of Best Management Practices, which the Pretreatment Coordinator
determines will or has adversely affected the operation or implementation of
the City's and/or Control Authority's pretreatment program.
   (d)    Right of Appeal. Any Discharger or any interested party shall have
the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the Control
Authority on any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a
prompt written reply. In the event that such inquiry is by a Discharger and
deals with matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which
enforcement activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt
of a Discharger's request, shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending
receipt of the aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order
entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with local and
State law.
   (e)   Operating Upsets. Any Discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the Discharger in a temporary state of non-compliance
with this chapter shall inform the Control Authority thereof within twenty-four
(24) hours of first awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such
information is given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed
by the Discharger with the Control Authority within five (5) days. The report
shall address:
           (1)    Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's
impact on a Discharger's compliance status.
           (2)    Duration of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
of non-compliance, and if the non-compliance continues, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to occur.
           (3)    All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of non-compliance.
   A document and verified bona fide operation upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the City and/or Control Authority
against a Discharger for any non-compliance with the chapter which arises out
of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset. (Ord.
12-38. Passed 11-19-12.)
915.07 PENALTIES.
   (a)    Penalties.
      (1)   Whenever any discharger who may have violated and/or who has
neglected or failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, and the

or impairs the City's and/or Control Authority's Wastewater Treatment Plant
wastewater disposal system shall be liable to the City and/or Control Authority
for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The
City and/or Control Authority shall bill the Discharger for the costs incurred
by the City for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the
violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a
violation of this Ordinance enforceable under the provisions of Section
915.06 .
        (c)    Falsifying Information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this

activities brought by the City and/or Control Authority pursuant hereto shall
be retained and preserved by the Discharger until all enforcement activities
have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all
appeals have expired. (Ord. 12-38. Passed 11-19-12.)
915.09 MISCELLANEOUS.
        (a)    Removal Credits. Where applicable, the Control Authority may
elect to initiate a program of removal credits as part of this chapter to
reflect the Rocky River WWTP's ability to remove pollutants in accordance with
40 CFR Part 403.7.
       (b)    Net/Gross Calculations. The Control Authority may elect to adjust
Categorical Pretreatment Standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the
Discharger's intake water, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.15. (Ord. 12-38.
Passed 11-19-12.)
915.10 SEPARABILITY.
        If any provision, paragraph, or section of this chapter is invalidated
by any Court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs,
words, and sections shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and
effect.
(Ord. 12-38. Passed 11-19-12.)
915.11 CONFLICT.
        All other ordinances and parts of other ordinances inconsistent or
conflicting with any part of this chapter shall supersede the extent of such
inconsistency or conflict.
(Ord. 12-38. Passed 11-19-12.)
915.12 BYPASS.
   (a)    Bypass not violating applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. An Industrial Discharger may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
        (b)    Notice.  
                    (1)    If an Industrial Discharger knows in advance of the
need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Control Authority, if
possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass.
                   (2)    An Industrial Discharger shall submit oral notice of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the
Control Authority within 24 hours from the time the Industrial Discharger
becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the Industrial Discharger becomes aware of the bypass.
The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause;
the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass
has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the
bypass. The Control Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case
basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
   (c)    Prohibition of Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City and/or Control Authority may
take enforcement action against an Industrial Discharger for a bypass, unless:
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage; there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventative maintenance; and
         B.   The Industrial Discharger submitted notices as required under
paragraph (b) of this section.
      (2)   The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it
will meet the conditions listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this Section.

sewers, water supply and other public utilities, and developments for
recreation, schools and other facilities;

   Whenever the abbreviated terms, R1F-75, GB-A, etc. are used in this Zoning
Code, they shall be construed as referring to their corresponding district
titles. The Office Building District is divided into three Height Districts
known as Office Building - "1", Office Building - “2" and Office Building -

Districts shall be applicable to the three Height Districts other than those
schedules and zoning regulations applicable to a specific Height District only.
(Ord. 98-34A. Passed 11-16-98.)
1109.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULATIONS.
   Any building and any tract of land may be used, and the use of any building
and any tract of land may be changed or extended, and any existing building may
be altered, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved or maintained, for any
use permitted or required by the regulations for the district in which the
building or tract of land is located, and for no other use.
   Such use, change, extension, alteration, conversion, enlargement,
reconstruction, relocation or maintenance shall be subject to all area, yard,
height and all other regulations set forth or referred to for the district in
which the building or tract of land is located and to all other applicable
regulations of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 67-17. Passed 5-15-67.)
1109.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONE MAP.
   The aforesaid districts are designated by symbols and the locations and
boundaries of such districts are established on a map entitled, "Zone Map of
the City of Fairview Park, Ohio", dated March 6, 1995. All notations, schedules
and other information shown thereon and all amendments thereto are hereby made
a part of this Zoning Code, and it may be amended in the same manner as any
other part of this Zoning Code or in the manner provided by the Charter of the
City of Fairview Park.
(Ord. 94-96. Passed 3-6-95.)
1109.04 DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   The district boundary lines of the Zone Map enclose an area of a designated
district and generally follow the center lines of streets or alleys, lot lines
or their extensions. However, where a boundary line is shown by dimension or
relationship as being located a specific distance from and parallel to a street
line, this distance shall control. Where a boundary line does not coincide with
any of the aforesaid lines, and where it is not located by dimensions shown on
the map, it shall be determined by use of the scale appearing thereon. In cases
of uncertainty, the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall determine the
exact location.
(Ord. 67-17. Passed 5-15-67.)
1109.05 ZONING LOT DIVIDED BY DISTRICT BOUNDARY.
   Where any lot is partly in one district and partly in another district with
different regulations, the part of such zoning lot within each district shall
conform to the regulations of that district, with the exception that the area
of the entire zoning lot may be used to compute the unit area requirements set
forth in this Zoning Code. In the event that the area, or any part thereof, of
the entire zoning lot is used to compute the unit area requirements set forth
in this Zoning Code, then the entire area of such zoning lot shall be
landscaped and maintained as such, as required by the Planning and Design
Commission.

   (c)    Where there is a sharing of parking facilities as permitted by
subsection (b) hereof, there shall be a written agreement covering such
indefinite period of time as may be required by the Planning and Design
Commission whereby the owner of the land on which the facilities are to be
located shall be bound by a long term lease or by a covenant filed and recorded
in the Office of the County Recorder requiring such owner, his heirs,
successors or assigns to make such parking facilities available to such use.
      (Ord. 93-2. Passed 4-5-93.)

(Ord. 93-2. Passed 4-5-93.)
1113.08 ACCESSWAYS TO PARKING AREAS.
   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking facilities
shall be planned to interfere as little as possible with the use of nearby
property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on adjacent streets.
Whenever possible, the center line of the access driveways on the frontage
street shall be at least forty feet from the right-of-way lane of the nearest
intersecting street and spaces at not less than 120 feet intervals, measured
from the center line of the driveways.
   Parking areas shall be designated so that vehicles can be driven forward
into the street. Those of fifteen spaces or less shall have at least one
single-lane driveway with a maximum of two single-lane or one two-lane
driveway. Those of sixteen spaces or more shall have at least two single-lane
or one two-lane driveway. Each accessway to a parking area of sixteen spaces or
more shall be limited to two lanes.
   The width of driveways, measured at the setback line, shall conform to the
following schedule. At no point where adjoining a public sidewalk shall the
maximum widths be exceeded.
 
Lanes Minimum (feet) Maximum (feet)
1     10             12
2     18             24
 
   The angle of intersection between the driveway and the street shall be
between sixty degrees and ninety degrees. The radius at the edge from the apron
shall be at least twelve feet, twenty feet recommended, so that a motor vehicle
entering or leaving may not obstruct vehicles in other traffic lanes in the
driveway or in the curb lane of the street.
(Ord. 84-93. Passed 6-17-85.)
1113.09 SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS; PARKING.
   (a)    Proposed and existing parking areas and access driveways shall be
improved with asphalt concrete or portland cement concrete or other impervious
surface and shall be so graded and drained into proper inlets so that all water
is drained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway is located in
such manner that water shall not drain across other public or private property.
   (b)    Parking areas shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with the design
standards in this chapter, and shall be improved, except at entrances and exits
with guard rails, curbs or other devices to define parking spaces or limits of
paved areas, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles into adjacent areas of
public ways, yards or setbacks required by the Zoning Code, and so as to
regulate the flow of traffic within the lot.
(Ord. 84-93. Passed 6-17-85.)
   (c)   The Planning and Design Commission may require landscape buffering or
landscape screening to be provided on the parking area property to insulate the
parking areas and driveways from a side or rear lot line of other property in
Residential Districts or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited to,
evergreen trees and bushes, compact hedges, shrubs, earth berms or a
combination thereof. Landscape screening shall include plant material or other
nonliving durable material, including, but not limited to, walls, berms or
substantially solid decorative wood fencing. Where trees and shrubs are used to
provide a landscape buffer, such shall provide a year-round state of being
substantially impervious to rays of light. It shall be acceptable to
incorporate fencing as part of the landscape buffer where noise and lights
create a need that such landscape buffer include fencing. Fencing may also be
used to provide landscape screening. Wherever used, fences shall be of a
decorative style and type. Walls and berms shall be used only in the most
unusual cases.
   The desired buffering or screening effect shall be achieved not later than
twelve months after the initial installation. The Planning and Design
Commission may extend this twelve month period of time when a hardship would be
created because of expected growth or material shortages, but such extension
shall not be for more than two years from the time the initial installation was
to have been or has been installed. All buffering and screening requirements
imposed under the provisions of this subsection shall be installed and
constructed before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a new building or
structure. No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon shall be expanded, altered or modified until the plans are submitted by
the owner or developer to the Planning and Design Commission for its
determination as to whether the change adversely affects any properties in a
Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon. The Commission, after its review, shall require, where necessary, the
establishment of a landscape buffering area or the installation of landscape
screening, or a revision of a previously established buffered area or
screening. The width and height of the landscape buffer or landscape screening
shall be determined by the Planning and Design Commission provided, however,
that the maximum height of fencing, whether incorporated as part of the
landscape buffer or whether used as a landscape screen, which may be permitted
shall be seven feet above finished grade. The owner or developer shall be
responsible for the maintenance and replacement, if necessary, of the landscape
buffer or landscape screening.
   Owners or developers of off-street parking areas shall be required to
include a plan for buffering or screening the parking areas and driveways,
including a detailed description and sketch of the landscape buffer or
landscape screening which visually and verbally outlines the nature and the
effect of the proposed landscape buffer or landscape screening. A certificate
of occupancy shall not be granted until the buffering or screening requirements
have been completed. If completion, in the case of living materials, is delayed
because of the growing season, a temporary permit to occupy may be granted by
the Building Commissioner. Such delay shall not extend beyond the next growing
season following the date upon which the certificate of occupancy is requested.
(Ord. 95-67. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (d)    The Planning and Design Commission may require landscaping of lands
to break up the expanse of pavement for a parking area of twenty or more
vehicles to carry out the objectives of this Zoning Code and to preserve the
use and enjoyment of adjoining property.

1113.10 APPROVAL OF OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES.
   Detailed drawings of off-street parking facilities shall be submitted to the
Planning and Design Commission for review and approval in accordance with all
the provisions of this chapter before a building permit or certificate of
occupancy may be issued. Such drawings shall show the number of spaces and
locations, dimensions and descriptions of all features as set forth in this
chapter. (Ord. 84-93. Passed 6-17-85.)
1113.11 ILLUMINATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES; ACCESSWAYS.
   Areas used to provide required off-street parking, and accessways thereto,
shall be illuminated whenever deemed necessary by the Planning and Design
Commission to protect the public safety. Illumination shall be reduced in
intensity after the close of business of the main use or uses. Lighting
fixtures shall be so designed and located as not to reflect direct rays of
light upon adjoining residential properties and streets or cause a glare
hazardous to pedestrians or drivers of motor vehicles on adjacent public
streets, and shall be subject to the approval of the Commission. (Ord. 84-93.
Passed 6-17-85.)
1113.12 SURVEY AND APPROVAL OF THE CITY ENGINEER REQUIRED.

application for a building permit and shall forward his approval to the
Building Commissioner prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(Ord. 95-67. Passed 10-16-95.)
1113.13 APPLICATION AND DESIGN OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Application for Providing Facilities. An application for a building
permit pertaining to constructing a building or parking facility or for a
certificate of occupancy for a change in use of land or a building shall
include a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing the proposed
design of the parking area to be provided in accordance with the space
requirement schedules that are a part of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 84-93. Passed 6-17-85.)
   (b)    Determination of Required Parking Facilities. The minimum number of
spaces required for accessory off-street parking shall be determined by
applying the measurement standards in Section
1113.06 , the standards for designing parking areas in subsection (c) hereof,
the schedule of accessory parking requirements for the various uses in Section
1113.07  and any other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
   The Planning and Design Commission may modify the parking requirements of
Section
1113.07 under such terms and conditions as it determines will protect the
public interest where it finds based upon the factual evidence presented that
due to the nature of the particular use such requirements will not be adequate
to provide sufficient parking or where the strict application of the
requirements will result in an excessive amount of parking related to the
particular use.
(Ord. 95-67. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (c)    Design Standards. The plan of the parking spaces of a parking area
included with an application to construct a building or parking area, or change
in use, shall be designed, dimensioned and the number of spaces determined in

the Planning and Zoning Commission. Design standards for enclosed parking areas
and garages, shall be in accordance with other provisions of the Zoning Code.

provisions of the Ohio Basic Building Code.
(Ord. 84-93. Passed 6-17-85.)
1113.14 REQUIRED TRASH AREAS.
   All civic and recreational uses that provide trash and/or garbage collection
areas shall be enclosed on at least three sides by a solid wall or fence of at
least four feet in height if such area is not within an enclosed building or
structure. Provisions for adequate vehicular access to and from such area or
areas for collection of trash and/or garbage as determined by the Planning and
Design Commission shall be required.
(Ord. 84-93. Passed 6-17-85.)
1113.15 DEPOSIT FOR SURVEY OF PUBLIC SANITARY AND STORM SEWERS.
   A deposit by the applicant for a building permit shall be made with the
Finance Director in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) to cover
the cost and expense of such survey of public sanitary and storm sewers. The
cost and expense of such survey shall be paid by the City from such deposit.

1121.25 ACCESSORY PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities shall be determined in conformance
with the provisions of this chapter as a condition precedent to the occupancy
of the several buildings or uses.
   (a)    Whenever a building is constructed or a new use established,
facilities shall be provided for the entire building or use on the same lot or
on an adjoining lot under the same ownership;
   (b)    Whenever the use of an existing building is changed to a use
requiring more parking facilities, or whenever an existing building is altered
and there is an increase of the number of dwelling units, or other measurement
criteria, facilities shall be provided for the additional building or use on
the same lot or on an adjoining lot under the same ownership; or
   (c)    Required off-street parking facilities, including access driveways,
accessory to an existing use, and those required as accessory to a use created
or a building constructed or altered hereafter, shall be continued and
maintained in operation, and shall not be reduced below the requirements during
the period that the main use is maintained. Failure by the owner or owners to
supply such off-street parking shall cause the Building Commissioner to revoke
the occupancy of a sufficient number of the dwelling units in order to bring
the facility into conformity with parking requirements. Accessory off-street
parking facilities shall not be used for the rebuilding, overhauling, or
dismantling of any vehicle as defined in Section
301.51  or for the storage of motor or body parts. Accessory off-street parking
facilities may be used for minor repair services on passenger vehicles of an
occupant or tenant only. Permitted minor repair services shall be completed
within forty-eight hours; otherwise such repairs shall be performed within a
permitted building. (Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85.)
1121.26 MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   The following definitions and standards shall be used to determine accessory
off-street parking requirements:
   (a)    "Accessory parking space" means an open or enclosed area (garage)
directly accessible from a public street for parking of motor vehicles of
owners, occupants, employees, customers or tenants of the main building or use.
Each space shall be directly accessible from a drive or aisle, and shall have a
minimum rectangular dimension of not less than nine feet in width and eighteen
feet in length for ninety degree parking; nine feet in width and twenty-two
feet in length for parallel parking; ten feet in width and eighteen feet in
length for sixty degree parking and twelve feet in width and eighteen feet in
length for forty-five degree parking, exclusive of all drives, aisles, ramps
and other circulation areas, and determined from an accurate plan of the area.
   (b)    Required Minimum Parking Spaces. Where the computation results in a
fractional unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided.
      (Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85.)
1121.27 SCHEDULE.
   Each dwelling unit in any Multi-Family District shall be provided with two
off-street parking spaces. At least fifty percent of the required parking
spaces shall be enclosed.
   (a)    For one building of eight suites or less, the enclosed spaces shall
be in a garage structure built above or below ground level.
   (b)    For a building or development of more than eight suites such enclosed
parking spaces shall be:
      (1)    In a structure, all of which is at, or below, the level of the
surrounding finished grade. Such structure shall be on the same lot as the main
building or on an adjoining lot under the same ownership; and/or
      (2)    Above or below the level of the surrounding finished grade within
the walls of the main building.
   For any other building or use not shown, the Planning and Design Commission
shall apply the unit of measurement required by the provisions in this Zoning
Code or where no specific requirement is set forth in this Zoning Code that
unit of measurement deemed to be the most similar to the proposed use by the
Commission.
(Ord. 95-68. Passed 10-16-95.)
1121.28 ACCESSWAYS TO PARKING AREAS.
   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking facilities
shall be planned to interfere as little as possible with the use of nearby
property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the adjacent streets.
Whenever possible, the center line of the access driveways on the frontage
street shall be at least forty feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest
intersecting street and spaced at not less than 120-foot intervals, measured
from the center line of the driveway.
   Parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles may be driven forward into
the street. Parking areas of fifteen spaces or less shall have at least one
single-lane driveway, and the maximum width occupied by all driveways shall be
twenty-four feet. Parking areas of sixteen spaces or more shall have two
single-lane driveways if possible or at least one two-lane driveway; each
accessway shall be limited to two lanes.
   The width of such entrances and exits, measured at the setback line, shall
conform to the following schedule:
 
Lanes Minimum Feet Maximum Feet
One   10           12
Two   18           24
 
   The angle of intersection between the driveway and the street shall be
between sixty degrees and ninety degrees. The radius at the edge from the apron
shall be at least twelve feet, twenty feet recommended, so that a motor vehicle
entering or leaving may not obstruct vehicles in other traffic lanes in the
driveway or in the curb lane of the street.
(Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85.)
1121.29 LOCATION AND USE OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Accessory parking facilities shall not be permitted in required front yards.
Driveways shall not be used for parking within required front yards.
(Ord. 95-68. Passed 10-16-95.)
1121.30 SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Proposed and existing parking areas and access driveways shall be
improved with asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete or other impervious
surface and shall be so graded and drained into proper inlets so that all water
is drained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway is located in
such manner that water shall not drain across other public or private property.
   (b)    Parking areas shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with the design
standards in this chapter and shall be improved, except at entrances and exits
with guard rails, curbs or other devices to define parking spaces or limits of
paved areas, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles into adjacent areas or
public ways, yards or setbacks required by the Zoning Code, and so as to
regulate the flow of traffic within the lot.
(Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85.)
   (c)    The Planning and Design Commission may require landscape buffering or
landscape screening to be provided on the parking area property to insulate the
parking areas and driveways from a side or rear lot line of other property in
any Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing
residence thereon. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited
to, evergreen trees and bushes, compact hedges, shrubs, earth berms or a
combination thereof. Landscape screening shall include plant material or other
nonliving durable material, including, but not limited to, walls, berms or
substantially solid decorative wood fencing. Where trees and shrubs are used to
provide a landscape buffer, such shall provide a year-round state of being
substantially impervious to rays of light. It shall be acceptable to
incorporate fencing as part of the landscape buffer where noise and lights
create a need that such landscape buffer include fencing. Fencing may also be
used to provide landscape screening. Whenever used, fences shall be of a
decorative style and type. Walls and berms shall be used only in the most
unusual cases.
   The desired buffering or screening effect shall be achieved not later than
twelve months after the initial installation. The Planning and Design
Commission may extend this twelve month period of time when a hardship would be
created because of expected growth or material shortages, but such extension
shall not be for more than two years from the time the initial installation was
to have been or has been installed. All buffering and screening requirements
imposed under the provisions of this subsection shall be installed and
constructed before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a new building or
structure. No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon shall be expanded, altered or modified until the plans are submitted by
the owner or developer to the Planning and Design Commission for its
determination as to whether the change adversely affects any properties in a
Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon. The Commission, after its review, shall require, where necessary, the
establishment of a landscape buffering area or the installation of landscape
screening, or a revision of a previously established buffered area or
screening. The width and height of the landscape buffer or landscape screening
shall be determined by the Planning and Design Commission, provided, however,
that the maximum height of fencing, whether incorporated as part of the
landscape buffer or whether used as a landscape screen, which may be permitted
shall be seven feet above natural grade. The owner or developer shall be
responsible for the maintenance and replacement, if necessary, of the landscape
buffer or landscape screening.
   Owners or developers of off-street parking areas shall be required to
include a plan for buffering or screening the parking areas and driveways,
including a detailed description and sketch of the landscape buffer or
landscape screening which visually and verbally outlines the nature and the
effect of the proposed landscape buffer or landscape screening. A certificate
of occupancy shall not be granted until the buffering or screening requirements
have been completed. If completion, in the case of living materials, is delayed
because of the growing season, a temporary permit to occupy may be granted by
the Building Commissioner. Such delay shall not extend beyond the next growing
season following the date upon which the certificate of occupancy is requested.
(Ord. 95-68. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (d)    In order to carry out the objectives of this Zoning Code and to
preserve the use and enjoyment of adjoining property not less than five percent
(5%) of an off-street parking area of a lot with twenty or more off-street
accessory parking spaces shall have landscaping islands to break up the expanse
of pavement. Each landscaping island shall not be less in size than the
required area of one off-street parking space, shall be interspersed throughout
the entire off-street parking area and shall have trees and such other
landscaping as may be required by the Planning and Design Commission. Areas of
landscaping surrounded by at least three sides by accessory off-street parking
areas or accessories to parking areas may be considered a landscaped island.
(Ord. 98-38. Passed 7-6-98.)
1121.31 APPROVAL OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Detailed drawings of off-street parking facilities shall be submitted to the
Planning and Design Commission for review and approval in accordance with all
the provisions of this chapter before a building permit or certificate of
occupancy may be issued. Such drawings shall show the number of spaces and
locations, dimensions and descriptions of all features as set forth in this
chapter. (Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85.)
1121.32 ILLUMINATION OF ACCESSORY PARKING FACILITIES.
   Areas used to provide required off-street parking, and accessways thereto,
shall be illuminated whenever deemed necessary by the Planning and Design
Commission to protect the public safety. Lighting fixtures shall be so designed
and located so as not to reflect direct rays of light upon adjoining
residential properties, occupants of the building and streets or cause a glare
hazardous to pedestrians or drivers of motor vehicles on adjacent public
streets, and shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
(Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85. )
1121.33 RECREATIONAL FACILITIES ON SINGLE-FAMILY PORTION OF MULTI-FAMILY
PARCEL.
   A lot or parcel may be divided by a zoning district boundary. When the rear
portion of such lot lies in a One or Two-Family Residential District, such
portion may be used for recreational purposes in conjunction with a residential
building located on the front, or multi-family residential portion, of the lot.
Such landscape features and recreational yard structures as may be permitted in
Section
1117.17, shall be permitted, provided yard and other regulations of this Zoning
Code and other City ordinances are complied with. The Planning and Design
Commission may require the erection of a wall, fence or other screening along
that portion of the lot line adjacent to residences in a One or Two-Family
Residential District.
(Ord. 67-17. Passed 5-15-67.)
1121.34 SURVEY AND APPROVAL OF CITY ENGINEER REQUIRED.
   The City Engineer shall make a survey of the public sanitary and storm
sewers to be affected by the proposed building or use set forth in the
application for a building permit and shall forward his approval to the
Building Commissioner prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(Ord. 95-68. Passed 10-16-95.)
1121.35 APPLICATION AND DESIGN OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Application for Providing Facilities. An application for a building
permit pertaining to constructing a building or parking facility or for a
certificate of occupancy for a change in use of land or a building shall
include a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing the proposed
design of the parking area to be provided in accordance with the space
requirement schedules that are a part of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Determination of Required Parking Facilities. The minimum number of
spaces required for accessory off-street parking shall be determined by
applying the measurement standards in Section
1121.26 , the standards for designing parking areas in subsection (c) hereof,
the schedule of accessory parking requirements for the various uses in Section
1121.27  and any other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.

   (c)    Design Standards. The plan of the parking spaces of a parking area
included with an application to construct a building or parking area, or change
in use, shall be designed, dimensioned and the number of spaces determined in
accordance with the Standards for Designing Parking Areas as may be adopted by
the Planning and Design Commission. Design standards for enclosed parking areas
and garages, shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 95-68. Passed 10-16-95.)
1121.36 REQUIRED TRASH AREAS.
   All multi-family residential uses that provide trash and/or garbage
collection areas shall be enclosed on at least three sides by a solid wall or
fence of at least four feet in height if such area is not within an enclosed
building or structure. Provisions for adequate vehicular access to and from
such area or areas for collection of trash and/or garbage as determined by the
Planning and Design Commission shall be required.
(Ord. 84-94. Passed 6-17-85.)

1129.14 ACCESSORY PARKING FACILITIES REQUIRED.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities, including access driveways, shall
be determined in conformance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
   (a)    Such facilities shall be provided on the same lot or on an adjoining
lot under the same ownership whenever:
      (1)    A building is constructed;
      (2)    An existing building is altered, resulting in an increase in
measurement capacity.
   (b)    Required off-street parking facilities, including access driveways,
accessory to an existing use, and those required as accessory to a use created
or a building constructed or altered hereafter, shall be continued and
maintained in operation and shall not be reduced below the requirements during
the period that the main use is maintained. Failure by the owner or owners to
supply such off-street parking shall cause the Building Commissioner to revoke
the occupancy of a sufficient number of the units in order to bring the
facility into conformity with parking requirements. Accessory off-street
parking facilities shall not be used for the rebuilding, overhauling or
dismantling of any vehicle as defined in Section 
301.51  or for the storage of motor or body parts or for minor repair services
on any vehicle.
   (c)    Required parking spaces may be either enclosed, underground or open.
      (Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.15 MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)    "Accessory parking space" means an open or enclosed area (garage)
directly accessible from a public street for parking of motor vehicles of
owners, occupants, employees, customers or tenants of the main building or use.
Each space shall be directly accessible from a drive or aisle, and shall have a
minimum rectangular dimension of not less than nine feet in width and eighteen
feet in length for ninety degree parking; nine feet in width and twenty-two
feet in length for parallel parking; ten feet in width and eighteen feet in
length for sixty degree parking and twelve feet in width and eighteen feet in
length for forty-five degree parking, exclusive of all drives, aisles, ramps
and other circulation areas, and determined from an accurate plan of the area.
   (b)    "Floor area" means the total area of all the floors of the building
measured from the exterior faces of the building. Basement areas or other
floors or parts thereof designed, arranged or used exclusively for storage or
similar uses may be excluded from the floor area if the areas or floors or
parts thereof are not open to the public.
   Such areas as stairs, hallways, restrooms, equipment or furnace rooms,
elevator shafts, etc. shall be excluded.
   (c)    When the computation results in a fractional unit, one additional
space shall be provided. (Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.16 SCHEDULE.
   For other than medical and dental offices and clinics, one off-street
parking space per each 150 square feet of floor area of 6,000 square feet or
less; forty off-street parking spaces plus one space per each 200 square feet
of floor area over 6,000 square feet. For medical and dental offices and
clinics, one off-street parking space shall be provided per each 100 square
feet of floor area to 10,000 square feet and one space per each 200 square feet
of floor area over 10,000 square feet. (Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.17 ACCESSWAYS TO PARKING AREAS.
   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking facilities
shall be planned so as to interfere as little as possible with the use of
nearby property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the adjacent
streets.
   (a)    Whenever possible, the center line of the access driveways on the
frontage streets shall be at least forty feet from the right-of-way line of the
nearest intersecting street and be spaced at not less than 120-foot intervals,
measured from the center line of the driveways.
   (b)    Parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles can be driven
forward into the street. Those of fifteen spaces or less shall have at least
one single-lane or one two-lane driveway; those of sixteen spaces or more shall
have at least two single-lane, or one two-lane driveway. Each entrance to, or
exit from, a parking area of sixteen spaces or more shall be limited to two
lanes.
   (c)    The widths of driveways, measured at the setback line, shall conform
to the following schedule. At no point where adjoining a public sidewalk shall
the maximum widths be exceeded.
 
Lanes Minimum feet Maximum feet
One   10           12
Two   18           24
   (d)    The angle of intersection between the driveway and the street shall
be between sixty degrees and ninety degrees. The radius at the edge from the
apron shall be at least twelve feet, twenty feet recommended, so that a motor
vehicle entering or leaving may not obstruct vehicles in other traffic lanes in
the driveway or in the curb lane of the street.
      (Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.18 SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Proposed and existing parking areas and access driveways shall be
improved with asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete or other impervious
surface and shall be so graded and drained into proper inlets so that all water
is drained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway is located in
such manner that water shall not drain across other public or private property.
   (b)    Parking areas shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with the design
standards in this chapter, and shall be improved, except at entrances and exits
with guardrails, curbs or other devices to define parking spaces or limits of
paved areas, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles into adjacent areas or
public ways, yards or setbacks required by the Zoning Code, and so as to
regulate the flow of traffic within the lot.
   (c)    The Planning and Design Commission may require landscape buffering or
landscape screening to be provided on the parking area property to insulate the
parking areas and driveways from a side or rear lot line of other property in
Residential Districts or any other Zoning District with an existing residence
thereon. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited to,
evergreen trees and bushes, compact hedges, shrubs, earth berms or a
combination thereof. Landscape screening shall include plant material or other
nonliving durable material, including, but not limited to, walls, berms or
substantially solid decorative wood fencing. Where trees and shrubs are used to
provide a landscape buffer, such shall provide a year-round state of being
substantially impervious to rays of light. It shall be acceptable to
incorporate fencing as part of the landscape buffer where noise and lights
create a need that such landscape buffer include fencing. Fencing may also be
used to provide landscape screening. Whenever used, fences shall be of a
decorative style and type. Walls and berms shall be used only in the most
unusual cases.
   The desired buffering or screening effect shall be achieved not later than
twelve months after the initial installation. The Planning and Design
Commission may extend this twelve month period of time when a hardship would be
created because of expected growth or material shortages, but such extension
shall not be for more than two years from the time the initial installation was
to have been or has been installed. All buffering and screening requirements
imposed under the provisions of this subsection shall be installed and
constructed before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a new building or
structure. No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon shall be expanded, altered or modified until the plans are submitted by
the opener on developer to the Planning and Design Commission for its
determination as to whether the change adversely affects any properties in a
Residential District or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon. The Commission, after its review, shall require, where necessary, the
establishment of a landscape buffering area or the installation of landscape
screening, or a revision of a previously established buffered area or
screening. The width and height of the landscape buffer or landscape screening
shall be determined by the Planning and Design Commission provided, however,
that the maximum height of fencing, whether incorporated as part of the
landscape buffer or whether used as a landscape screen, which may be permitted
shall be seven feet above finished grade. The owner, tenant and developer shall
be responsible for the maintenance and replacement, if necessary, of the
landscape buffer or landscape screening.
   Owners or developers of off-street parking areas shall be required to
include a plan for buffering or screening the parking areas and driveways,
including a detailed description and sketch of the landscape buffer or
landscape screening which visually and verbally outlines the nature and the
effect of the proposed landscape buffer or landscape screening. A certificate
of occupancy shall not be granted until the buffering or screening requirements
have been completed. If completion, in the case of living materials, is delayed
because of the growing season, a temporary permit to occupy may be granted by
the Building Commissioner. Such delay shall not extend beyond the next growing
season following the date upon which the certificate of occupancy is requested.
   (d)    In order to carry out the objectives of this Zoning Code and to
preserve the use and enjoyment of adjoining property not less than five percent
(5%) of an off-street parking area of a lot with twenty or more off-street
accessory parking spaces shall have landscaping islands to break up the expanse
of pavement. Each landscaping island shall not be less in size than the
required area of one off-street parking space, shall be interspersed throughout
the entire off-street parking area and shall have trees and such other
landscaping as may be required by the Planning and Design Commission. Areas of
landscaping surrounded by at least three sides by accessory off-street parking
areas or accessories to parking areas may be considered a landscaped island.
(Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.19 APPROVAL OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Detailed drawings of off-street parking facilities shall be submitted to the
Planning and Design Commission for review and approval in accordance with all
the provisions of this chapter before a building permit or certificate of
occupancy may be issued. Such drawings shall show the number of spaces and
locations, dimensions and descriptions of all features as set forth in this
chapter. (Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.20 ILLUMINATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Areas used to provide required off-street parking, and accessways thereto
shall be illuminated whenever deemed necessary by the Planning and Design
Commission to protect the public safety. The illumination of parking areas in
office building districts shall be reduced in intensity after the close of
business of the main use or uses. Lighting fixtures shall be so designed and
located so as not to reflect direct rays of light upon adjoining residential
properties and streets or cause a glare hazardous to pedestrians or drivers of
motor vehicles on adjacent public streets, and shall be subject to the approval
of the Commission.
(Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.21 APPLICATION AND DESIGN OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Application for Providing Facilities. An application for a building
permit pertaining to constructing a building or parking facility or for a
certificate of occupancy for a change in use of land or a building shall
include a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing the proposed
design of the parking area to be provided in accordance with the space
requirement schedules that are a part of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Determination of Required Parking Facilities. The minimum number of
spaces required for accessory off-street parking shall be determined by
applying the measurement standards in Section
1129.15 , the standards for designing parking areas in subsection (c) hereof,
the schedule of accessory parking requirements for the various uses in Section
1129.16  and any other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
   The Planning and Design Commission may modify the parking requirements of
Section
1129.16 under such terms and conditions as it determines will protect the
public interest where it finds based upon the factual evidence presented that
due to the nature of the particular use such requirements will not be adequate
to provide sufficient parking or where the strict application of the
requirements will result in an excessive amount of parking related to the
particular use.
(Ord. 95-69. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (c)    Design Standards. The plan of the parking spaces of a parking area
included with an application to construct a building or parking area, or change
in use, shall be designed, dimensioned and the number of spaces determined in
accordance with the standards for designing parking areas as may be adopted by
the Commission and which is part of this Zoning Code. Design standards for
enclosed parking areas and garages, shall be in accordance with other
provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (d)    Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
provisions of the Ohio Basic Building Code.
(Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16. )
1129.22 REQUIRED TRASH AREAS.
   All office building uses that provide trash and/or garbage collection areas
shall be enclosed on at least three sides by a solid wall or fence of at least
four feet in height if such area is not within an enclosed building or
structure. Provisions for adequate vehicular access to and from such area or
areas for collection of trash and/or garbage as determined by the Planning and
Design Commission shall be required.
(Ord. 16-16A. Passed 6-20-16.)
1129.23 APPROVAL OF CITY ENGINEER REQUIRED.
   The City Engineer shall make a survey of the public sanitary and storm
sewers to be affected by the proposed building or use set forth in the
application for a building permit and shall forward his approval to the
Building Commissioner prior to the issuance of a building permit.

1137.01 RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS.
   (a)    Residential buildings, or parts thereof, located in Business
Districts, shall comply with each and all of the regulations established in
Multi-Family Districts, except multi-family housing for the elderly and
handicapped authorized under Section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as
amended, Public Law 86-372, 73 Stat. 667, 12 U.S.C. §1701q shall comply with
each and all of the regulations adopted pursuant thereto when in conflict with
this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Buildings and structures, or parts thereof, used for one- or two-
family residences, or intended to be used as such, shall not be permitted on
the same zoning lot on which is located a commercial or business establishment
or use of any kind. Except as otherwise specifically provided in and permitted
by Section
1137.015, existing one- and two-family residences, whether detached from or
attached to or part of another structure on the same zoning lot or whether an
integral part of a structure on a zoning lot, shall not be occupied, in whole
or in part, by any other use or converted into a commercial or business
establishment or use.
(Ord. 92-48. Passed 7-6-92.)
1137.015 CONVERSION OF RESIDENTIAL DWELLINGS TO LIMITED COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS
USE.
   (a)    An existing one- or two-family dwelling, whether detached from or
attached to or part of another structure on the same zoning lot or whether an
integral part of a structure on a zoning lot may be converted to and thereafter
occupied and used for the uses permitted by this section subject to the
provisions of this section.
   (b)    Design Criteria and Requirements. The following design criteria and
requirements shall apply to all one- and two-family residences converted to and
thereafter occupied and used for the uses permitted by this section:
      (1)    The entire building or structure shall be redesigned and
reconstructed to express and serve the proposed use in regard to exterior
design, the building plan and the site plan.
      (2)    The dwelling shall, to the maximum extent possible, be renovated
and preserved to its original design except as may be necessary to comply with
other applicable ordinances of the City, the provisions of this section and
such concepts as are adopted by the Planning and Design Commission.
      (3)    In addition to such concepts as are adopted by the Commission, in
considering the appropriateness of any proposed exterior design or of any
change to the exterior surface of structures or of the appropriateness of
existing or proposed landscaping and exterior signs, the following criteria
shall be considered and applied by the Commission:
         A.    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period
building, structure or site shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration
of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be
avoided.
         B.    Alterations that have no historical basis or which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
design or integrity of the building shall be avoided.
         C.    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
         D.    Significant architectural details and features which have
deteriorated shall be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. In the
event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material
being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of architectural details and features should
be based on accurate duplications, and if possible, substantiated by historic,
physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the
availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or
structures.
         E.    The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Cleaning
methods that will damage the historic building materials shall be avoided.
         F.    Any reconstruction or rehabilitation shall conform to the
distinguishing, original exterior qualities and character of the structure and
its site.
         G.    The use of contemporary materials such as aluminum, other
metals, fiberglass and plastics for exterior surfaces shall be prohibited
unless it is specifically determined by the Commission that the use of such
materials would contribute to the preservation or enhancement of existing
traditional materials and the overall integrity and longevity of a structure.
         H.    Traditional colors and combinations of colors as approved by the
Commission shall be used for all structure exteriors including for all exterior
remodeling and exterior maintenance.
   (c)    Signs. All signs shall conform to the material and color provisions
of subsection (b) hereof, shall be of such a style and design that reflects the
era during which the structure was built, and shall otherwise conform to the
requirements of Chapter
1145  except that the structural type of such signs shall be limited to ground
signs, wall signs, and window signs as defined in Section
1145.03 (c). Such permitted signs shall not cover, "blank-out" or close
existing window or doorway openings or otherwise hide important architectural
details or features
   (d)    Interior Renovation. The interior of any dwelling converted to a
commercial or business establishment or use shall be renovated in a manner as
is necessary to comply with the Building Code and the National Electrical Code
as such are applicable to premises used for a commercial or business
establishment or use.
   (e)    Any existing one- or two-family dwelling, whether detached from or
attached to or part of another structure on the same zoning lot or whether an
integral part of a structure on a zoning lot, converted to or to be converted
to a commercial or business establishment or use, shall not be added to or
enlarged. Where the yards of existing one- or two-family dwellings are less
than the minimum required yards as set forth in Section
1137.07, such residential dwelling shall be considered as conforming with
respect to such yard requirements provided that yards of less dimensions than
that required by Section

                                                  greater number.
 
   (k)    Drive-in windows, pick-up and control stations, ticket booths and
similar facilities shall provide spaces in a waiting line of not less than 120
feet on the lot occupied by the facility for each such service point. Driveways
to such service and parking areas shall be located in accordance with
provisions of Section
1137.15.
   (l)    For a specific building or use not scheduled above, the Planning and
Design Commission shall apply the unit of measurement from the above schedule
deemed to be the most similar to the proposed building or use.
      (Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.13 MODIFICATION TO SCHEDULE.
   When an existing building or use, except residential, does not conform to
parking requirements as set forth in this chapter, and where land is not
available for parking on the same lot, the Planning and Design Commission may
modify the location of parking facilities to permit such facilities on an
adjoining lot under the same ownership or may modify the location of parking
facilities to permit such facilities to be shared in an amount not to exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the parking requirements in an adjoining Civic and
Recreational District where the main use(s) normally has different hours of
operation. Where there is a joint use of parking facilities on an adjoining lot
under the same ownership or in an adjoining Civic and Recreational District,
there shall be a written agreement covering such indefinite period of time as
may be required by the Planning and Design Commission whereby the owner of the
land on which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by a long
term lease or by a covenant filed and recorded in the office of the County
Recorder requiring such owner, his heirs, successors or assigns to maintain a
required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served as a
condition precedent to the continuation of such use provided however that the
joint use of such spaces shall not reduce the number exclusively provided for
the use or uses on such adjoining lot to less than that required by this
chapter and provided further that should any of the uses on such adjoining lot
be changed so as to require additional parking spaces or the joint use of the
facilities be discontinued, then the required spaces for the use or uses served
by such facilities shall be provided on another adjoining lot under the same
ownership as a condition precedent to the continued use of such building(s) or
use(s). (Ord. 95-71. Passed 10-16-95.)
1137.14 SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES.
   A building occupied by one use shall provide the off-street spaces as
required for the specific use. A building, or group of buildings, occupied by
two or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, shall provide
spaces for not less than the sum of the spaces required for each use. A large
unit development of business uses, such as a regional shopping center or office
building complex shall provide spaces for the total floor area of the building
or buildings, instead of the requirements based on separate uses.
   Whenever a group of adjoining stores and services have been developed and
owned separately, the Planning and Design Commission may find it to be in the
public interest to require the coordination of the circulation system, ingress
and egress driveways and insulation from surrounding residential uses.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.15 ACCESSWAYS TO PARKING AREAS.
   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to parking facilities
shall be planned as to interfere as little as possible with the use of nearby
property and with pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the adjacent streets.
   (a)    Whenever possible, the center line of the access driveways on the
frontage streets shall be at least forty feet from the right-of-way line of the
nearest intersecting street and be spaced not less than 120-foot intervals,
measured from the center line of the driveways.
   (b)    Parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles can be driven
forward into the street. Those of fifteen spaces or less shall have at least
one single-lane driveway with a maximum of two single-lane or one two-lane
driveway; those of sixteen spaces or more shall have at least two single-lane,
or one two-lane driveway. Each entrance to, or exit from, a parking area of
sixteen spaces or more shall be limited to two lanes.
   (c)    The widths of driveways, measured at the setback line, shall conform
to the following schedule. At no point where adjoining a public sidewalk shall
the maximum widths be exceeded.
 
Lanes Minimum Feet Maximum Feet
One   10           12
Two   18           24
 
   The angle of intersection between the driveway and street shall be between
sixty degrees and ninety degrees. The radius at the edge from the apron shall
be at least twelve feet, twenty feet recommended, so that a motor vehicle
entering or leaving may not obstruct vehicles in other traffic lanes in the
driveway or in the curb lane of the street.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.16 SURFACE IMPROVEMENT OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Proposed and existing parking areas and access driveways shall be
improved with asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete or other impervious
surface and shall be so graded and drained into proper inlets so that all water
is drained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway is located in
such manner that water shall not drain across other public or private property.
   (b)    Parking areas shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with the design
standards in this chapter, and shall be improved, except at entrances and exits
with guard rails, curbs or other devices to define parking spaces or limits of
paved areas, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles into adjacent areas or
public ways, yards or setbacks required by the Zoning Code, and so as to
regulate the flow of traffic within the lot.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
   (c)    The Planning and Design Commission may require landscape buffering or
landscape screening to be provided on the parking area property to insulate the
parking areas and driveways from a side or rear lot line of other property in
Residential Districts or any other Zoning District with an existing residence
thereon. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited to,
evergreen trees and bushes, compact hedges, shrubs, earth berms or a
combination thereof. Landscape screening shall include plant material or other
nonliving durable material, including, but not limited to, walls, berms or
substantially solid decorative wood fencing. Where trees and shrubs are used to
provide a landscape buffer, such shall provide a year-round state of being
substantially impervious to rays of light. It shall be acceptable to
incorporate fencing as part of the landscape buffer where noise and lights
create a need that such landscape buffer include fencing. Fencing may also be
used to provide landscape screening. Whenever used, fences shall be of a
decorative style and type. Walls and berms shall be used only in the most
unusual cases.
   The desired buffering or screening effect shall be achieved not later than
twelve months after the initial installation. The Planning and Design
Commission may extend this twelve month period of time when a hardship would be
created because of expected growth or material shortages, but such extension
shall not be for more than two years from the time the initial installation was
to have been or has been installed. All buffering and screening requirements
imposed under the provisions of this subsection shall be installed and
constructed before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a new building or
structure. No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
Residential District or any other Zoning District with an existing residence
thereon shall be expanded, altered or modified until the plans are submitted by
the owner or developer to the Planning and Design Commission for its
determination as to whether the change adversely affects any properties in a
Residential District or any other Zoning District with an existing residence
thereon. The Commission, after its review, shall require, where necessary, the
establishment of a landscape buffering area or the installation of landscape
screening, or a revision of a previously established buffered area or
screening. The width and height of the landscape buffer or landscape screening
shall be determined by the Planning and Design Commission provided, however,
that the maximum height of fencing, whether incorporated as part of the
landscape buffer or whether used as a landscape screen, which may be permitted
shall be seven feet above finished grade. The owner, tenant or developer shall
be responsible for the maintenance and replacement, if necessary, of the
landscape buffer or landscape screening.
   Owners or developers of off-street parking areas shall be required to
include a plan for buffering or screening the parking areas and driveways,
including a detailed description and sketch of the landscape buffer or
landscape screening which visually and verbally outlines the nature and the
effect of the proposed landscape buffer or landscape screening. A certificate
of occupancy shall not be granted until the buffering or screening requirements
have been completed. If completion, in the case of living materials, is delayed
because of the growing season, a temporary permit to occupy may be granted by
the Building Commissioner. Such delay shall not extend beyond the next growing
season following the date upon which the certificate of occupancy is requested.
(Ord. 95-71. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (d)    In order to carry out the objectives of this Zoning Code and to
preserve the use and enjoyment of adjoining property not less than five percent
(5%) of an off-street parking area of a lot with twenty or more off-street
accessory parking spaces shall have landscaping islands to break up the expanse
of pavement. Each landscaping island shall not be less in size than the
required area of one off-street parking space, shall be interspersed throughout
the entire off-street parking area and shall have trees and such other
landscaping as may be required by the Planning and Design Commission. Areas of
landscaping surrounded by at least three sides by accessory off-street parking
areas or accessories to parking areas may be considered a landscaped island.
(Ord. 98-38. Passed 7-6-98.)
1137.17 OFF-STREET LOADING SPACE.
   Accessory loading and unloading facilities shall be provided as a condition
precedent to occupancy of all general business hereafter erected, or altered to
such use, and shall be maintained as long as the building is occupied by such
uses.
   (a)    Allocation of Use. Space required and allocated for any off-street
loading facility shall not, while so allocated be used to satisfy the space
requirements for off-street parking. An off-street loading space shall not be
used for repairing or servicing of motor vehicles.
   (b)    Location of Facility. All required accessory loading facilities shall
be related to the building and use served to provide for loading and off-
loading of delivery and other service vehicles and shall be so arranged that
they may be used without blocking or otherwise interfering with the use of
access ways, parking facilities, public streets or sidewalks. Such facilities
shall be located not less than forty-five feet from the front property line
when facing the main street nor shall such facilities be located in a required
rear or side yards.
   (c)    Access Driveways. Each required off-street loading space shall be
designed for direct vehicular access by means of a driveway or driveways, to a
public street in a manner which will least interfere with adjacent traffic
movements and interior circulation. The driveway shall be located so that the
driveway center line shall be not less than forty feet from the nearest
intersecting street right-of-way.
   (d)    Improvements. All accessory off-street loading spaces shall be
improved as required for parking areas.
   (e)    Minimum Size Criteria. A required off-street loading space shall be
at least twelve feet wide by at least thirty feet in length. This area shall be
exclusive of maneuvering space, and each loading facility shall have a vertical
clearance of at least fourteen feet.
   (f)    At least one off-street loading space shall be provided for each
building devoted to general business or storage having a gross floor area of
15,000 to 30,000 square feet and one additional space shall be provided for
each additional 40,000 square feet or fraction thereof.
      (Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.18 APPROVAL OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Detailed drawings of off-street parking (and/or loading) facilities shall be
submitted to the Planning and Design Commission for review and approval in
accordance with all the provisions of this chapter before a building permit or
certificate of occupancy may be issued. Such drawings shall show the number of
spaces and locations, dimensions and descriptions of all features as set forth
in this chapter.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.19 ILLUMINATION OF ACCESSORY PARKING FACILITIES.
   Areas used to provide required off-street parking, and accessways thereto,
shall be illuminated whenever deemed necessary by the Planning and Design
Commission to protect the public safety. The illumination of parking areas in
business districts shall be reduced in intensity after the close of business of
the main use or uses. Lighting fixtures shall be so designed and located so as
not to reflect direct rays of light upon adjoining residential properties and
streets or cause a glare hazardous to pedestrians or drivers of motor vehicles
on adjacent public streets, and shall be subject to the approval of the
Commission.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.20 SURVEY AND APPROVAL OF CITY ENGINEER REQUIRED.
   The City Engineer shall make a survey of the public sanitary and storm
sewers to be affected by the proposed building or use set forth in the
application for a building permit and shall forward his approval to the
Building Commissioner prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(Ord. 95-71. Passed 10-16-95.)
1137.21 APPLICATION AND DESIGN OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Application for Providing Facilities. An application for a building
permit pertaining to constructing a building or parking facility or for a
certificate of occupancy for a change in use of land or a building shall
include a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing the proposed
design of the parking area and loading facilities to be provided in accordance
with the space requirement schedules that are a part of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Determination of Required Parking Facilities. The minimum number of
spaces required for accessory off-street parking shall be determined by
applying the measurement standards in Section
1137.11 , the standards for designing parking areas in subsection (c) hereof,
the schedule of accessory parking requirements for the various uses in Section
1137.12  and any other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
   The Planning and Design Commission may modify the parking requirements of
Section
1137.12 under such terms and conditions as it determines will protect the
public interest where it finds based upon the factual evidence presented that
due to the nature of the particular use such requirements will not be adequate
to provide sufficient parking or where the strict application of the
requirements will result in an excessive amount of parking related to the
particular use.
(Ord. 95-71. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (c)    Design Standards. The plan of the parking spaces of a parking area
included with an application to construct a building or parking area, or change
in use, shall be designed, dimensioned and the number of spaces determined in
accordance with such standards for designing as may be adopted by the Planning
and Design Commission. Design standards for enclosed parking areas and garages,
shall be in accordance with other provisions of the Zoning Code.
   (d)    Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
provisions of the Ohio Basic Building Code.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.22 REQUIRED TRASH AREAS.
   All general business uses that provide trash and/or garbage collection areas
shall be enclosed on at least three sides by a solid wall or fence of at least
four feet in height if such area is not with an enclosed building or structure.
Provisions for adequate vehicular access to and from such area or areas for
collection of trash and/or garbage as determined by the Planning and Design
Commission shall be required.
(Ord. 84-98. Passed 6-17-85.)
1137.23 DEPOSIT FOR SURVEY OF PUBLIC SANITARY AND STORM SEWERS.
   A deposit by the applicant for a building permit shall be made with the
Finance Director in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) to cover
the cost and expense of such survey of public sanitary and storm sewers. The
cost and expense of such survey shall be paid by the City from such deposit.

   but in no case shall the minimum distance be less than twenty feet.
      (2)    Where a building wall is opposite a side or rear lot line of a lot
in any district, the minimum distance between such wall and the side or rear
lot line shall be determined by using the following formulae:
D = PL + 2H
4
but in no case shall the minimum distance between the building and the property
line be less than twenty feet.
      (3)    Where lines drawn perpendicular from a building do not intersect
the walls of the adjacent building, the minimum distance between the two
buildings shall be determined by using the formulae:
D = 2(H1 + H2)
5
      (4)    The front yard (set back) for all buildings shall be not less than
fifty feet from the front lot line to the nearest exterior wall of the

(Ord. 95-72. Passed 10-16-95.)
1139.18 ILLUMINATION.
   Illumination of all exterior public areas shall be provided in the manner
required by the Building Code to protect the public safety. All illumination
shall be so designed and shielded so as not to shine, glare, reflect or be
directed into or towards any premises used for residential purposes, toward
public streets or on occupants of the building, and shall be approved by the
Planning and Design Commission.
(Ord. 81-19. Passed 5-4-81.)
1139.19 GARAGE AND OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (a)    Standards and Definitions. The following standards and definitions
shall be used to determine accessory off-street parking requirements.
      (1)    "Accessory parking space" means an open or enclosed area (garage)
directly accessible from a public street for parking of motor vehicles of
owners, occupants, employees, customers or tenants of the main building or use.
Each space shall be directly accessible from a drive or aisle, and shall have a
minimum rectangular dimension of not less than nine feet in width and eighteen
feet in length for ninety degree parking; nine feet in width and twenty two
feet in length for parallel parking; ten feet in width and eighteen feet in
length for sixty degree parking and twelve feet in width and eighteen feet in
length for forty-five degree parking, exclusive of all drives, aisles, ramps
and other circulation areas, and determined from an accurate plan of the area.
      (2)    "Employees" wherever the parking requirement is based on
employees, means the maximum number of employees on duty on the premises at one
time or on any two successive shifts, whichever is the greater.
      (3)    Required minimum parking spaces. Where the computation results in
a fractional unit, one additional off-street parking space shall be provided.
   (b)    Minimum Required. Off-street parking spaces may either be provided in
an enclosed garage or in an open lot and, except as otherwise provided by any
statute, code, law, rule or regulation specifically applicable to the
development project, shall be provided in accordance with the following
schedule:
      (1)    One parking space for each dwelling unit, plus one parking space
for each person employed at the development.
      (2)    When a multi-purpose senior center is developed as a main use
rather than as an ancillary facility, the number of off-street parking spaces
shall be provided in accordance with Section
1137.12 (a).
   (c)    Location of Off-Street Parking Facilities. Off-street parking shall
be provided for the entire building or use on the same lot or under an
adjoining lot under the same ownership whenever a building is constructed or
new use established or whenever an existing building is altered, resulting in
an increase of the number of dwelling units, seating capacity or other
measurement criteria. Accessory parking facilities shall not be permitted in
required front yards. Driveways shall not be used for permanent overnight
parking within required front yards.
   (d)    Separate or Combined Use of Facilities. A building containing one use
shall provide the required off-street parking spaces as required for the
specific use. A building or group of buildings, containing two or more uses
which have different off-street parking requirements shall provide parking
spaces for not less than the sum required for each use.
   (e)    Accessways to Parking Areas. The location and width of entrance and
exit driveways to parking facilities shall be planned as to interfere as little
as possible with the use of nearby property and with pedestrian and vehicular
traffic on the adjacent streets. Whenever possible, the center line of the
access driveways on the frontage streets shall be at least forty feet from the
right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street and spaced at not less
than 120 foot intervals, measured from the center line of the driveways.
   Parking areas shall be designed so that vehicles may be driven forward into
the street. Those of fifteen spaces or less shall have at least one single-lane
driveway with a maximum of two single-lane or one two-lane driveway; those
parking areas of sixteen spaces or more shall have two single lane driveways or
one two-lane driveway; and each accessway shall be limited to two lanes.
   The width of such entrances and exits, measured at the setback line, shall
conform to the following schedule:
 
Lanes Minimum Feet Maximum Feet
One   10           12
Two   18           24
   The angle of intersection between the driveway and the street shall be
between sixty degrees and ninety degrees. The radius at the edge from the apron
shall be at least twelve feet, twenty feet recommended, so that a motor vehicle
entering or leaving may not obstruct vehicles in other traffic lanes in the
driveway or in the curb lane of the street.
   (f)   Improvements to Parking Areas.
      (1)    Proposed and existing parking areas and access driveways shall be
improved with asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete or other impervious
surface and shall be so graded and drained into proper inlets so that all water
is drained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway, is located in
such manner that water shall not drain across other public or private property.
      (2)   Parking areas shall be so arranged and marked as to provide for
orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with the design
standards in this chapter, and shall be improved, except at entrances and exits
with guardrails, curbs or other devices to define parking spaces or limits of
paved areas, so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles into adjacent areas or
public ways, yards or setbacks required by the Zoning Code, and so as to
regulate the flow of traffic within the lot.
         (Ord. 84-99. Passed 12-16-85.)
      (3)    The Planning and Design Commission may require landscape buffering
or landscape screening to be provided on the parking area property to insulate
the parking areas and driveways from a side or rear lot line of other property
in Residential Districts or any other Zoning District with an existing
residence thereon. Landscape buffering may include, but shall not be limited
to, evergreen trees and bushes, compact hedges, shrubs, earth berms or a
combination thereof. Landscape screening shall include plant materials or other
nonliving durable material, including, but not limited to, walls, berms or
substantially solid decorative wood fencing. Where trees and shrubs are used to
provide a landscape buffer, such shall provide a year-round state of being
substantially impervious to rays of light. It shall be acceptable to
incorporate fencing as part of the landscape buffer where noise and lights
create a need that such landscape buffer include fencing. Fencing may also be
used to provide landscape screening. Whenever used, fences shall be of a
decorative style and type. Walls and berms shall be used only in the most
unusual cases. The desired buffering or screening effect shall be achieved not
later than twelve months after the initial installation. The Planning and
Design Commission may extend this twelve month period of time when a hardship
would be created because of expected growth or material shortages, but such
extension shall not be for more than two years from the time the initial
installation was to have been or has been installed. All buffering and
screening requirements imposed under the provisions of this subsection shall be
installed and constructed before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a new
building or structure.
   No existing building, structure or vehicular use area adjoining a
Residential District or any other Zoning District with an existing residence
thereon shall be expanded, altered or modified until the plans are submitted by
the owner or developer to the Planning and Design Commission for its
determination as to whether the change adversely affects any properties in a
Residential District or any other Zoning District with an existing residence
thereon. The Commission, after its review, shall require, where necessary, the
establishment of a landscape buffering area or the installation of landscape
screening, or a revision of a previously established buffered area or
screening. The width and height of the landscape buffer or landscape screening
shall be determined by the Planning and Design Commission provided, however,
that the maximum height of fencing, whether incorporated as part of the
landscape buffer or whether used as a landscape screen, which may be permitted
shall be seven feet above finished grade. The owner, tenant and developer shall
be responsible for the maintenance and replacement, if necessary, of the
landscape buffer or landscape screening. Owners or developers of off-street
parking areas shall be required to include a plan for buffering or screening
the parking areas and driveways, including a detailed description and sketch of
the landscape buffer or landscape screening which visually and verbally
outlines the nature and the effect of the proposed landscape buffer or
landscape screening. A certificate of occupancy shall not be granted until the
buffering or screening requirements have been completed. If completion, in the
case of living materials, is delayed because of the growing season, a temporary
permit to occupy may be granted by the Building Commissioner. Such delay shall
not extend beyond the next growing season following the date upon which the
certificate of occupancy is requested.
         (Ord. 95-72. Passed 10-16-95.)
      (4)    In order to carry out the objectives of this Zoning Code and to
preserve the use and enjoyment of adjoining property not less than five percent
(5%) of an off-street parking area of a lot with twenty or more off-street
accessory parking spaces shall have landscaping islands to break up the expanse
of pavement. Each landscaping island shall not be less in size than the
required area of one off-street parking space, shall be interspersed throughout
the entire off-street parking area and shall have trees and such other
landscaping as may be required by the Planning and Design Commission. Areas of
landscaping surrounded by at least three sides by accessory off-street parking
areas or accessories to parking areas may be considered a landscaped island.
(Ord. 98-38. Passed 7-6-98.)
   (g)    Approval of Parking Plans. Detailed drawings of off-street parking
facilities shall be submitted to the Planning and Design Commission for review
and approval in accordance with all the provisions of this chapter before a
building permit or certificate of occupancy may be issued. Such drawings shall
show the number of spaces and locations, dimensions and descriptions of all
features as set forth in this chapter.
   (h)    Required off-street parking facilities, including access driveways,
accessory to an existing use, and those required as accessory to a use created
or a building constructed or altered hereafter, shall be continued and
maintained in operation, and shall not be reduced below the requirements during
the period that the main use is maintained. In the event any such senior
citizen development should cease to be occupied by at least seventy-five
percent (75%) of persons sixty-two years of age or older, the off-street
parking requirements would be at the rate of two spaces per dwelling unit.
Failure by the owner or owners to supply such off-street parking shall cause
the Building Commissioner to revoke the occupancy of a sufficient number of the
dwelling units or seating capacity in order to bring the facility into
conformity with parking requirements. Accessory off-street parking facilities
shall not be used for the rebuilding, overhauling or dismantling of any vehicle
as defined in Section
301.51 or for the storage of motor or body parts. Accessory off-street parking
facilities may be used for minor repair services on passenger vehicles of an
occupant or tenant only. Permitted minor repair services shall be completed
within forty-eight hours; otherwise such repairs shall be performed within a
permitted building.
   (i)    Areas used to provide required off-street parking, and accessways
thereto, shall be illuminated whenever deemed necessary by the Planning and
Design Commission to protect the public safety. Lighting fixtures shall be so
designed and located so as not to reflect direct rays of light upon adjoining
residential properties, occupants of the buildings and streets or cause a glare
hazardous to pedestrians or drivers of motor vehicles on adjacent public
streets, and shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.
(Ord. 84-99. Passed 12-16-85.)
1139.20 SEWER SURVEY AND APPROVAL OF CITY ENGINEER REQUIRED.
   The City Engineer shall make a survey of the public sanitary and storm sewer
to be affected by the proposed building or use set forth in the application for
a building permit and shall forward his approval to the Building Commission
prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(Ord. 95-72. Passed 10-16-95.)
1139.21 DEVELOPMENT PLANS CRITERIA.
   (a)    A senior citizen housing development should be designed specially for
this purpose, incorporating all necessary safety and convenience features. In
general, the site amenities provided should be more attractive than for multi-
family projects since the elderly spend nearly all their time on the site. The
yards and passive recreation areas should be extensive in quantity and fully
landscaped. There should be a composition of small, intimate, private yard and
court areas for a variety of passive activities.
   (b)    Safety shall be emphasized both in scope and design. In addition to
the requirements of the Building Code, each development shall be fully
sprinklered and each building shall be provided with wet standpipes having a
diameter of six inches. Each building shall have an unencumbered access to a
public right of way. Vehicular circulation drives shall only be at the
perimeter of the project; subject to the requirements of Section
1139.10, parking areas may penetrate into the perimeter of the site. Abrupt
grades shall be avoided, all changes in grades in the walk system shall be
accomplished by ramps; there shall be not more than two exterior steps to any
building used by occupants. All buildings, two or more stories measured from
the main entrance, shall be served by at least two elevators, the minimum size
being five feet by seven feet each and equipped with heat-sensing devices.
   (c)    Electric and telephone service wires shall be underground between
point of service and the building. Each building shall have a public easement
for underground improvements such as sewer and water.
   (d)    When developed as an ancillary use, the multi-purpose senior center
shall be centrally located within the development.
(Ord. 81-19. Passed 5-4-81.)
   (e)   When required side and rear yards border a one- and two-family
residential district or any other zoning district with an existing residence
thereon, a landscape buffer shall be provided and maintained in a manner
approved by the Planning and Design Commission.
(Ord. 95-72. Passed 10-16-95.)
1139.22 DEPOSIT FOR SURVEY OF PUBLIC SANITARY AND STORM SEWERS.
   A deposit by the applicant for a building permit shall be made with the
Finance Director in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) to cover
the cost and expense of such survey of public sanitary and storm sewers. The
cost and expense of such survey shall be paid by the City from such deposit.
(Ord. 85-65. Passed 9-3-85.)
1139.23 APPLICATION AND DESIGN OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)    Application for Providing Facilities. An application for a building
permit pertaining to constructing a building or parking facility or for a
certificate of occupancy for a change in use of land or a building shall
include a site plan drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing the proposed
design of the parking area to be provided in accordance with the space
requirement schedules that are a part of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Determination of Required Parking Facilities. The minimum number of
spaces required for accessory off-street parking shall be determined by
applying the measurements standards in Section
1139.19 , the standards for designing parking areas in subsection (c) hereof,
the schedule of accessory parking requirements for the various uses in Section
1139.19  and any other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (c)    Design Standards. The plan of the parking spaces of a parking area,
included with an application to construct a building or parking area, or change
in use, shall be designed, dimensioned and the number of spaces determined in
accordance with the standards for designing parking areas as may be adopted by
the Planning and Design Commission. Design standards for enclosed parking areas
and garages, shall be in accordance with other provisions of the Code. (Ord.
84-99. Passed 12-16-85.)
1139.24 REQUIRED TRASH AREAS.
   All senior citizen housing residential uses that provide trash and/or
garbage collection areas shall be enclosed on at least three sides by a solid
wall or fence of at least four feet in height if such area is not within an
enclosed building or structure. Provisions for adequate vehicular access to and
from such area or areas for collection of trash and/or garbage as determined by
the Planning and Design Commission shall be required.
(Ord. 84-99. Passed 12-16-85.)

determines that the general standards as set forth in Section
1153.06 do exist and provided that the Board further determines that the
proposed changes, additions and/or improvements shall upgrade the existing
nonconforming building or existing nonconforming use of building and, further,
make the resulting development more compatible to the district for which it is
zoned and more compatible to the adjacent and abutting uses.
   (b)    The provisions of this section shall apply only to the following
types of changes, additions or improvements:
      (1)    Enlargements of a nonconforming structure or of a structure
housing a nonconforming use by an addition attached physically to the original
structure to form an integral part thereof;
      (2)    Construction of a new separate main use building that is a
replacement for the existing nonconformity;
      (3)    Construction of a new separate use building that would be a
replacement for an existing nonconformity and that would be a permitted
accessory use in and/or for the existing nonconformity;
      (4)   Moving the nonconforming use from one existing building to another
existing building located on the same zoning lot.
   (c)    The provisions of this section, however, shall not be construed,
applied or interpreted to authorize or permit the Board to permit or authorize
a new nonconforming main or accessory use to be introduced nor to permit or
authorize the extension of the nonconforming use to an adjoining zoning lot.

1145.01 INTENT.
   Sign regulations, including provisions to control the type, design, size,
location, illumination and maintenance thereof, are established and shall be
strictly construed in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)    To promote and maintain attractive high value residential and
business districts by preventing the blighting influence of excessive signage;
   (b)    To provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
and advertising goods sold or services rendered in business districts by
relating the size, type and design of signs to the type and size of
establishments;
   (c)    To provide for appropriate signs for the identification of commercial
development;
   (d)    To control the design of signs so that their appearance shall be
aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings and an overall urban design
for the area;
   (e)    To eliminate any conflict between advertising (or identification)
signs and traffic control signs which would be hazardous to the safety of the
motoring or pedestrian public;
   (f)   To provide review procedures which enable the City to comprehensively
evaluate the appropriateness of the sign to the site, building and
surroundings;
   (g)   To provide for the control of temporary signs to avoid the blighting
influence of excessive and/or deteriorating temporary signage; and
   (h)   To prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this code.
   In establishing these purposes, the City has determined that signs which do
not comply with these regulations (type, size, location and limitation on the
number of signs) are a public nuisance and are a detriment to the general
health, safety and welfare of the community. Unregulated signs are unduly
distracting to motorists and pedestrians and reduce the effectiveness of signs
needed to direct the public.
(Ord. 03-37. Passed 11-3-03.)
1145.02 ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)    Signs shall be designed, erected, altered, reconstructed, moved and
maintained, in whole or in part, in accordance with the type, design, size,
location, illumination and other provisions set forth in this chapter.
   (b)    The construction, erection, safety, maintenance and painting of all
signs shall be in accordance with this chapter, Chapter
1159 the Design Review Guidelines and with the Building Code. The provisions of
this chapter shall not amend or in any way modify other codes, rules or
regulations governing traffic signs within the City or other signs erected by
or pursuant to public authority within the City.
   (c)    The display of official public notices and the flag, emblem or
insignia of an official governmental body shall not be affected by these
regulations. Nor shall signs used for safety purposes relative to the repair or
maintenance of streets, sidewalks or of utilities in the public right of way be
affected by the provisions of these regulations. Name and informational signs
containing emblems of service clubs, places of worship, civic organizations and
the like consolidated with a single frame placed on public property with the
permission of the Director of Public Service and Development are not subject to
these regulations provided such emblems do not exceed three square feet in
area, provided the frame does not exceed eight feet above finished grade and
further provided the sign is not illuminated. Also exempt from the provisions
of the chapter are standard signs approved by the Director which are required
to be erected by any law, code, rule or regulation in force and in effect
within the City. The provisions of this chapter shall not govern the display of
signs which are part of the original construction of a vending machine,
newspaper dispensing device or fuel pump.

(Ord. 03-37. Passed 11-3-03.)
1145.04 MEASUREMENT STANDARDS.
   The size of signs is regulated in this chapter by relating the gross area of
signs to the building or use of a lot, or to the size of the building unit to
which the sign is accessory.
   (a)    The gross area of signs for a building or use shall include all
permanent surfaces visible from a public way and shall be measured as follows:
      (1)    The area of the surface, or surfaces, of an opaque or translucent
panel used or intended for displaying a message within a single continuous
perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of such sign. However, such perimeter
shall not include any structural elements lying outside the sign limits which
are not an integral part of the information or visual attraction unless
otherwise provided herein; plus
      (2)    The area within the smallest rectangle enclosing a sign composed
of letters or characters which are individually attached to a building wall or
other structural element not designed as a panel such as where the background
wall is not changed, painted, or designed to form a distinct or contrasting
background surface in relation to the remaining wall surface; plus
      (3)    The area of permanent window and door signs.
   (b)    Whenever the gross area of the signs is related to the size of the
building or lot: the frontage of a building shall be the width in lineal feet
of the facade of the building, business, office or industrial unit which faces
the principal street, or the facade containing the main entrance of a business
office or industrial building. The frontage of a lot not occupied by a building
shall be the number of lineal feet the lot abuts on the principal street.
   (c)    Buildings or lots having frontage on a second street may be permitted
additional signs along such second street which shall, however, not exceed
twenty-five percent (25%) of the area of the signs permitted along the main
facade; however, any additional sign area allowed as a result hereof shall only
be used on the building facade facing the second street or on the portion of
the same lot on the second street. (Ord. 03-37. Passed 11-3-03.)
1145.05 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Signs, as permitted install use districts, shall be designed to be
compatible in character and style with regard to materials, color and size of
the building, other signs designed or located on the same building and other
signs on adjoining buildings in order to produce an overall unified effect, and
in accordance with the standards set forth in this section. Signs shall be
reviewed with respect to each of the provisions of this section and shall
require approval by the Planning and Design Commission except the signs listed
in Section
1145.07 (h).
   (a)    Continuity. Signs shall be considered in relationship to their
surrounding environment and, if seen in series, should have a continuity of
design.
   (b)    Style and Color. The style of a sign shall be generally consistent
throughout the particular building or block involved; the color of signs shall
be a component of the color of the building facade and the total number of
colors on any sign shall be limited to three. Company logos would be exempt but
shall be limited in size to twenty percent (20%) of sign. Black and white are
to be considered colors.
   (c)    Lettering. The lettering on a sign shall be large enough to be easily
read but not overly large or out of scale with the building upon which it is
placed. An excessive amount of information on signs, where visual clutter could
create a potential safety hazard to motorists or pedestrians, shall not be
permitted. All letters, figures, characters or representations in cut-out or
irregular form maintained in conjunction with, attached to or superimposed upon
any sign shall be safely and securely built or attached to the sign structure.
   (d)    Materials. Signs shall be fabricated on and out of materials which
are of good quality, good durability and complementary to the building of which
they are to become a part.
      (1)    When noncombustible outdoor signs or display structures are
required by this chapter, all parts including the supporting structure shall be
of noncombustible material; provided, however, that wood, approved plastic or
other material not more combustible than wood or approved plastic shall be
permitted for small ornamental moldings, cappings, nailing strips, individual
letters, symbols, figures, and insignia, and on the face of a sign, provided
that the aggregate area of such facing for any sign shall not exceed that
permitted by this chapter.
      (2)    All metal parts used in any sign or structure, supports and braces
shall be of corrosion-resistant material or shall be galvanized and/or painted
with corrosive-resistant paint at least once every two years. When existing
structures are used for new or remodeled sign installation, all remaining parts
shall be brought to new like condition and painted with rust and corrosion-
resistant paint. Existing sign supports are subject to the approval process of
this chapter being used in new or remodeled sign installation.
      (3)    Every permitted sign shall be securely attached to the building
walls, marquees or structures using suitable metal supports, metal anchors,
bolts, chains, stranded cables, steel rods or braces and the working stresses
of chains, cables and steel rods and their fastenings shall not exceed one-
quarter of their ultimate strengths.
      (4)    Wall signs attached to exterior walls of solid masonry or concrete
shall be safely and securely attached to same by metal anchors, bolts or lead
expansion anchors of not less than three-eighths inch in diameter and shall be
imbedded to manufacturer's required depth for device used.
         A.    No wooden blocks or anchorage with wood used in connection with
screws, nails, spikes or staples shall be considered proper anchorage.
         B.    Wall signs attached to wood walls may be supported by lag screws
of not less than one-fourth inch in diameter, but shall be of size and length
to support load involved.
   (e)    Structural Design. Any graphic, or other sign structure, marquee,
canopy, or awning as defined in this chapter, shall be designed and constructed
to withstand a wind pressure of not less than thirty pounds per square foot of
net surface area, allowing for wind from any direction, and shall be
constructed to withstand loads as required in the Building Code. Signs shall
not be attached to parapets. The construction, bracing, anchorage and support
of permanent signs shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Building
Code of the City and of this chapter. The roofs of all marquees shall be
properly guttered and drained.
   (f)   Vertical Clearance. The lowest member for all signs, unless otherwise
specifically provided in this chapter, shall not be less than eight feet above
the finished grade of a sidewalk or any pedestrian way; and if located over a
pavement used for vehicular traffic or within twenty-four inches of the
vertical projection of the edge of such pavement, the lowest member of the
signs shall be not less than twelve feet above the finished pavement.
   (g)    Relation to Traffic Devices. Signs shall not be erected so as to
obstruct sight lines along any public way, traffic control lights, street name
signs at intersections or street sight lines. Signs visible from the sight
lines along a street shall not contain an arrow or words such as "stop", "go",
"slow", etc. and the movement, content, coloring or manner of illumination
shall not resemble highway traffic signs or interfere with the sight lines of a
traffic signal.
   (h)    Other Safety Requirements. No sign shall be erected or placed so that
any part thereof, including cables, guys, braces, supports, etc., shall be
within a fifteen-foot distance of public utility electric conductors carrying
not more than 600 volts, and for conductors carrying more than 600 volts, not
within a distance of thirty feet of such conductors, except that this provision
shall not apply to electric conductors which serve the sign.
   (i)    Changeable Copy Signs. Any sign or any portion thereof where the
message or graphics is not permanently attached to the structure, framing or
background and may be periodically replaced or covered over, manually or by
electronic or mechanical devices is subject to the provisions of this chapter,
including the design standards of this section, the provisions for illumination
of signs in Section
1145.06 , and the provisions for applications for permits; approval in Section
1145.07 .
When reviewing the proposed sign, the Planning and Design Commission shall
consider and establish standards applicable for the changeable copy which shall
include, but are not limited to: determining the portion of the sign permitted
for changeable copy; determining the suitable materials and method for making
changes and the manner for fastening the new copy; and establishing the color
and design criteria. These standards shall be set forth in the sign permit and
shall apply for the life of the sign unless otherwise amended by the Commission
pursuant to Section
1145.07 . (Ord. 03-37. Passed 11-3-03.)
1145.06 ILLUMINATION OF SIGNS.
   (a)   Light sources to illuminate signs shall be shielded from all adjacent

cause glare hazardous to pedestrians or motorists or so as to cause reasonable
objection from adjacent residential districts and shall be, in any event,
concentrated on the area of the sign.
   (b)    Animated, blinking, flashing, fluttering, moving or outline
illumination shall not be permitted in any district except that a permit may be
granted for movement showing the date, the time and the temperature

building or use on a lot, or used other than to backlight silhouetted letters,
or used for the internal illumination of plastic faced signs or letters, shall
not be permitted. Strobe lights or incandescent lamps shall not be used on the
exterior surface of any sign so as to expose the face of the bulb, light or
lamp to any public street or adjacent property. Strings of lights are not
permitted. Neon tubing except as otherwise provided herein shall not be visible
to the eye and shall not be closer than one inch to the plastic face or letter
of any sign.
   (d)    The methods of illumination permitted are colored light, illuminated
surface colors, internal illumination (a light source concealed or contained
within the sign, and which becomes visible in darkness through a translucent
surface) and indirect illumination (a light source not seen directly), provided
that within residential areas or within 500 feet thereof only white shall be
permitted.
   (e)    Display signs illuminated by electricity, or equipped in any way with
electric devices or appliances, shall conform in wiring and appliances to the

applied in any manner which limits the authority or the ability of the
Commission to obtain any review or recommendation regarding any development
proposal before it from any person it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (f)    Modifications by the Planning and Design Commission. Where the

landscaping by location of buildings relative to adjacent buildings or site
features.

Zoning Code, the Planning and Design Commission may recommend and request
modifications to increase other standards to offset the request of the
applicant. If modifications made by either the Commission and those requested
by the applicant which are subsequently approved by the Commission, the
modifications shall be made a part of the development plans and indicated on
the revised plans. The applicant and/or his assigns shall be bound by such
modifications.
   (g)   Legal Interpretation Required. Whenever a development proposal
requires a legal interpretation, all necessary documents shall be submitted to
the Law Department of the City for its review. Such submission shall be made by
the secretary of the boards and commissions of the City, the Building
Commissioner or by the board or commission requesting such legal
interpretation. Such interpretation shall be furnished in a timely manner and
shall be considered by the board or commission requesting such interpretation
but shall not be considered as binding upon the requesting board or commission.
   (h)    Issuance of Building Permit. Upon receipt or all required
recommendations and approvals as required by all applicable codes of the City
and upon a determination that all drawings, specifications, and required
documents are in accordance and compliance with the final action of the
Planning and Design Commission, the Building Code, the Fire Prevention Code,
the Charter of the City, and all other applicable laws, ordinances and
resolutions of the City, and that the fee(s) required by Chapter 1307 have been
paid, the Building Commissioner shall issue a building permit as provided
herein.
   (i)   Application of Zoning Code Provisions. The provisions to the Planning
and Zoning Code in both its interpretation and its application shall be held to
be the minimum requirements necessary for the protection and promotion of the
public health, safety, peace and welfare and shall be liberally construed in
such manner so as to further and ensure the underlying purposes, objectives and
intent of the Zoning Code.
   (j)    Lapse of Approval. An approval or an approval with modifications of a
development proposal by the Planning and Design Commission shall not be
withdrawn or changed unless there is a change of circumstances, or unless such
withdrawal or change is made pursuant to the rules of the Commission, or if
after the expiration of one year, no substantial construction is done in
accordance with the plans for which such approval or approval with
modifications was given. Should any of the foregoing be the case, the approval
or approval with modifications of the development proposal shall be deemed null
and void and review and approval of the development pursuant to each and every
applicable provision of this section and the applicable provisions of the
Zoning Code shall be required prior to the commencement of construction.

conditions beyond the control of the owner or contractor or for other good and
sufficient cause. Failure to complete the work within the time initially fixed

building and industrial areas, and for coordinating the proposed development/
redevelopment with the surrounding neighborhood.
   (b)    Such Concept Plans shall be developed in accordance with the
objectives, intent and any applicable provisions of the Zoning Code. After such
plans are duly adopted, after public hearing, by the Planning and Design
Commission, and approved by Council, any new construction, additions to or
alterations of, or rebuilding of such a business, commercial, office building
and industrial area, or part thereof, and the proposed design shall be in
compliance with the Concept Plan for the area. Such plans may be modified
subject to the same requirements and procedure as initial adoption should
circumstance or condition so warrant.
   (c)    Such Plans when adopted or modified shall not adversely affect to any
substantial extent the use, enjoyment and value of nearby property,
particularly property in a residential district, whether developed or not;
shall result in the least possible burden of City services and facilities and
the highest possible return to the City from tax revenues; shall provide for
the economic and other advantages that result from planned and coordinated
development; and shall be consistent with the improvement and enhancement of
the predominantly residential character of the City; all of which are essential

of the City, its residents and its commerce.
(Ord. 84-61. Passed 1-7-85; Ord. 95-74. Passed 10-16-95.)
1149.10 BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN CRITERIA.
   In addition to the provisions of Section
1149.05, the Planning and Design Commission shall review proposed developments
in accordance with the following provisions so as to encourage the benefits of
good community appearance:
(Ord. 95-74. Passed 10-16-95.)
   (a)   Basis for Review.
      (1)    The quality of the design of buildings and the relation of
buildings to each other and to open space interact and affect both the
environment and neighborhood values. The value and usefulness of each parcel of
land is vitally affected by the use and design of buildings and land and
generally affects the values of the entire community.
      (2)    New developments, if not properly related, may impair the
appearance and value of both improved and unimproved real property and may
prevent the most appropriate development of land and may cause attendant
depreciation of community values. A degree of conformity of use and appearance
stabilizes and assures the value of land and the welfare of the entire
community. Each new development, therefore, should be designed to be beneficial
and enhance the use of each development.
   (b)    Building Design Criteria. 
      (1)    An underlying architectural character should prevail throughout
each neighborhood and area. There should be some repetition of basic elements
through harmony of color, materials and a common scale. Each individual
building should express its function; moreover, it should have an identity,
individual character and variety in the overall design.
      (2)   It may be found that the proposed design is incompatible and
inappropriate in relation to other existing buildings or buildings for which a
permit has been applied for or issued in respect to significant design features
such as disharmonious compositions, color or texture of exterior wall and roof
materials or quality of architectural design. While there should always be
creative variety in the placement, size or bulk of buildings in each
neighborhood, there should, however, also be an underlying unity or design.
   (c)    Environment Design Criteria. 
      (1)    All new buildings and developments shall be brought together into
an orderly arrangement with the landscape and nature, other buildings, open
areas and surroundings. This should not result in uniformity of style or
subordination to existing buildings, except where the overall composition needs
a dominant feature. There should be a harmonious transition from the proposed
building to adjacent buildings and open space; also a transition in scale
between diverse uses at the boundaries.
      (2)    Not only the present, but also desirable future designs and
surroundings should be considered in the composition of new buildings.
Possibilities of making gradual improvements to the appearance of existing
parts of the community should always be considered.
         (Ord. 84-62. Passed 1-7-85.)
1149.11 CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   The Planning and Design Commission, with approval of Council, may grant
conditional use permits only for specific uses established in this Zoning Code.
In granting a conditional use permit, the Commission shall make a determination
based on information presented that the conditional use shall conform to the
intent of the Code, and meet the conditions and safeguards established in this
Code. To approve a conditional use permit, the Commission shall find:
   (a)    The proposed use is specifically listed in the zoning district
regulations;
   (b)    The proposed use shall be properly located in relation to land use,
pedestrian circulation and street plans of the City;
   (c)    The location, extent, intensity and layout of the proposed use shall
be such that its operations are not objectionable to adjoining and abutting
residences by reason of the emission of dust, gas, smoke, noise, fumes, odors,
vibrations, glare or other objectionable features greater than normal or as
permitted in the applicable zoning district;
   (d)    The location, design and operation of the proposed use at the
specific location would not discourage or interfere with appropriate
development or impair the full utilization of the surrounding uses and
properties;
   (e)    The proposed use meets the specific development conditions as
specified in the district regulations which permit such use; and
   (f)    The proposed use shall form a harmonious part of the district in
which it is to be located, taking into account, among other considerations,
convenience of access, relationship of use, and hours of operation and
concentration of vehicles which shall not be more hazardous or dangerous than
the normal traffic of the district. (Ord. 86-22. Passed 4-4-88.)
1149.12 REVOCATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   A conditional use permit shall become null and void if construction of the
proposed use has not begun within one year after approval by the Planning and
Design Commission and Council. The Commission with approval of Council may
revoke a conditional use permit upon finding that the use does not comply with
the Zoning Code or the conditions specified therein. Upon revocation of a
conditional use permit, all buildings and uses shall conform to the standards
and requirements of permitted main and accessory uses established for the
zoning district.
(Ord. 86-22. Passed 4-4-88.)
1149.13 CHILD DAY CARE SERVICE IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Child day care service" means the service of a provider in
administering to the needs of infants, toddlers, preschool children and school
children outside of school hours, by persons other than their parents or
guardians, custodians, or relatives by blood, marriage or adoption for any part
of a twenty-four hour day in the permanent residence of the provider, which
service is provided for a remuneration or other consideration for infants,

(Ord. 67-17. Passed 5-15-67.)
1153.05 RECORD OF DECISIONS.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall provide a detailed
report of all its proceedings, setting forth its reasons for decisions, which
shall include a specific finding on each of the standards set forth in Section
1153.06 as they apply in each specific case as a prerequisite for the granting
of a variance, modification or exception; the vote of each member participating
therein; and the absence of a member or his failure to vote. Such a record,
immediately following the Board's decision, shall be filed in the office of the
Building Commissioner and a copy thereof filed with the Clerk of Council. Such
a record is a public record and shall be available for inspection during the
normal business hours of the Division of Building.
   (b)    Special conditions that may be prescribed by the Board in its
decisions shall be incorporated by the Building Commissioner on any building

(Ord. 80-77. Passed 12-1-80.)
1153.06 STANDARDS FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the power to vary the
application of any provisions of this Zoning Code in terms of the following
standards so that public health, safety, morals and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice done:
   (a)    Where the literal application of the provisions of the Zoning Code
would result in unnecessary hardships. Hardships which are unavoidable if the
purpose and intent of the Zoning Code are to be realized, such as a theoretical
loss or limiting possibilities of economic advantage, are general hardships,
not unnecessary hardships. Likewise, an unnecessary hardship cannot be based on
conditions created by the owner. It shall be found that there are peculiar and
special hardships applicable to the property involved which are separate and
distinct from any general hardship prevailing in the use district; or
   (b)    Where unusual or exceptional circumstances or conditions (practical
difficulty) inhere in and apply only to the property involved or sought to be
built upon or used, and do not apply to other property within the same use
district. The mere fact that the owner of one parcel might apply prior to the
owners of other parcels in the same area would not give the owner a right to a
variance and thus grant a special privilege to an individual, when such
variance would be necessarily denied to others. It must be found, on the other
hand, that there are unusual or exceptional circumstances or conditions
(practical difficulty) justifying a variance on one lot, such as topographical
or geological conditions, and that a variance would be justified on any lot
where the same circumstances prevail; and
   (c)    Where granting of a variance will not be injurious to the property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located or be
detrimental to the public welfare. The mere existence of an unnecessary
hardship or of an unusual or exceptional circumstance or condition (practical
difficulty) is not ipso facto a basis for granting a variance. The existence of
such hardships or of unusual or exceptional circumstances or conditions
(practical difficulty) shall be balanced against the present conditions and
extent to which such a variance would interfere with the proper development and
rights of nearby property; and
   (d)    The granting of a variance will not be contrary to the purpose,
intent and objectives of the Zoning Code and the Plan of the City. A variance
merely permits that which is contemplated in the Zoning Code, and particularly
in this chapter, for unnecessary hardships and for unusual or exceptional
circumstances or conditions (practical difficulty). On the other hand, that
which was not contemplated in the Zoning Code, and particularly this chapter,
although deemed desirable, shall be effected by ordinance amendments or Zone
Map changes.
      (Ord. 94-88. Passed 12-5-94.)
1153.07 LAPSE OF VARIANCES.
   A variance once granted shall not be withdrawn or changed unless there is a
change of circumstances, or if, after the expiration of one year, no
substantial construction is done in accordance with the plans for which such
variance was granted. Should the latter be the case, the variance shall be
deemed null and void, and all regulations governing such premises in question
shall revert to those in effect before the variance was granted.
(Ord. 67-17. Passed 5-15-67.)
1153.08 APPLICATION AND STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS.
   A variance or exception from the terms of the Zoning or Building Code shall
not be granted by the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals unless and until a
written application for a variance or for an exception is submitted to the
Board. Such application shall be on a form adopted by the Board and shall
contain:
   (a)   Name, address and phone number of the applicant(s).
   (b)   Owner of the land, property or building in question. Written consent
of the owner shall be provided if the applicant(s) is not the owner.
   (c)   Description of the property.
   (d)   Description of the nature of the variance or exception requested.
   (e)   A written narrative statement submitted by the applicant demonstrating
and substantiating that the applicable conditions for the granting of variances
as set forth in Section
1153.06  exist or that the standards for the granting of exceptions exist.
   (f)   Such other information as may be required by the rules of the Board.
   The Board shall make a finding on the applicable standards for the granting
of variances as set forth in Section
1153.06  or on the applicable standards for the granting of exceptions as they
apply in each specific case as a prerequisite for the granting of the variance
or exception.

1159.02 EXPLANATION OF TERMS.
   For the purpose of this section, certain terms and words shall be
interpreted with regard to the following explanations:
   (a)    Appropriateness. A proposal is judged to be appropriate when it
respects the proposed architectural style of a building prescribed by this
chapter, and fits comfortably within its settings, neighborhood and overall
community. This condition also applies to landscaping and accessory structures.
   (b)    Compatibility. A design or a material/color selection is compatible
when it does not strongly deviate from its parent building, and the overall
desired character of the neighborhood as defined in this chapter. To be
compatible does not require look alike designs, but rather designs that reflect
some aspects of its parent building or buildings in the general vicinity
meeting the design guidelines, such as scale of windows, overhangs, building
materials, patterns of siding, roof slope. Conversely, incompatibility occurs
when an architectural design, landscape design or accessory building is
aesthetically harsh or overwhelming relative to its neighbors or is not within
the character of the neighborhood as defined in this section.
   (c)    Noncontributing. A factor in a proposal or part thereof that is taken
from an existing building characteristic or site feature such as design, scale,
fenestration, architectural feature, material or color that is determined by
the Planning and Design Commission to be not appropriate for replication in new
projects or modifications to existing projects when:
      (1)    It does not fall within the specific guidelines established by
this chapter;
      (2)    It does not enhance or improve the character of the City and/or
the surrounding environs of the project; or
      (3)    It is unrepresentative of the overall character of the City and/or
the prevalent character of the surrounding environs of the project.
   (d)    Proportion. The relationship of parts of a building, landscape,
structures, or buildings to each other and to the whole balance.
   (e)    Proximity. Proximity shall be considered in terms of the potential
for one property, by virtue of its location, to materially affect other
properties. In determining a property to be in proximity to another, the
following factors shall be considered:
      (1)    The visibility of both properties from a common point; or
      (2)    The location of both properties within a relatively compact
network of streets, walkways or spaces.
   (f)    Style. Style relates to a building's character and configuration in
plan and elevation. It also relates to architectural conventions of a
particular time period concerning details of windows and doors, eaves, corner
boards, pitch of roofs and the material of the building's skin.
   (g)   Visibility or Visible. The ability for any item or element to be seen
from an eye level of 70" above grade at any point on an adjacent public right
of way or an immediately adjacent property.
   (h)    Prototype. A building design for a franchise or similar business
venture which is intended for use or has been used at more than one location.
Any building design which is intended to reflect the details and elements of a
building or buildings typically used by a franchise or similar business
venture.
      (Ord. 02-43. Passed 12-2-02.)
1159.03 DESIGN REVIEW GUIDELINES.
   The design review guidelines cover all aspects of the exterior of a project
and include an examination of the surrounding context to ensure that new
development and modifications to existing developments achieve the objectives
of this chapter set forth herein. The following guidelines are in addition to
the specific regulations and requirements set forth for each of the particular
zoning districts.
   (a)    General Design Criteria. 
      (1)    The proposal shall enhance and improve the character of the
community and be appropriate and compatible with its surroundings in accordance
with the intent, objectives and development criteria of this chapter. In
assessing the characteristics of the surrounding area, noncontributing features
will not be considered factors in determining compatibility.
      (2)    The proposal should minimize changes to the natural grade, and
discourage the removal and destruction of trees, landscaping and other natural
features.
      (3)    Buildings shall be oriented in relation to proposed grading,
natural features and to existing structures on and adjacent to the site to
maintain:
         A.   Satisfactory proportions and scale;
         B.   Reasonable light and air; and
         C.   Privacy, as appropriate.
      (4)    Buildings, structures and landscaping should be designed and
located on the site and be of a scale to complement adjacent buildings and
enhance the character of the surrounding area by having features that are
appropriate and compatible with existing buildings and structures (where the
existing buildings and structures meet the intent of this section). In making
this determination the Planning and Design Commission shall consider:
         A.   Building height, width and general proportions;
         B.   Architectural features, including patterns of windows and doors,
roof pitch, cornice lines, balconies, porches, shutters, dormers, eaves and
other decorative detail;
         C.   General site characteristics which encourage well-landscaped and
conveniently located parking areas, safe and comfortable pedestrian ways, and
convenient pedestrian movement among adjacent and nearby buildings and parking
areas; and
         D.   Color use which is not bright or brilliant.
         E.   Building setbacks located at or near the front sidewalk line.
      (5)    Each individual building should express its function, and have an
individual character and identity created through functional variety in the
overall design. When existing buildings are to be renovated, the distinguishing
qualities or characters of a property that contributes to the overall character
should not be destroyed. Removal or alteration of distinctive architectural
features should be avoided, except for features that are determined to be
noncontributing features.
      (6)    Unique and contemporary designs may be appropriate to the extent
such design does not clearly detract from any architectural unity of an
ensemble or group of architecturally significant buildings.
      (7)    Landscaping shall be designed to:
         A.   Maintain an adequate and appropriate proportion of deciduous and
non-deciduous trees.
         B.   Be in such location, scale and amount to be integrated with the
building design.
         C.   Clearly designate entrances/exits.
         D.   Reasonably screen paved areas from the street enough through the
use of mounding, the land's natural topography, and/or adequate vegetation.
         E.   Include provisions for adequate irrigation and maintenance of
areas over 200 square feet.
      (8)    Mechanical and electrical equipment, waste receptacles and other
similar appurtenant or accessory structures shall be located to minimize the
impact on the building and the community:
         A.   Air-conditioning units, condenser elements, antennas, other
mechanical equipment, and waste receptacles should not be visible.
         B.   Ground mounted mechanical and electrical equipment and waste
receptacles must be screened with a fence or plant material as approved by the
Planning and Design Commission, or housed in a structure that is in harmony
with the surroundings.
         C.   Mechanical equipment attached to the side or roof of a building
and cannot be located on the roof or ground, including vents and intakes,
should be kept as low as possible and screened, or be compatible with the
background.
   (b)    Supplemental Design Criteria Applicable to Districts as Defined in
Schedule
1159.01(a).
(1) Site design. 
         A.   Park benches, ornamental planters and brick pavers should be
encouraged when appropriate to create inviting, people-oriented spaces.
         B.   Other devices may be considered appropriate in the interest of
adding attractive features to the district, such as a clock tower, flag poles,
a raised roof on an otherwise flat-roofed structure, a turret or penthouse.
         C.   Sidewalks connecting building entrances with parking areas and to
the public sidewalks shall be provided to permit and encourage pedestrian
access to the buildings.
         D.   Parking areas, drives and approaches shall be of appropriate size
and scale in relation to the appearance of the proposed development from the
right-of-way, adjacent property and the internal portion of the site itself.
Such appropriate scale shall be achieved by the width of approaches and drives,
by having adequate but not excessive parking, and by using landscaping within
parking areas of 6,000 square feet or more.
         E.   Accessory loading areas should be located in unobtrusive areas
and be screened from public view.

the overall design and appropriate for the size and scale of proposed
structures; harmonious with other architectural detail and ornamentation.
         B.   In areas which have a predominate architectural style, including
historic styles, such character should be a significant consideration in
determining compatibility. In such cases compatibility is partially achieved by
some repetition of basic elements such as color, materials and common scale.
         C.   Variations in the height of structures are encouraged in order to
impact some variety to the skyline of the area and to add some distinction to
the streetscape.
         D.   All visible sides of new construction should achieve
architectural interest and excellence.

is attached or is associated, and should not be in stark contrast to the
materials used on adjacent structures.
         B.   The texture, color, and placement patterns of materials shall be
appropriate for the size and scale of the proposed structures and be compatible
with the character of the area.
         C.   The following colors and materials shall be acceptable. Examples
of such contributing materials include:
            1.    Brick exterior.
            2.    Masonry units, split or ground face not exceeding 10% of the
facade for trim.
            3.    Natural stone.

merit as a variation, but will be very carefully considered in contrast to
adjacent materials.
            7.    Fencing and screening materials matching the building of
brick or stone masonry, painted aluminum, vinyl coated aluminum or vinyl,
wrought iron, or permanent evergreen landscape material.
            8.    Fabric awnings of colors as approved by the Planning and
Design Commission.
            9.    Material colors as approved by the Planning and Design
Commission.
         D.   Conversely, the following materials are not consistent with the
City's desired architectural characteristics and would tend to hasten the
creation of nuisances and/or blight; therefore, they are considered
inappropriate:
            1.    Mirrored/reflective glass unless used as a small component of
the building, designed and located within the context of the architectural
style, usually not exceeding 10% of the facade.
            2.    Concrete block or painted concrete block.
            3.    Stucco (exterior insulation and finish systems) or similar
large expanse of material unless it is utilized with belt courses, joints,
contrasting materials, exposed structural elements, or similar design features

block, painted concrete block, exterior insulated finishes, and metal siding.
            5.    Bright or primary colors, and/or awnings that are in stark
contrast to other structures in the surrounding area and/or design of the
proposed structure.
            6.    Fencing or screening materials of painted or unfinished wood,
chain link.

         A.   Building prototypes shall be discouraged unless specific
modifications have been made to a prototype design to bring it into compliance
with these design guidelines.
         B.   Building facades should have windows in order to insure a
comfortable visual dialogue between occupant and pedestrian. Large portions of
building facades without windows shall be discouraged.
         C.   The proportion of wall surface to openings should be consistent
with adjacent structures.
         D.   The use of fabric awnings, mainly confined to the street level,

   (d)    Supplemental Design Criteria Applicable to Districts as Defined in
Schedule
1159.01(a).
      (1)    Site design. 
         A.   The design, scale and location on the site of residential
structures, accessory buildings and landscaping should enhance the overall
natural character of the City.
         B.   Accessory structures and features such as garages, parking areas,
fences, walls, and landscaping should:
            1.    Ensure that the relationship to the dwelling reinforces the
dwelling as the major focal point of the site.
            2.    Ensure that the size, location and design are appropriate for
the size of the site and adjacent buildings.
         C.   Sidewalks should be enhanced with appropriate materials,
landscaping, lighting and benches.
      (2)    Building style and scale.
         A.   Architectural forms and the open spaces around them should be
integrated so as to enhance the quality of the outdoor public areas including
such factors as sunlight, weather protection, noise and air quality,
landscaping and benches.
          B.   All elevations of new construction are expected to feature some
door or window openings or other architectural feature to avoid blank walls and
such openings should have a pattern that is compatible with the character of
the neighborhood.
         C.   Buildings should have varying rooflines and facade modulation to
help reduce the apparent size of new buildings and give them more visual
interest. The use of pitched roofs is favored in order to add height and body
to the low level skyline.
      (3)    Materials and colors.
         A.   Within a contiguous development proposal there shall be a
continuity of building materials among all buildings.
         B.   Conventional building materials including wood, shingle, stone
and face brick, should be employed in new work, to the extent appropriate.
         C.   New products which simulate wood siding and slate roof tile or
shingles may be acceptable, but only with the presentation of full scale
samples in appropriate colors.
         D.   The following materials are discouraged: Mirrored/reflective
glass.
      (4)    Garages.
         A.   Garages are to be located so as to not dominate the street
elevation.
         B.   A garage should match the residence to which it is attached or
related with similar materials, roof pitch, colors, window styles, eaves and
trim.

1313.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted and amended by the Ohio Board of Building
Standards, Department of Commerce, and as published in Division 4101:1 et seq.
of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
(Ord. 11-44. Passed 11-21-11.)
1313.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)

removal and demolition of every building or structure or any appurtenances
connected or attached to such buildings or structures. As provided in Section
3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no plans or specifications shall be
approved or inspection approval given unless the building represented by those
plans or specifications would, if constructed, repaired, erected or equipped
according to those plans or specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791
of the Ohio Revised Code and any rules adopted by the Board.

agent and the person doing the work.
      (5)   Include notice of the procedure for appeal and right to a hearing
if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the order. The order shall
also indicate that, at the hearing, the owner may be represented by counsel,

examine witnesses appearing for or against the owner.
      (6)   Any hearing(s) scheduled for accessibility issues shall cause the
Building Official or the appeals board to notify a local advocate organization

dangerous to human life, shall be deemed a serious hazard. Where a building is
found to be a serious hazard, such hazard shall be eliminated or the building
shall be vacated, and where such building, when vacated, remains a serious
hazard, it shall be razed.
   (b)   Orders, Injunction Proceedings. Where the Building Official finds that
a building is a serious hazard and the owner of such building fails, in the
time specified in an order from the Building Official, to eliminate such
hazard, or to vacate or raze the building, the building official shall proceed
under Ohio R.C. 3781.15.
   (c)   Restoration. Where the structure or equipment is determined to be
unsafe by the Building Official, it is permitted to be restored to a safe
condition. To the extent that repairs, alterations or additions are intended to
be made or a change of occupancy occurs during the restoration of the
structure, such repairs, alterations, additions or change of occupancy shall
comply with Chapter 1 and 34 of the Ohio Building Code and this chapter.
(OBC 109)
1313.08 CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality may
make further and additional regulations, not in conflict with Ohio R.C.

material, system, assembly or product of a manufacturing process, or method or
manner of construction or installation shall constitute approval for their use
anywhere in Ohio.
   (c)   Other Rules. As provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 3781.11, the
rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

described is in accordance with the requirements of this Ohio Building Code,
and shall issue plan approvals for the construction, erection, alteration,
demolition and moving of buildings and structures.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders. The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance
with Section
1313.06  to ensure compliance with the Ohio Building Code.
   (e)   Inspections.
      (1)   If the plans for the erection, construction, repair, alteration,
relocating, or equipment of a building are subject to inspection by the
Building Official, under Section 108 of the Ohio Building Code, the Building
Official shall cause to be made such inspections, investigations, and
determinations as are necessary to determine whether or not the work which has
been performed and the installations which have been made are in conformity
with the approved construction documents.
      (2)   Special inspections are as required under Section 1704 of the Ohio
Building Code.
   (f)   Department Records. The Building Official shall keep official records
of applications received, certificate of plan approvals issued, notices and
orders issued, certificates of occupancy, and other such records required by
the rules of the Board of Building Standards. Such information shall be
retained in the official permanent record for each project. One set of approved
construction documents shall be retained by the Building Official for a period
of not less than one hundred eighty days from date of completion of the
permitted work, or as required by document retention regulations.
   (g)   Liability. Liability of certified Building Department personnel for
any tortious act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2744.
1313.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter or any Code adopted herein or
fails to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months or both. Each day
during which noncompliance or a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense. The Municipality may institute injunction proceedings in Common Pleas

1317.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter certain terms are defined as follows:
   (a)    "Natural grade" means the elevation of the undisturbed natural
surface of the ground.
   (b)   "Finished grade" means the elevation of the finished surface, in its
slope in reference to the horizontal plane of the ground adjoining any
structure, including rear yard grades.
      (Ord. 64-24. Passed 3-2-64.)
   
1317.02 ESTABLISHED ELEVATIONS TO BE GRADE.
   When a lot or plot is graded, the established elevations of the street,
curb, sidewalk or alley, whichever prevails, shall become the finished grade at
that line.
(Ord. 64-24. Passed 3-2-64.)
1317.03 WHEN RETAINING WALLS REQUIRED.
   When a lot or plot is graded to a higher or lower finished grade level than
the natural grade, which is surface of the ground prior to excavation, filling
or grading, or after a lot or plot is graded, it is a higher or lower finished
grade level than the natural grade or finished grade, on an adjoining property,
the owners or developers of such lot or plot shall provide suitable retaining
walls or other approved protection on his property to protect the adjacent
property from caving of earth and as required to maintain the existing natural
grade or finished grade of such adjacent property. (Ord. 81-31. Passed 5-4-81.)
1317.04 HARD-SURFACED LOT; CATCH BASINS.
   Whenever the surface of a lot or plot is excavated, filled, graded or hard-
surfaced with impervious material, positive drainage shall be provided so that
a nuisance will not be created. Catch basins properly connected to storm sewers
or other approved provisions, such as under-drains, shall be made where water
may pocket, to preclude the accumulation of surface water. Surface water shall

the description of the property on which such work was done. Such amount paid
for such work and the description of such property shall be certified to the
County Auditor, and shall be entered upon the tax duplicate, become a lien upon
such lands from the date of entry, and shall be collected as other taxes and
returned to the City with the General Fund.

flow from the splashed downspout is causing damage or a nuisance to the
complainants property. The City Engineer shall view the property and if he
determines that complainants property is being damaged by or a nuisance is
being created by the splashed downspout, the direction of flow from the
downspouts shall be redirected to avoid such damage or nuisance or be connected
to the storm sewer.

1333.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Fairview Park, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Fairview Park has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Fairview Park as identified in Section
1333.01 (f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Fairview Park.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Fairview Park as required by Section
1333.04 (c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 20777 Lorain Road, Fairview Park, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Fairview Park, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)    Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 10-23.
Passed 10-4-10.)

      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:   Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Fairview Park
Flood Insurance Rate Map, February 4, 1993, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:   Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:   The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:   Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 10-23. Passed 10-4-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Fairview Park flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1333.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section 
1333.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1333.03 (j)(1) prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1333.03 (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Fairview Park, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/ Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Fairview Park have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Fairview Park Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Fairview Park boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of Fairview Park suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Fairview Park has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1333.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.    
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (6)   Manufactured homes shall be affixed to a permanent foundation and
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of
over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
      (7)   Repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure, shall
be exempt from the development standards of Section
1333.04 (d).
      (8)   In AO Zones, new construction and substantial improvement shall
have adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters
around and away from the structure.
   (e)   Nonresidential Structures.  
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial or other nonresidential structure shall meet the requirements of
Section 
1333.04 (d) (1-3) and (4-8).

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section 
1333.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Fairview Park and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.  
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1333.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bank-full flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Fairview Park specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1333.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 10-23. Passed 10-4-10.)
1333.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Fairview Park Board of Zoning and Building Appeals is
hereby appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as
established by City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 20777 Lorain Road, Fairview Park, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1333.05 (d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 15 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1333.05 (d)(2) items A.-K. have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 10-23. Passed 10-4-
10.)

adhere to the following planning and best management practices as specified in
the most current edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual, where
applicable:
      (1)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices.      
         A.   Sediment control practices shall be functional throughout all
phases of up slope soil disturbing activities.
         B.   Settling facilities, perimeter controls, and other practices
intended to trap sediment shall be implemented as the first step of grading
within seven (7) days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to
function until the up slope development area is permanently re-stabilized.
      (2)   Clearing and Grubbing: Clearing and grubbing will be done in two
(2) more phases. The first phase will include only those locations necessary to
install the perimeter soil erosion and sediment control, and storm water
control practices. After the perimeter controls are in place and functioning,
the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing may continue.
      (3)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas & Soil Stockpile: Permanent or
temporary soil stabilization shall be applied as described in the tables below.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, uniformly covers
seventy percent (70%) or more of the soil surface, provides adequate cover, and
is mature enough to control soil erosion and to survive adverse weather
conditions.

approved sediment barrier. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity of that sediment barrier.
      (6)   Storm Sewer Protection: All storm sewer inlets that receive water
runoff from the development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden
water will not enter the storm sewer. In areas where construction will be
ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection shall be maintained
until all up-slope areas reach final stabilization, as determined by the
Community Engineer. The owner shall be required to hydraulically clean the
storm sewers after each of this period to the satisfaction of the Community
Engineer. Sediment from the soil disturbing activities shall be removed from
the system and shall not be flushed downstream. In situations deemed necessary
to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare the Public Service Director,
or his designee, may order the temporary removal of such storm sewer
protection. It shall be restored when so ordered, at no additional expense to
the Municipality.
      (7)   Working Near or Crossing Water Resources:
         A.   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources and their
setback areas. If construction vehicles must cross a drainage way repeatedly
during construction, an approved temporary stream crossing shall be

other instability, as determined by the Cuyahoga County Soil Survey, shall not
be graded, excavated, filled, or have loads imposed upon them, unless the work
is done in accordance with a qualified professional engineer’s recommendation
to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems caused by the soil
characteristics.
      (10)   Cut and Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions, and slope stabilization.
      (11)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed
or modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the
expected velocity of flow from a post-development, ten-year (minimum) frequency
storm without eroding.
      (12)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary erosion and
sediment controls practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion.
      (13)   Control of Non-Sediment Pollution: Site Management practices shall
be implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community’s water resources. These practices shall include
but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the proper
disposal of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall,
grout, or gypsum.
         B.   The washing of concrete material into a street, catch basin, or
other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washout shall be made available.
         C.   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage
area. A functional dike, or other approved containment, shall be constructed
around this storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of
the largest container in the storage area and any additional requirements
stipulated by the local Fire Authority.
         D.   Any toxic or hazardous waste shall be disposed of properly.
         E.   Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoffs from contaminated sites shall not be discharged from the
site. Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites.

is planned, to remain active through the winter months, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the owner, and the developer, engineer,
and contractor of the project with the Community prior to October 1, in order
to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment control as defined in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
      (15)   Maintenance: All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment
control practices shall be:
         A.   Designed and constructed to minimize maintenance requirements.
They shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance
of their intended function. The person or entity responsible for the continued
physical and financial maintenance of permanent erosion control measures shall
be identified to the satisfaction of the Community.
         B.   Inspected by the owner or person responsible for the development
area once every seven (7) days and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5” or
greater rainfall event. A written log of these inspections and any subsequent
improvements to controls shall be kept by the Owner or the Owner’ designated
representative. The inspections shall include the date of the inspection, the
name of the inspector, weather conditions, the actions taken to correct
problems, and the date actions were taken.

reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended function and that
another, more appropriate control practice is required, the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan must be amended by the person or entity responsible
for maintenance and the new control practice must be installed after receiving
approval from the City Engineer. If an inspection reveals that a planned
control practice is not needed, the person or entity responsible for
installation must request approval from the City Engineer to no longer
implement the planned control practice.
   (l)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water pollution prevention easements for each project shall be submitted

1337.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The intent of this regulation is to establish consistent technically
feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm
water management that will minimize damage to public and private property and
degradation of water resources, and will promote and maintain the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Fairview Park.
   (b)   This regulation further intends, but is not limited, to:
      (1)   Assure that property owners control the volume and rate of storm
water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and ground
water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential is not
increased.
      (2)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the site and minimize the need to construct, repair, and
replace enclosed, storm drain systems.
      (3)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
ground recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources,
wetlands and wells.
      (4)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (5)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetland, and storm water
management practices that are the result of inadequate storm water management.
      (6)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (7)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including, flood control, erosion control, and require
water quality protection; and encourage such practices that promote recreation
and habitat preservation.
      (8)   Ensure that all storm water management practices are properly
designed, constructed, and maintained.
   (c)   This regulation applies to, and requires a Storm Water Quantity
Management Plan (SWQM Plan) for earth disturbing activity on a parcel or
combination of parcels which results in 5,000 square feet or more of land
disturbance for parcels used or being developed, either wholly or partially,
for new or relocated projects involving highways and roads; subdivisions or
larger common plans of development, commercial, institutional, or residential
projects; building activities on farms; redevelopment activities; grading and
all other uses that are not specifically exempted. The regulation shall apply

(e.g. pipeline or utility line installation), which do not result in the
installation of increased impervious surface and are independent of other
construction projects (not part of a larger common plan of development or
sale). However, linear construction projects must be designed to minimize the
number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance.
   (d)   SWQM Plans are not required for the following activities:

ultimate use of the site and to function safely and with minimal maintenance.
      (2)   Proposed redevelopment project designs shall include storm water
quantity management practices that are designed to result in a reduction of the
rate of storm water runoff from the site.
         A.   “Redevelopment” refers to alterations of a property that change
the footprint of a site or building which results in greater than 5,000 square
feet of land disturbance except for parcels of land less than one acre used for
single family residential purposes only.
      (3)   All storm water quantity management practices shall have easements
sufficient to provide access to the Community for municipal purposes. The
following conditions shall apply to all easements:
         A.   Easements and covenants for subdivisions shall be approved by the
Community prior to approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the
County Recorder and on all property deeds. Maintenance responsibilities for
such practices shall be clearly stated on the record plat.
         B.   Unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer, access
easements to all storm water management practices shall be no less than 20 feet
wide. The easement shall also incorporate the entire storm water management
practice, plus an additional 15-wide band around the perimeter of the storm
water management practice.
         C.   Unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer, storm water
management practices in subdivisions, including basins, ponds, and wetlands,
shall be on separate lots held and maintained by an entity capable of long term
maintenance responsibility.
         D.   Those lots crossed by an easement are restricted against the
planting within said easement of trees, shrubbery, or other woody growth;
against the construction therein of buildings, fences (unless approved by the
City), walls, and other structures that may obstruct the free flow of storm
water and the passage of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and against the
changing of final grade from that described by the final grading plan approved
by the Community.
         E.   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to
allow maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each
facility, as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
      (4)   When developing a Storm Water Quantity Management Plan, storm water
management practices shall be used to control storm water quantity. In meeting
this requirement, the following shall apply:
         A.   Storm water management practices shall be designed in accordance
with the most recent version of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual, as
specified within this regulation, and/or in accordance with specifications
provided by the Community Engineer.

management practices shall demonstrate the following:
         A.   The peak rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the development drainage area does not exceed 75%
of the peak rate of runoff from a one (1) year frequency, twenty-four (24) hour
storm occurring on the same area under pre-development conditions.
         B.   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than
the Critical Storm, up to the 100-year storm, have peak runoff rates no greater
than 75% of the peak runoff rates from equivalent storms under pre-development
conditions. Consideration of the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 – year storms in
design and construction will be considered meeting this standard.
         C.   In the case of redevelopment, the Community may stipulate
additional criteria regarding discharge rates with respect to existing storm
water problems in down-stream areas.
      (6)   The Critical Storm for a specific development drainage area shall
be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, by appropriate hydrologic methods, the total volume of
runoff from a one-(1) year frequency, 24-hour storm occurring on the
development drainage area before and after development.
         B.   From the volume determined in (a), determine the percent increase
in runoff volume due to development.
         C.   Using the percentage increase determined in (b), select the 24-
hour Critical Storm from the following table:
If the Percentage of Increase                The Critical Storm for Peak Rate
in Volume of Runoff is                       Control will be:
Equal to or Greater Than:     And Less Than:

representative of the local county SWCD and other technical experts as
necessary.
   (d)   Preservation of Riparian Setback Areas: Except as otherwise provided
in this regulation, Riparian Setbacks shall be preserved in their natural
state, except that non-conforming structures and non-conforming uses existing
at the time of passage of this regulation may be continued in their existing
state as determined in the non-conforming structures or uses in riparian
setback areas section of these regulations.
   (e)   If an applicant has received legal authorization under applicable
state and federal laws to fill a wetland/stream or relocate a stream, then the
setback requirements shall not apply to those portions of the wetland/stream
that have been filled or relocated.
   (f)   An applicant shall be responsible for delineating the Riparian
Setback, and identifying this setback on all subdivisions, land development
plans, and/or building permit applications. This delineation shall be done at
the time of application of the preliminary plans, or all plans that are
required, or at the time of submission of any permit applications. This
delineation may be done by a metes and bounds, or higher level survey and shall
be subject to the review and approval of the City.
   (g)   No approval or permits for projects that involve soil disturbing or
land clearing activities shall be issued by the City prior to delineation of
the Riparian Setback in conformance with these regulations.
   (h)_   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, the Riparian Setback shall be
clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by the
applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout the
soil-disturbing or land clearing activities. The delineated area shall be
maintained in an undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these
regulations. All fencing shall be removed when a development project is
completed.
   (i)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision/property/parcel split, land
development, or other improvement, the Riparian Setback shall be permanently

Category 2 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (b)   Wetland Setback Averaging: The City may allow modifications of the
standard Riparian Setback width for wetlands on a case-by-case basis by
averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a
Qualified Wetland Professional demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City
that:
      (1)   It will not reduce wetland functions or functional performance;
      (2)   The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing
physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils,
or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and
would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;
      (3)   The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no
less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and
      (4)   The buffer width is not reduced to less than 75% of the standard
width.
         (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.10 PROCEDURES FOR WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps, and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map, and the Cuyahoga County Wetlands Inventory (if
applicable). A photocopy of the applicable section of each map will be attached
to the permit application.
      (2)   If a potential wetland is shown on any of the maps or if there is
reason for the Community to believe that an unmapped wetland exists on or
within 120 feet of the project site the applicant will retain a qualified
wetland professional to evaluate the proposed project site for wetlands or
wetland buffer areas. If no wetland buffer areas are found, the applicant shall
submit a letter from the qualified wetland professional with the preliminary
plat or permit application verifying his or her negative findings.
   (b)   New residential or commercial or other type development and projects
involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change: Upon filing a
request for approval of a preliminary plat or building permit for new
residential, commercial or other type of development that involves changes in
any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant or his or her
designated representative shall retain a qualified wetland professional to
survey the proposed development site for wetlands. If no wetlands are found,
the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit a letter
with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying that a qualified
wetland professional has surveyed the site and found no wetlands. The City may
waive the requirement to perform a survey if the applicant demonstrates to the
City’s satisfaction that no wetlands are within 120 feet of the project site.
   (c)   If the wetlands are found during either of the reviews set forth
above, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   A qualified wetland professional acceptable to the City of Fairview
Park, shall determine the presence of Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or
current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on the proposed development site
using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland
evaluation approved at the time of application of this regulation. Acceptance
of this determination shall be subject to approval by the City of Fairview Park
Engineer.
      (2)   If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on the proposed development site, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the
wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or his or
her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property subdivision/property/parcel split plans,
land development plans, and/or permit applications submitted to the Community.
         A.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
Community, using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
         B.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and bounds,
or higher level, survey subject to approval by the Community.
      (3)   Prior to any soil or vegetation disturbing activity, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate wetland setbacks on the
development site in such a way that they can be clearly viewed, and such
delineation shall be maintained throughout construction.
      (4)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Community prior to
delineation of wetland setbacks in conformance with this regulation.
   (d)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivision/property/parcel
split, commercial development or other land development or improvement,
riparian and wetland setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records
for the community and shall be maintained as open space thereafter through a
permanent conservation easement. A third party, not the landowner or permittee
or the Community, which is allowed by state law, shall be given the
conservation easement. If no third party will accept the conservation easement,
the Community shall accept it and protect it in perpetuity.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.11 MITIGATION FOR IMPACTS TO RIPARIAN AREAS AND WETLAND SETBACK AREA.
   (a)   If an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer that intrusion within the delineated Riparian Setback boundary is
necessary to accomplish the purposes of a project, then the applicant must
provide mitigation for that impact. The applicant shall develop a plan for
mitigation and submit it to the City Engineer for review and approval. For a
plan to be approvable it must meet the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   Mitigation for an impact will be required based on the location of
the intrusion. The closer the intrusion to the stream, the more mitigation will
be required. The Riparian Setback area for the stream corridor calculated in
accordance with the method specified in Section
1339.08 (a) shall be divided into two zones. Zone 1 extends from 0 to 25 feet
from the stream edge; Zone 2 extends from 25 feet to the outer edge of the
setback corridor. Intrusion into these zones will require the following
mitigation within the same Watershed Assessment Unit:
         A.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than four
times the total area disturbed in the stream and within Zone 1 of the site
being developed shall be mitigated within Zone 1 of the mitigation location. At
least a fourth of the mitigation area shall be mitigation in the form of stream
restoration in accordance with guidelines developed by the City of Fairview
Park. The remaining mitigation can be in the form of restoration or protection.
         B.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than three
times the area disturbed within Zone 2 of the site being developed shall be
mitigated within Zone 1 and/or 2 of the mitigation location.
      (2)   All mitigation shall, at a minimum include conserved or restored
setback zone, and should be designed to maximize the ecological function of the
mitigation. Including mitigation at the stream edge along with associated
setback areas is one way to maximize ecological function. The applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the mitigation
provided will have equivalent or greater ecological value than the riparian
area impacted by the project. Mitigation shall be protected in same manner as
existing Riparian Setback areas under this ordinance.
   (b)   If an applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer that intrusion within the delineated wetland setback is necessary to
accomplish the purposes of a project, then the applicant must provide
mitigation for that impact. The applicant shall develop a plan for mitigation
and submit it to the City Engineer for review and approval. For a plan to be
approvable it must meet the following minimum requirements:
      (1)   Mitigation for an impact will be required based on the location of
the intrusion, the closer the intrusion to the wetland, the more mitigation
that will be required. The Wetland Setback area for a wetland is calculated in
accordance with the method specified in Section
1339.09(a) shall be divided into two zones. Zone 1 extends from 0 to 25 feet
from the wetland edge and Zone 2 extends from 25 feet to the outer edge of the
setback area. Intrusion into these zones will require the following mitigation
within the same Watershed Assessment Unit:
         A.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than four
times the total area disturbed within Zone 1 of the site being developed.
         B.   An applicant shall provide mitigation equal or greater than two
times the area disturbed within Zone 2 of the site being developed.
      (2)   The mitigation may include buffer zone or wetland restoration or
enhancement. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer that the mitigation provided will have equivalent or greater
ecological value than the riparian area impacted by the project. Mitigation
shall be protected in same manner as existing Wetland Setback areas under this
chapter. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.12 USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   By-Rights Uses Without A Permit: The following uses are permitted by
right within the Riparian and Wetland Setbacks without prior approval, provided
they are not prohibited by any other applicable law. Open space uses that are
passive in character shall be permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks,
including, but not limited to, those listed in these regulations. No use
permitted under these regulations shall be construed as allowing public
trespass on privately held lands.
      (1)   Recreational Activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
federal, state, and local laws, such as hiking, fishing, hunting, picnicking,
and similar uses. Structures associated with recreation activity, including
limited boardwalks, pathways constructed of pervious material, picnic tables,
and wildlife viewing areas are permitted.
      (2)   Removal of Damaged or Diseased Trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
have to be removed. Because of potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs and branches resulting from the removal of damaged or diseased trees that
are greater than 6 inches in diameter, shall be anchored to the shore or
removed from the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or Reforestation. Riparian and wetland setbacks
may be revegetated with non-invasive plant species.
      (4)   Maintenance of lawns, gardens and landscaping. Lawns, gardens and
landscaping, that existed at the time this ordinance was passed, may be
maintained as long as they are not increased in size.
      (5)   Removal of deposited flood debris. The accumulation of flood debris
within a channel can exacerbate potential flooding problems. The City reserves
the right to, at any time, enter a stream area to remove deposited flood
debris. Care shall be taken to ensure that the disturbance to the riparian
setback is minimized during these events.
      (6)   Placement of stormwater retention or detention facilities. Storm
water facilities may be allowed within the Riparian Setback or Wetland Setback,
if:
         A.   Storm water quality treatment that is consistent with current
state standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The storm water quality treatment is located at least 50 feet
from the ordinary high water mark of the stream or the delineated wetland.
   (b)   By-Right Uses With A Permit. The following uses are permitted within
the Riparian and Wetland Setbacks with prior approval of the design by the City
of Fairview Park Engineer, provided they are not prohibited by any other
applicable law:
      (1)   Selective Harvesting of Timber. Selective harvesting of timber may
be allowed upon presentation of a Forest Management and Harvest Plan prepared
by a Qualified Forester and accepted by the City Official.
         A.   Any landowner harvesting timber for sale shall post a one
thousand dollars ($1,000) performance guarantee with the Community. This
performance guarantee shall be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account,
Certified Check or Cash, and it shall be held until completion of the timber-
harvesting operation.
         B.   Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or to block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs or branches resulting from permitted selective harvesting that are greater
than six inches in diameter at the cut end and shall be cut into sections no
longer than six feet or removed from the 100-year floodplain. Harvested trees
or felled logs and branches that are part of a designed and approved Streambank
Stabilization and Erosion Control Measure shall be allowed to remain in a
designated watercourse.
         C.   The Forest Management and Harvest Plan must:
            1.   Show that the site will be adequately stocked after the
approved selective harvest. “Adequately stocked” shall be defined as the
residual stocking level greater than the B- Level on the Allegheny Hardwood
Stocking Guide produced by the United States Forest Service, or other United
States Forest Service stocking guides as dictated by the forest community to be
harvested.
            2.   Show that trees located less than 25 feet from the ordinary
water mark will not be impacted by the proposed harvesting.
            3.   Include a map of the site. This map shall specify the location
of any skid and haul roads required for transporting harvested trees and fire
wood from riparian wetland setbacks.
            4.   Include the method to be used to transport harvested trees
from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            5.   Specify the erosion control Best Management Practices that
will be employed during and after the proposed harvest. These erosion control
practices shall be in conformance with the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Forestry’s BMPs for Erosion Control on Logging Jobs in
Ohio.
            6.   Provide the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA
Wetland and Stream protection permit numbers and the associated permit
requirements.
      (2)   Streambank Stabilization and Erosion Control Measures. Streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures may be allowed provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical. The streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon the
approval of a Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the Community.
      (3)   Crossings. Crossings of designated watercourses and through
riparian setbacks by publicly and privately owned roads, drives, sewer and/or
water lines and public and private utility transmission lines shall only be
allowed upon approval of a Crossing plan by the City Official. Such crossings
shall minimize disturbance in riparian setbacks stream substrate and shall
mitigate any necessary disturbances. Soil erosive materials will not be used in
making stream crossings. Such crossings must also comply with applicable state
and federal law, including U.S. Army Corps of Engineer and/or Ohio EPA permits,
if such permits are required.
      (4)   Construction of Fencing. Construction of fencing shall be allowed
with the condition that reasonable efforts be taken to minimize the destruction
of existing vegetation, provided that the fence does not impede stream or flood
flow, and the disturbed area is replanted to the natural or preexisting
conditions before the addition of the fence, as approved by the City of
Fairview Park.
      (5)   Dredging. Dredging may be allowed to be performed for the potential
purpose of flood control. In order for the City to approve of dredging of an
open channel, a hydrologic/hydraulic engineering study must first be performed
and approved by the City Engineer; and that this study indicates that the
dredging of a particular stream will help minimize future flooding problems. In
addition, the dredging activity must be in accordance with all applicable state
and federal law.
         (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.13 USES PROHIBITED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLANDS SETBACKS.

without a permit issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers and/or the Ohio EPA.
   (d)   Motorized Vehicles.  There shall be no use of motorized vehicles,
except as permitted under the uses permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks
section of these regulations.
   (e)   Disturbance of Natural Vegetation. There shall be no disturbance,
including mowing, of the natural vegetation, except for such conservation
maintenance that the landowner deems necessary to control noxious weeds; for
such plantings as are consistent with this regulation; for such disturbances as
are approved under the uses permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks section
of these regulations; and for the passive enjoyment, access, and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
Nothing in this regulation shall be construed as requiring a landowner to plant
or undertake any other activities in riparian and wetland setbacks.
   (f)   Parking Lots. There shall be no parking lots or other human-made
impervious cover, except as permitted under the Uses permitted in riparian and
wetland setbacks section of these regulations.

      (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.14 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   A non-conforming use within a riparian and/or wetland setback which is
in existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not
otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the use
shall not be changed or enlarged unless it is changed to a use permitted under
these regulations, except as permitted in Section
1339.14(h). For example, the existing building footprint or roofline may not be
expanded or enlarged in such a way that would move the structure closer to the
stream or wetland.
   (b)   If damaged, destroyed or discontinued, a non-conforming structure or
use may be repaired or restored within two years from the date of damage/
destruction/discontinuation or the adoption of these regulations, whichever is
later, at the property owner’s risk. This section shall also not prohibit
ordinary repairs to a residence or residential accessory building that are not
in conflict with other provisions of this regulation.
   (c)   In the case of a non-conforming structure within a riparian or wetland
setback, the Community will allow a ten (10) foot maintenance access zone
measured perpendicular to the structure, to temporarily extend further into the
setback as long as disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized and
vegetation is restored to the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon
completion. If any soil disturbance in a wetland will occur as part of any such
maintenance activity, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the
Ohio EPA, as appropriate, must be submitted prior to the onset of the soil
disturbing activity.
   (d)   In the case of a non-conforming residential structure, the City
Official may allow minor upgrades to the structure that extend further into the
riparian setback, such as awnings and pervious decks/patios, provided the
modifications do not extend more than ten (10) feet further toward the stream
or wetland than the original foundation of the structure existing at the time
of passage of this regulation, and further provided that the modification will
not impair the function of the riparian zone nor destabilize any slope of
stream bank, as determined by the City of Fairview Park Engineer. Expansions
larger than (ten) 10 feet must be obtained through the variance process.
   (e)   In the case of existing dedicated City roadways within the riparian
setback, the City of Fairview Park reserves the right to enter into the
riparian setback to perform typical activities associated with the operation
and maintenance of roadways. These activities include, but are not limited to,
salt application during freezing temperatures, road and shoulder stabilization,
repair and/or replacement of existing guardrail, the construction of new
guardrail based upon safety concerns, and the widening of pavement or bike
paths, based upon traffic studies. The City shall ensure that disturbance to
existing vegetation is minimized, and vegetation is restored to the pre-
existing state, as near as practical, upon completion.
   (f)   In the case of existing hydraulic structures, such as storm conduits
and culverts, within the riparian setback, the City of Fairview Park reserves
the right to enter into the riparian setback to perform typical activities
associated with the operation and maintenance of these structures. These
activities include, but are not limited to, the inspection of structures,
maintenance and repair of structures, and the replacement of structures.
Additionally, if supported by a proper engineering study, the City reserves the
right to increase the size of any hydraulic structure within the riparian
setback, or add to the structure to improve the hydraulic function of the
structure, such as adding a headwall to a culvert. The City shall ensure that
disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized, and vegetation is restored to
the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon completion.
   (g)   In case of existing utilities within the riparian setback, the City of
Fairview Park reserves the right to grant permission to utility companies to
enter into the riparian setback to perform typical activities associated with
the inspection, maintenance, replacement, of any and all existing utilities
within the riparian setback. The utility company shall ensure that disturbance
to existing vegetation is minimized, and vegetation is restored to the pre-
existing state, as near as practical, upon completion.
   (h)   A residential structure or use within the setback existing at the time
of passage of these regulations may be expanded subject to the provisions of
the following subsections (h)(1) through (h)(5).
      (1)   The expansion conforms to existing zoning regulations.
      (2)   The expansion must not impact the stream channel or the 100-year
floodplain.
      (3)   The expansion must not exceed an area of fifteen percent (15%) of
the footprint of the existing structure or use that lies within the setback.
Expansions exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of the footprint within the setback
must be obtained through the variance process.
      (4)   The expansion is at the property owner’s own risk.
      (5)   Execution of a Chapter
1339 Release and Waiver form by the applicant.
   (i)   Non-residential structures or use expansions will be permitted only
through the variance process. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.15 VARIANCES WTH RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   Applications for variances to the provisions of this chapter shall be
submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance from this regulation
as provide herein. In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or
practical difficulty such as to justify the granting of a variance, the
Community shall consider the potential harm or reduction in stream and/or
wetland area functions that may be caused by a proposed structure use. The
Board of Zoning Appeals may consult with representatives from the Cuyahoga
SWCD; the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Area; the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; the Army Corps
of Engineers; the County of Cuyahoga Engineer; the Cuyahoga County Health
Department or other technical experts at the expense of the applicant as
necessary to consider variance requests.
   (c)   Requests for variances for subdivisions will be considered for the
following:
      (1)   An additional stream crossing or crossings for a subdivision or
open space development which is necessary for the health, welfare and safety of
the residents of the subdivision.
      (2)   A reduction of the setback width, no to exceed ten percent (10%) of
the prescribed setback width.
   (d)   No variances shall be granted for expansion of the following
structures or uses:
      (1)   Facilities which use, store, distribute or sell petroleum-based
products or any hazardous materials. Such facilities include, but are not
limited to: asphalt plants, dry cleaners, gasoline service stations and road
maintenance facilities.
      (2)   Facilities which use, store, distribute or sell products which may
contribute higher than acceptable concentrations of dissolved or particulate
matter to storm water runoff around the facility. Such facilities include, but
are not limited to: landfills or transfer stations, junk yards, recycling
facilities, quarries and borrow pits, sand and gravel extraction operations and
road salt storage barns.
   (e)   In reviewing whether to grant variances, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall consider the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. The determination shall be
based on sufficient technical and scientific evidence as provided by the
applicant and the agencies, at the applicant’s expense, listed herein.
      (2)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the Community’s flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance
when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setbacks before riparian and
wetland setbacks are varied.
      (4)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (5)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing
to the extent possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to
minimize soil erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (6)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the Community.
      (7)   A reduction in storm water infiltration into the soil in wetland
areas will occur.
      (8)   A requested above ground fence does not increase the existing area
of mowed grass or lawn.
      (9)   Modifying parking requirements before varying the riparian setback.
      (10)   Modifying building shape, size or design to avoid or minimize
intrusion into the riparian setback.
      (11)   In the case of a lot made unbuildable or to which no economically
viable use exists as a result of this regulation, consider the minimum variance
needed to make it buildable or restore economic viability for an appropriate
sized and compatibly designed structure, while following the guidance provided
in this section.
      (12)   Whether the variance will increase the likelihood for flood or
erosion damage to either the applicant’s property or to other properties.
Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in the riparian
and wetland setbacks in any situation where gravel or porous pavement will do
the job.
      (13)   Culverting of watercourses should be avoided.
      (14)   Whether the variance will result in the result in the need for
article slope or bank stabilization measures that could interfere with the
function of the riparian zone.
   (f)   Any variances to the provisions of this chapter which are granted
require the execution of a Chapter
1339 Variance Release and Waiver form by the applicant.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.16 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   When an applicant or his or her designated representative disputes the
boundary of a riparian or wetland setback or the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit
documentation to the Community which describes the boundary, the applicant’s
proposed boundary, and justification for the proposed boundary change.
   (b)   The Community shall evaluate this documentation and shall make a
written determination within a reasonable period of time, not exceeding sixty
(60) days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the applicant. If during this
evaluation the Community requires further information, it may be required of
the applicant. In the event that the Community requests such additional
information, the sixty (60) day limit on the Community’s review shall be
postponed until the applicant provides such information.
   (c)   Any party aggrieved by any wetland or riparian setback determination
under this regulation may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (d)   During the interpretation and appeals procedure, the City of Fairview
Park reserves the right to consult with any outside expert, as the City deems
necessary.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.17 INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK.
   The delineation of riparian and/or wetland setbacks shall be inspected by
the Community or its designee, as follows:

under the uses permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks section of these
regulations, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall
provide the Community with at least five (5) working days notice prior to
starting such activities.
   (c)   Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the Community that
uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to violate the
provisions of these regulations. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.18 VIOLATIONS.
   No person shall violate, or cause, or knowingly permit to be violated, any

any lands in violation of these regulations or in violation of any permit
granted under these regulations. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 3-3-08.)
1339.99 PENALTIES.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any provision of this
regulation is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined no
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned for no more than one
hundred eighty (180) days, or both, for each offense.

violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
   (c)   Upon notice from the City of Fairview Park Building Commissioner, or

regulation, such work shall immediately stop. Such notice shall be in writing
and shall be given to the owner or person responsible for the development are,
or person performing the work and shall state the conditions under which such
work may be resumed; provided, however, in instances where immediate action is
deemed necessary for public safety or the public interest, the City Official
may require that work be stopped upon verbal order pending issuance of the
written order.
   (d)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the community, by or through its Law Director and/or any of his or her
assistants, from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a Court of
Proper Jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development or to restrain, correct
or abate a violation, or to require compliance with the provisions of this

1343.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This Title Three shall be known as "the Exterior Property Maintenance Code"
of the City of Fairview Park, and may be referred to as "this Code".
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.02 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the City vacant land
and land with structures used for residential and nonresidential use which are,
or may become in the future, substandard with respect to structure and
maintenance, or further that such conditions including but not limited to
structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of exterior of
premises, existence of fire hazards, and unsanitary conditions, constitute a
menace to the health, safety, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens
and inhabitants of the City. It is further found and declared that by reason of
lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain properties have the
further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and that
if the same are not curtailed and removed, the conditions will grow and spread
and will necessitate in time the expenditure of large amounts of public funds
to correct and eliminate the same, and that by reason of timely regulations and
restrictions as herein contained the growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential
used and immediate neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and
welfare, protected and fostered.
(Ord. 05-12. Passed 4-18-05.)
1343.03 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code is to protect the
public health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing
the maintenance, appearance and conditions of all residential and
nonresidential premises; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners
and operators; to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of
residential and nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for the violations of
this Code; and to provide for the right of access across adjoining premises to
permit repairs. This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for
the public interest and it is intended that this Code be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.04 APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential and nonresidential building and the premises on which it
is situated in the City, used or intended to be used for dwelling, retail,
commercial, business, light manufacturing or industrial occupancy shall comply
with the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code, whether or not
such building was constructed, altered or repaired before or after the
enactment of this Code, and irrespective of any permits or licenses which were
issued for the use or occupancy of the building or for the installation or
repair of equipment or facilities prior to the effective date of this Code.
This Code establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued occupancy
and use of all such buildings and does not replace or modify standards
otherwise established for the construction, repair, alteration or use of the
building, except as provided in Section
1343.03. Where there is mixed occupancy, residential or nonresidential use
therein shall be nevertheless regulated by and subject to the provisions of
this Code.
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.05 CONFLICT OF LAW; GREATER STANDARD TO PREVAIL.
   In any case where the provisions of this Code impose a higher standard than
set forth in any other City ordinance or under State law, then the standards as
set forth herein shall prevail, but if the provisions of this Code impose a
lower standard than any other City ordinance or of State law, then the higher
standard contained in any such ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.06 CONDITION FOR ISSUANCE AND RENEWAL OF PERMITS AND LICENSES.
   After the date of enactment of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code, all
licenses and permits shall be issued upon compliance with this Code as well as
compliance with the ordinances under which such licenses and permits are
granted.
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.07 ENFORCEMENT OF AND COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this Exterior
Property Maintenance Code shall constitute a defense against any violation of
any other City ordinance applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any
provision herein relieve any owner, operator or occupant from complying with
any such other provision, nor any City official from enforcing any such other
provision.
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.08 RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER, OPERATOR AND OCCUPANT INDEPENDENT OF EACH
OTHER.
   (a)    Owners and operators shall have all the duties and responsibilities
as prescribed in this Exterior Property Maintenance Code and the regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto, and no owner or operator shall be relieved from
any such duty and responsibility nor be entitled to defend against any such
duty and responsibility nor be entitled to defend against any charge of
violation thereof by reason of the fact that the occupant is also responsible
therefor and in violation thereof.
   (b)    Unless expressly provided to the contrary, in this Code, the
respective obligations and responsibilities of the owner and operator on one
hand, and the occupant on the other, shall not be altered or affected by an
agreement or contract by and between any of the aforesaid or between them and
other parties.
(Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.09 EXISTING OFFENSES AND VIOLATIONS NOT DISCHARGED.
   The repeal of any provisions of any other ordinances by this Exterior
Property Maintenance Code shall not affect any action for prosecution or
abatement under any such ordinance or any notice, complaint or order issued by
any officer or agency of the City, prior to the effective date hereof or
concerning any prosecution or other steps of enforcement which have been taken
or are being taken with any administrative agency or in the Municipal Court for
enforcement thereof. (Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1343.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Fines for Violations. A violation of any section or subsection of
this Exterior Property Maintenance Code shall be punishable by a fine not to
exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each violation committed.
   (b)    Meaning of "Each Violation". Each violation of a section or
subsection of this Code shall constitute a separate and distinct violation
independent of any other section or subsection or any order issued pursuant to
this Code. Each day's failure to comply with any such section or subsection
shall constitute a separate violation.
   (c)    Application to Officers or Agents. Where the defendant is other than
a natural person or persons, subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall apply to any
agent, superintendent, officer, member or partner who alone or with others has
charge, care or control of the premises.
   (d)    Other Legal Action. The imposition of any penalty shall not preclude
the Director of Law from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a
court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful repair or maintenance; or
to restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to prevent the occupancy of a
building, structure or premises, or to require compliance with the provisions
of this Code, or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, or
the orders or determinations of the Property Maintenance Officer or the Zoning
Board of Appeals.

1345.01 ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Duties of Building Commissioner; Appointment of Property Maintenance
Officer.  All inspections, regulations, enforcement and hearings on violations
of the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code shall be under the
direction and supervision of the Building Commissioner. The Mayor shall appoint
a Property Maintenance Officer to perform such duties as may be necessary to
the enforcement of this Code, including the making of inspections. The Building
Commissioner may designate, subject to the approval of the Mayor, such other
public officials or employees of the City, to perform such duties as may be
necessary to assist the Property Maintenance Officer in the enforcement of this
Code, including the making of inspections. (Ord. 87-46. Passed 4-4-88.)
   (b)    When Inspections Are To Be Made.
      (1)    Residential. All buildings and premises subject to this Code are
subject to inspections from time to time by the enforcing officer of the City.
At the time of such inspections, all exterior parts of the premises shall be
available and accessible for such inspections, and the owner, operator and
occupant are required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such
inspections. Such inspections shall be made during regular open hours of the
business occupying the premises unless there is reason to believe a violation
exists of a character which is an immediate threat to health or safety
requiring inspection and abatement without delay.
   (c)    Conduct of Inspectors. Inspectors shall conduct themselves so as to
avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
   (d)    Where Access by Inspectors is Refused. 
      (1)    Penalty. Where the Property Maintenance Officer or his agent is
refused access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant or
operator from conducting an inspection of the premises, such person shall be in
violation of this Code and subject to the penalty in Section
1343.99 . 
      (2)    Search Warrant or Access Warrant. In addition to the provisions of
subsection (d)(1) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer may, upon affidavit,
apply to the Municipal Court for a search warrant setting the actual conditions
and circumstances that provide a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance
or violation of this Code exists on the premises and, if the Court is satisfied
as to the matter set forth in the affidavit, the Court may authorize the
issuance of a search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part
of the premises on which the nuisance or violation exists. Warrant for access
may be issued by the Court upon affidavit of the Property Maintenance Officer
establishing grounds therefor.
   (e)    Procedure Where Violation Discovered. Where a violation of this Code
or the regulations hereunder is found to exist, a written notice from the
Property Maintenance Officer shall be served on the person or persons
responsible for the correction thereof.
      (1)    Service of notice. Notice may be served personally or by prepaid
telegram or by mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address
of the person to be served. Where it is ascertained that the owner does not
reside on the premises, the last known address shall be the address of the
owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance
of the building. The Property Maintenance Officer shall file and provide notice
to any owner or operator of any violation at any address other than the last
know address provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the
Property Maintenance Officer personally or by certified mail addressed to the
Property Maintenance Officer. Date of service of the notice shall be determined
where service is by mail as of the day following the day of mailing for notices
to addresses within the City, and as of the fourth day after the day of mailing
for notices to addresses outside the City. Where the day of service would fall
upon a Sunday or other day when mail is not ordinarily delivered, then the day
of service shall be the next regular delivery day. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein contained, notice served upon the agent designated shall
constitute service upon the owner, operator and lessor of the premises, jointly
and severally. Where the owner, operator or lessor or the agent thereof cannot
be found at the address given, the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby
may be served by posting notice upon the premises in a conspicuous place near
as possible to the front entrance thereof. (Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
      (2)    Notice to become an order unless hearing before the Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals requested. Within twenty days of the date of
service of a notice, the notice shall constitute a final order unless any
person affected by the notice requests a hearing thereon before the Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals and serves a written request within the twenty-day
period in person or by mail on the Chairman of the Board. Such request for a
hearing before the Board shall set forth briefly the grounds or reasons on
which the request for a hearing is based and the factual matters contained in
the notice of violation which are to be disputed at the hearing. The Chairman
of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall within thirty days therefrom
and upon five days' notice to the party aggrieved, set the matter down for
hearing. (Ord. 05-12. Passed 4-18-05.)
      (3)    Determination at hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Chairman of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall be vested with all
the powers provided by law to compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in
interest by issuance and service of subpoena, to require by subpoena the
production of books, records or other documents at any such hearing which may
be pertinent to matters to be determined by him and to enforce any such
subpoena or secure any order for the enforcement of any such subpoena as
provided by law. Determination shall be made within ten days from the
completion of the hearing. The Board shall issue an order either incorporating
the determinations and directions contained in the notice, modifying the same
or withdraw the notice.
      (4)    Extension of time. The Property Maintenance Officer may extend the
time for correction or abatement of the violation for an additional period of
time not to exceed thirty days, except where major capital improvements or
renovations are involved, in which instance the time for completion may be
extended for a period not to exceed ninety days beyond the expiration date of
the original notice.
      (5)    Effect of noncompliance with notice. Whenever the owner, agent,
occupant or operator of a structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to
comply with any notice of the Property Maintenance Officer that becomes a final
order as provided in subsection (e)(2) hereof, the Property Maintenance Officer
may advise the Director of Law of the circumstances and request the Director to
institute an appropriate action at law to compel compliance.
      (6)    Referral of violations. Any violation of any ordinance other than

shall be reported to the official or agency responsible for the enforcement of
such ordinance.
      (7)    Where notice and hearing not required prior to court proceedings.
Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (e)(l) through (3) hereof,
violations of the following section may be prosecuted without notice by the
filing of a complaint by the Property Maintenance Officer in the Municipal
Court pursuant to Section
1345.01 (d).
      (8)    Effect of notice on owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this
Code, the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the owner is also the
operator, shall constitute notice of the violation set forth therein until such
violation is abated in conformity with this Code and the other applicable City
ordinances.
         (Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
1345.02 POWERS AND DUTIES OF PROPERTY MAINTENANCE OFFICER.
   (a)    Adoption of Rules and Regulations. The Property Maintenance Officer
is hereby authorized and empowered to promulgate such written rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the proper interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code,
provided that such rules and regulations do not conflict with this Code and
conform to the general standards prescribed by this Code. The Property
Maintenance Officer shall file copies of such rules and regulations with the
Clerk of Council, City Engineer, Fire Chief, the Building Committee of Council
and the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals and shall make available in the
Property Maintenance Officer's office a copy for inspection by members of the
public during regular business hours. Such rules and regulations shall have the
approval of the City Engineer and Fire Chief, respectively, where the
provisions thereof relate to matters which are also in the jurisdiction of and
supervision of each officer. In case of conflict, the rule or regulation may be
promulgated by direction of the Building Committee of Council. Such rules and
regulations shall have the same force and effect as the provisions of this
Code, and the violations thereof shall be enforced as violations of the express
provisions of this Code, as herein provided.
   (b)    Power to Vary or Modify Provisions of This Code. The Property
Maintenance Officer shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement of the
requirements of this Code upon written application by an owner, operator or
occupant, after making determination that:
      (1)    A.    Any variation or modification of structure or use approved
by the Property Maintenance Officer will not in any material way alter the
standards of this Code and cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety of
occupants or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of
adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.    Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the
premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to
health, safety or welfare that might be derived therefrom; or
      (2)    The owner or operator is without any practical or feasible means
to comply with the strict provisions of this Code, or
      (3)    A.    The strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would
require the installation or repairs and improvements estimated to exceed five
hundred dollars ($500.00) in cost; and
         B.    The premises subject to the Code are contemplated for
acquisition or are within an area where acquisition is contemplated by a public
agency having the power of eminent domain and there is a reasonable likelihood
that the premises will be acquired and razed or moved within a period of two
years. However, any waiver of the provisions of this Code shall be cancelled
and the Property Maintenance Officer shall strictly enforce the Code if it
shall be ascertained subsequent to the granting of the waiver that the premises
are in fact not to be acquired for any public use or purpose.
      (4)    Right to hearing where application denied. Upon denial of any such
application, the owner, operator or applicant may request a hearing which shall
be held in accordance with provisions of Section
1345.01 (e)(2).
      (5)    Application not to constitute a defense or stay. Such application
shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this Code concerning any
proceedings which are pending in the Municipal Court when the application is
filed nor shall any variance or modification allowed hereunder constitute a
vested right against any ordinance enacted hereinafter by Council compelling
strict enforcement of any provisions of this Code.
      (6)    Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations or
modifications are approved in any section of this Code by the Property
Maintenance Officer or by action of the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals or
of any court, a written record thereof stating the name of the applicant, the
address of the premises, the variation or modification approved, date of
approval and the reasons therefor, satisfying the provisions contained herein,
shall be prepared by the Property Maintenance Officer and filed both under the
section or sections of this Code to which the variation or modification applies
and under the address of the premises, and such files shall be available for
public inspection in the office of the Property Maintenance Officer during
regular business hours.
         (Ord. 70-11. Passed 3-16-70.)
   (c)    Semi-Annual Review of Code Provisions and Operations. The Property
Maintenance Officer shall semi-annually review the procedure and operation of
this Code, and report to Council on or before June 30 and December 31:
      (1)    Any recommended amendment, addition or modification or provisions
of this Code consonant with the field experience of the personnel charged with
enforcement;
      (2)    A summary of the enforcement experience indicating number of
violations abated, number of cases processed in the Municipal Court, number of
inspections made and such other and further pertinent information as will
provide Council with an account of progress in securing the standards required
by this Code;
      (3)    Any further recommendation as to how the Code and the procedure
and operations thereunder can be improved.

      (1)    "Evidence of vacancy" means any condition that on its own or
combined with other conditions present would lead a reasonable person to
believe the property is vacant, including but not limited to, significantly
below standard utility usage, overgrown or dead vegetation, accumulation of

of furnishings or personal items consistent with habitation or occupation, and
statements by governmental employees or neighboring owners that the property is
vacant.
      (2)    "Owner" means any and every person, entity, bank, or service
company, who alone or severally with others has legal or equitable title to any
dwelling, dwelling unit, building, structure, or parcel of land; or has care,
charge or control of any dwelling, dwelling unit, building, structure, or
parcel of land, in any capacity, including but not limited to, agent, executor,
administrator, trustee or guardian of the estate of the holder of legal title;
or is a mortgagee in possession of any such property; or is an agent, trustee,
receiver, or other person appointed by the courts and vested with possession or
control of any such property.
      (3)    "Person" means a natural person or any legal entity, including but
not limited to, a corporation, firm, partnership, limited liability company,
estate, trust or association.
      (4)    "Secured by other than normal means" means a building secured by
means other than those used in the design of the building.
      (5)    "Unoccupied" means building which is not being used for the
occupancy authorized by the owner.
      (6)    "Unsecured" means a building or portion of a building which is

            (7)    "Vacant building" means a building, excluding government-

                  B.    Unoccupied and secured by other than normal means; or
                  C.    Unoccupied and an unsafe building as determined by the
Building Commissioner; or
                  D.    Unoccupied and having utilities disconnected; or
                  E.    Unoccupied and has housing or building code violations;
or
                  F.    Illegally occupied, which shall include loitering and
vagrancy; or
                  G.    Unoccupied for a period of time over ninety (90) days
and having an existing code violation issued under the authority of the
Building Commissioner; or
                  H.    Unoccupied and abandoned by the property owner.
   (b)   The owner(s) of any dwelling structure that has become a vacant
building, as defined in Section
1358.01, shall, within sixty (60) days of becoming vacant according to that
Section, register with the Building Commissioner or his/her designee and
designate an authorized agent located in Cuyahoga County for each vacant
dwelling structure owned or under the control of the owner(s) as defined in
Section
1358.01(a)(2). The registration shall remain valid until December 31 of the
year of the date of issuance. The owner shall be required to annually renew the
registration by January 1 of each subsequent year for as long as the dwelling
structure remains vacant and shall pay an annual registration fee of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) for each registered dwelling structure. The owner
shall notify the Building Commissioner or his/her designee within twenty (20)
days of any change in the registration information by filing an amended or
designee registration statement on a form provided by the Building Commissioner
or his/her designee for such purposes.
      The registration statement shall include the name and address of the
designated agent and shall reflect the owner's and agent's express agreement to
appear in court when summoned, that the agent shall be authorized to testify on
behalf of the owner in such case, and that the agent's testimony shall be
deemed to be binding upon the owner in any administrative enforcement
proceeding, or court proceeding, instituted by the City against the owner or
owners of the dwelling structure. The failure of the owner of the vacant
dwelling structure to obtain a deed for the property or to file the deed with
the county recorder shall not excuse the owner from compliance with Section
1358.01. Registration under Section
1358.02 of the Codified Ordinances shall not negate the requirements for
registration under Section
 1358.01 or any other requirement of Chapter
1358.
  
      (c)    Inspections.
      (1)    The Building Commissioner may inspect or cause to be inspected any
premises in the City for the purpose of enforcing and assuring compliance with
the provisions of this section. The Building Commissioner shall request the
owner provide access to all interior portions of an unoccupied building in
order to permit a complete inspection; or otherwise the Building Commissioner
may inspect under the authority of a warrant.
            (2)    Vacant properties shall be externally inspected by the
Building Commissioner a minimum of twice per year to ensure compliance with
property maintenance codes.
   (d)   In addition to any other information required by the Building
Commissioner or his/her designee, such as a legal photo identification document
or card the registration statement shall include the name, street address and
telephone number of a natural person eighteen (18) years of age or older,
designated by the owner or owners as the agent authorized to receive, on behalf
of such owner or owners, notices of violations of City ordinances and for
receiving service of process, in any court proceeding or administrative
enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the property or the
dwelling structure, including but not limited to, notices and processes served
in connection with the enforcement of the Housing Code. The authorized agent
must maintain a physical office with a street address in Cuyahoga County, Ohio,
or must actually reside within Cuyahoga County, Ohio. A Post Office Box shall
not satisfy the physical office requirement. An owner who is a natural person
and who meets the requirements of this subsection as to location of residence
or office may designate himself as agent. By designating an authorized agent
under the provisions of this Chapter
1358, the owner consents and agrees to receive any and all notices of violation
of City ordinances and to receive process in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or dwelling structure, including but not limited to, proceedings
related to the enforcement of the Housing Code, by service of the notice or
process on said agent. The designation of an authorized agent under this
Section shall be deemed effective until the owner notifies the Building
Commissioner or his/her designee, in writing, of a change of authorized agent
or files a new annual registration statement.
     
   (e)   If a vacant dwelling structure is on property subject to a foreclosure
action, the plaintiff in the foreclosure action shall be required to comply
with the provisions of Chapter
1358 if at least one of the following apply:
            (1)    The plaintiff in the foreclosure action is a mortgagee of
the property; and/or
            (2)    The plaintiff in the foreclosure action has assumed
possession or control of the property.
     (f)   Any plaintiff in a foreclosure action required to comply with
Chapter
1358 pursuant to Section
1358.01(e) shall, in addition to satisfying all other requirements of this
Section, provide a cash bond to the Building Commissioner or his or her
designee, in the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), to secure the
continued maintenance of the property in compliance with the provisions of this
Housing Code throughout its vacancy and to reimburse the City for any fees owed
and expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, repairing and/ or making such
building safe by any legal means including, but not limited to, demolition.
This cash bond obligation shall apply throughout the property's vacancy. If the
inspection required in Section
1358.01(c) results in the identification of violations of the Codified
Ordinances the correction of which would cost more than fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000.00), then the City is authorized to require a higher bond,
based on the amount set in the report of such inspection. If the bond is
entirely depleted, the Plaintiff in the foreclosure action shall provide a
second bond for the greater of the cost of repairing the remaining, uncorrected
violations identified in the report of the inspection pursuant to Section
1358.01(c) or fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), whichever is greater. When
the title to the property has transferred, remaining bond funds will be
returned to the Plaintiff in the action if that Plaintiff submits a written
request for such refund within forty-five (45) days of the transfer of title;
otherwise, such funds shall be retained by the City.
   (g)   An annual administrative fee of one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00) or ten percent (10%) of the required bond, whichever is greater,
will be deducted from the bond by the City for administrative expenses
including, but not limited to, the processing, accounting, and other
administrative functions inherent in the administration of the foreclosure
bond. The fee shall be deducted at the beginning of each year and shall not be
prorated. These fees will be held in a separate fund. The fees are due from the
date the vacancy began. Except for the initial fee, the annual fee shall be due
on or before January 1 each calendar year.
      (h)    Penalty. Any responsible party who fails to comply with any
provision of this Section shall be subject to a one hundred dollar ($100.00)
per day administrative penalty with a maximum penalty of fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000.00) or shall be guilty of a first degree misdemeanor, or both.
Every day such violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (i)    In the event the City or one of its contractors, due to a lack of
response of an owner or agent, is required to take action to abate a nuisance
at a vacant property, the owner will be billed for the cost of abatement. If
the same is not paid within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice, the
amount due may be certified to the County Auditor for collection as other taxes
and assessments are collected in accordance with Ohio R.C. 731.54, or the
Director of Law is hereby authorized to seek the recovery of such costs by
civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the property owner.
If the property is subject to a foreclosure bond as set forth in Section
 1358.01 herein, said bond will be drawn upon to cover such costs.
(Ord. 21-62. Passed 10-18-21.)
1358.02 REGISTRATION OF DWELLING STRUCTURE BY OUT-OF-COUNTY OWNERS.
   (a)   If a dwelling structure located within the City is owned by a person
or persons, none of whom reside within Cuyahoga County, the owner(s) of the
dwelling structure, within thirty (30) days after the effective date of Section
1358.02 or within thirty (30) days after obtaining ownership of the dwelling
structure, whichever is later, and annually thereafter, shall register with the
Building Commissioner on a form prescribed by the Building Commissioner or his
or her designee and shall designate an authorized agent for each such dwelling
structure. The authorized agent must be a natural person eighteen (18) years of
age or older who maintains a physical office with a street address in Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, or who resides within Cuyahoga County. A Post Office Box shall
not satisfy the physical office requirement. By designating an authorized agent
under the provisions of Section
1358.02, the owner consents and agrees to receive any and all notices of
violation of City ordinances and to receive process in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or dwelling structure, including, but not limited to, proceedings
related to the enforcement of the Housing Code, by service of the notice or
process on said agent. The registration statement shall include the name and
address of the designated agent and shall reflect the owner's and agent's
express agreement to appear in court when summoned, that the agent shall be
authorized to testify on behalf of the owner in such case, and that the agent's
testimony shall be deemed to be binding upon the owner in any administrative
enforcement proceeding, or court proceeding, instituted by the City against the
owner or owners of the dwelling structure. The failure of the owner of the
dwelling structure to obtain a deed for the property or to file the deed with
the County Recorder shall not excuse the owner from compliance with Section
 1358.02.
   
   (b)    The designation of an authorized agent under this Section shall be
deemed effective until the owner notifies the Building Commissioner or his/her
designee, in writing, of a change of authorized agent or files a new annual
registration statement, or until the Building Commissioner is notified in
writing that such registration is no longer required because an owner of the
dwelling structure now resides in Cuyahoga County.
   
   (c)    A violation of Section
1358.02 is hereby classified as a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable
by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.oo), imprisonment not
more than six (6) months, or both. Every day such violation occurs or continues
shall constitute a separate offense. Nothing in this section shall limit the
court in fashioning a remedy other than those set forth herein that shall
maintain the building to prevent it from harming the neighborhood in which it
stands.
(Ord. 21-62. Passed 10-18-21.)

1361.08 PROTECTION OF TENANT AND PURCHASER; NOTICE OF CONVERSION AND PUBLIC
OFFERING STATEMENT.
   (a)    Notification to Prospective Tenants. Throughout so much of the 180
day period immediately before the filing of a declaration with the Cuyahoga
County Recorder pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5311 and subsequent to the
effective date thereof (October 1, 1978) during which a developer of a
conversion condominium development is the owner thereof, he shall give written
notification to each prospective tenant before entering into a lease that such
rental units may be converted to condominiums within such period.
   (b)    Notice of Conversion and Public Offering Statement. A developer of a
conversion condominium development shall deliver to each of the tenants in
possession written notice of his intention to convert to condominiums, which
shall include the statement in at least twenty point, bold type that the
tenant's suite shall be offered for sale to the public if not purchased by the
tenant, and the public offering statement not less than 120 days prior to its
offer for sale provided that in the case of any tenant who is over sixty years
of age, or who is deaf or blind or who is unable to walk without assistance,
the developer shall deliver such notice of conversion and the public offering
statement not less than 180 days prior to its offer for sale.
   (c)    Appropriate Notices. A developer of a conversion condominium
development shall deliver appropriate notices of conversion based upon his best
knowledge and information as to the age and/or health of each tenant. No tenant
who receives other than a 180 day notice of conversion shall be deemed to be
entitled to a 180 day notice unless within fifteen days of receipt of such
inappropriate notice the tenant delivers a written statement to the developer
declaring that the tenant is over sixty years of age or is deaf or blind or is
unable to walk without assistance, and in such case such statement shall be
presumed to be true in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
   (d)    Expiration of Tenancy Before End of Notice Period. Any tenant whose
tenancy expires other than for cause before the expiration of 120 days from the
date of delivery of such notice of conversion shall have the right to an
additional tenancy on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental
until the expiration of such 120 day period, by the giving of written notice
thereof by the tenant to the developer within thirty days of the date of
delivery of such notice of conversion, provided that in the case of any tenant
who is over sixty years of age, or who is deaf or blind or who is unable to
walk without assistance, such tenant shall have the right to an additional
tenancy on the same terms and conditions and for the same rental until the
expiration of such 180 day period, by the giving of written notice thereof by
the tenant to the developer within sixty days of the date of delivery of such
notice of conversion.
   (e)    Expiration of Tenancy After Ninety Days from Notice.
      (1)    Any tenant whose tenancy expires after ninety days from the date
of delivery of such notice of conversion shall have the right to terminate the
lease upon forty-five days written notice, without penalty or other termination
charge to the tenant. By delivering the notice of termination, the tenant
waives the right of first refusal under subsection (h) hereof.
      (2)    Subsection (e) (1) hereof shall not apply to tenants who have
received notification under this section before entering into a lease.
   (f)   Contents of Notice of Conversion. 
      (1)    The notice of conversion shall include a copy of the Fairview Park
Condominium Ordinance as an attachment.
      (2)    The notice of conversion shall contain a statement indicating that
such notice shall not be construed as abrogating any rights any tenant may have
under a valid existing written lease, including the statement that the tenant's
rental may not be increased.
      (3)    The notice of conversion shall contain a statement instructing the
tenant that he may advise the Building Department of any structural or
mechanical defects in the building or common areas, and of any unhealthful or
unsafe conditions therein which the tenant believes should be corrected.
       (4)    Failure of a developer to give notice of conversion as herein
required shall be a defense to an action for possession.
 
   (g)    Service of Notice of Conversion and Delivery of Public Offering
Statement.
       (1)    The notice of conversion and public offering statement shall be
deemed to be delivered on the third day after they are deposited in the United
States mail addressed to the tenant at his last known residence, which shall be
the address of the property subject to the lease, sent by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, with sufficient prepaid postage
affixed to carry it to its destination. A tenant's refusal to accept delivery
shall be deemed adequate service. If such mailing is returned to the developer
undelivered to the tenant for any reason other than refusal of the tenant to
accept delivery, the developer shall forthwith remail such mailing by regular
United States mail, and such remailing shall be deemed to be delivered on the
third day after it is deposited in the mail. Personnel delivery is permissible
if service cannot be made by United States mail.
      (2)    The public offering statement shall be filed with the City on the
same day that the notice of conversion and public offering statement are
deposited in the United States mail to tenants.
 
   (h)    Tenant's Right of First Refusal.
       (1)    During the period of ninety days following delivery of the notice
of conversion and public offering statement, and during the period of 120 days
following delivery of the notice of conversion and the public offering
statement in the case of any person who is over sixty years of age, or who is
deaf or blind or who is unable to walk without assistance, any person who was
both a tenant on the date of delivery of notice of conversion and the public
offering statement and also a current tenant shall have the exclusive right of
first refusal to purchase his unit and to enter into a contract for the
purchase of the tenant's suite and obtain financing.
       (2)    During such period, the developer may offer to sell such unit to
prospective purchasers other than the tenant at the price not less than offered
to the tenant and/or on terms not more favorable than offered to the tenant,
and each contract for sale of a unit shall conspicuously disclose the existence
of, and shall be subject to, such right of first refusal.
       (3)    If during such period the tenant fails to purchase the unit the
developer shall not offer to sell that unit during the following ninety days at
a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms
offered to the tenant without first making the same offer to the tenant, who
shall have ten days therefrom within which to accept the offer.
      (4)    Should a tenant reject the offer to purchase or decide to vacate
the tenant's suite, the unit shall be made available to other tenants in the
development. The tenant's right to purchase another unit in the development
shall extend to the end of the applicable right of first refusal purchase
period: provided that the tenants shall not have the right to purchase more
than one unit in the development. Whenever all tenants in the development have
indicated in writing their intention not to purchase a unit, the unit may be
sold to the public.
   (i)    Co-Tenant's Rights. 
      (1)    If there is more than one tenant leasing a unit, then each such
tenant shall be entitled to contract for the purchase of a proportionate share
of the unit and of a proportionate share of any tenant who elects not to
purchase.
      (2)    In no case shall this provision be deemed to authorize the
purchase of less than the entire interest in the unit to be conveyed.
   (j)    Tenant's Right to Cancel Contract.
      (1)    A tenant may, at his election, cancel an executed contract between
himself and the developer for the purchase of a condominium ownership interest
by delivering to the developer or his agent written notice of cancellation at
any time before midnight local time of the third day following the date the
contract is signed by the tenant, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)    Upon receipt of a timely cancellation, the developer shall
immediately refund any deposit, earnest money or other funds and the parties
shall have no further rights or liabilities under the contract. Each tenant's
contract for sale of a unit shall conspicuously disclose the tenant's right of
cancellation.
   (k)    Developer's Right of Access. 
      (1)    The tenant in a conversion condominium development shall not
unreasonably withhold consent to the developer to enter the unit in order to
inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, supply necessary or
agreed services or show the unit to purchaser.
      (2)    Except in case of emergency, or unless it is impracticable to do
so, the developer shall give the tenant reasonable notice of his intent to
enter and may enter only at reasonable times. Twenty-four hour notice is
presumed to be reasonable notice in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
      (3)    The developer shall not abuse the right of access or use it to
harass the tenant. Entry by the developer in excess of twice in any seven day
period for the purpose of showing the unit to purchasers shall be presumed to
be an abuse of the right of access in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
      (4)    The developer shall not undertake remodeling for conversion of a
unit which is occupied by a tenant, unless the tenant has decided to purchase
the unit or has granted permission to the developer. The developer shall not
create any unreasonable disruption of the common areas, including but not
limited to, restricting access thereto, not interfere with the quiet use and
enjoyment of the premises, nor abuse the right of access or use it to harass
the tenant.
      (5)    No conversion condominium unit shall be sold or offered for sale
if in the 180 day period immediately before the delivery of the notice of
conversion and the public offering statement or during the notice of conversion
period provided in subsection (b) hereof, any tenant has been evicted without
cause.
   (l)    Nonwaiverability of Obligations and Rights. Neither the obligations
nor the rights under this section may be waived in a contract of lease, a
contract of sale or otherwise and any attempted waiver is void.
   (m)    Delivery of Public Offering Statement to Purchasers Other Than
Tenants.
      (1)    The developer shall deliver a copy of the public offering
statement to a purchaser other than a tenant not less than fifteen days before
the execution of a contract for the purchase of a unit.
      (2)    On the day of delivery of the public offering statement, the
developer shall obtain a receipt signed by the purchaser acknowledging that he
has received the public offering statement and has also received a copy of such
receipt on that date. Such receipts shall be kept on file in the possession of
the developer for a period of two years from the date of delivery to and
signature by the purchaser and such receipts shall be subject to inspection by
the City at any reasonable time.
   (n)    Purchaser's Right to Cancel Contract.
      (1)    Unless a purchaser is given the public offering statement not less
than fifteen days before executing a contract for the purchase of a unit, the
purchaser may cancel the contract within fifteen days after first receiving the
public offering statement. The notice of cancellation by the purchaser shall be
in writing, and cancellation is to be without penalty. All payments which were
made by the purchaser before cancellation, including interest where applicable,
shall be refunded by the developer within three days after receiving notice of
cancellation.
      (2)    If the developer fails to provide a purchaser with a public
offering statement and all amendments thereto before conveying a unit, the
purchaser, in addition to any rights to damages or other relief, is entitled to
receive from the developer an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the sales
price of the unit as liquidated damages.
      (3)    The provisions of this subsection shall apply to tenants, in
addition to the tenant's right to cancel under subsection (j) hereof.
      (4)    Each purchaser's contract for the sale of a unit shall
conspicuously disclose the purchaser's right of cancellation.
      (5)    The purchaser's right to cancel under this section may not be
waived in the contract of sale or otherwise and any attempted waiver is void.
