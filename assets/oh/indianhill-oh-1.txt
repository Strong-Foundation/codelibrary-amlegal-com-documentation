otherwise prescribed in this Charter.
Section 4.2 Petition.  
The form, content, verification of and other requirements for initiative and
referendum petitions, except as otherwise prescribed in this Charter, shall be
controlled by the laws of Ohio including all statutes now or hereafter enacted.
The petition, together with such reasonable filing fee as may be established by
Council or under Ohio law, shall be filed with the City Manager or his or her
designee and transmitted to the Clerk. Within 10 days, the Clerk shall
determine whether the petition appears to be valid and sufficient according to
law. If the petition appears valid and sufficient, the Clerk shall present the
petition, together with a certificate as to his or her initial determination
and the proposed measure or ordinance, to the County Board of Elections. The
County Board of Elections will examine the signatures and return the petition
to the Clerk within the time set by the laws of Ohio, together with a statement
attesting to the number of voters who signed the petition. The Clerk shall
thereafter present the petition and a certificate of his or her final
determination that the petition is valid and sufficient to Council at its next
regular or special meeting. If at any point the petition is determined to be
invalid or insufficient, no further action shall be had.
Section 4.3 Initiative.
Each ordinance initiated by a petition and finally certified by the Clerk to be
valid and sufficient shall, upon presentation, be referred by Council to a
committee to hold a public hearing thereon and to report its recommendations at
the next regular meeting of Council. Council shall, not later than the second
regular meeting following such reference, either pass the ordinance in its
original form, or take such action as may be required to submit the ordinance
to a vote of the electors at the next general or primary election occurring
more than 90 days thereafter, or at a special election to be held on a date
fixed by Council by a vote of at least five members thereof. If an initiated
ordinance is approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall be
an ordinance of the Village, and shall take effect immediately unless another
date is specified therein. Any resolution proposed by initiative petition for
the purpose of terminating a contract for fire or police services shall be
submitted to a vote of the electors, without other action by Council than may
be required to ensure an election thereon as promptly as possible.
Section 4.4 Referendum.
The referendum shall not be applicable to: (1) ordinances or other measures
making or transferring appropriations; (2) ordinances or other measures
providing for the discharge of any obligation legally due from the Village; (3)
ordinances or other measures submitting any ordinance or measure to a vote of
the electors; (4) ordinances or measures directing the performance of any
official duty or providing for investigations or reports; (5) ordinances or
other measures not having the force or effect of law; (6) repealing measures
passed by Council pursuant to referendum petitions; (7) ordinances or other
measures subsequent to the first ordinance or measure when a series of
legislative steps are required to accomplish the particular purpose or
objective of said first ordinance or measure; or (8) emergency ordinances or
measures passed by Council pursuant to Section 3.2 of this Charter. The taking
effect of all other ordinances and measures shall be postponed by the filing of
a referendum petition within 30 days after the passage thereof, unless the
Clerk shall certify that the petition is invalid or insufficient. Each
repealing measure proposed by a referendum petition finally certified by the
Clerk to be valid and sufficient shall, upon presentation, be referred by
Council to a committee to hold a public hearing thereon and to report its
recommendations at the next regular meeting of Council. Council shall, not
later than the second regular meeting following such reference, either pass the
repealing measure or take such action as may be required to submit it to a vote
of the electors at the next general or primary election occurring more than 90
days thereafter, or at a special election to be held on a date fixed by Council
by a vote of at least five members thereof. If the repealing measure is
approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon, the repeal shall take
effect immediately; otherwise the ordinance or measure subject to referendum
shall either remain in effect or take effect immediately.
ARTICLE 5. NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS.
 
Nominations shall be made, the form of ballots determined and all elections
held and conducted pursuant to the laws of Ohio, including all statutes now or
hereafter enacted, applicable to the nomination and election of officers of
Ohio municipal corporations having a population the same size as the Village in

financial condition and future needs of the Village, prepare and submit an
annual report and such other reports as may be required, issue all licenses and

counsel for, the Village and for all officers and departments thereof in all
matters relating to their official duties and shall when requested give legal
opinions in writing. The City Solicitor shall represent the Village in all
suits or cases in which it may be a party and shall prosecute all offenses
against the ordinances of the Village and such offenses against the laws of
Ohio as may be required by law. The City Solicitor shall, on request of the
City Manager, prepare all contracts, bonds and other instruments in writing in
which the Village is concerned, and shall endorse approval of the form and
correctness thereof on each. The City Solicitor shall perform all other duties
of a legal nature imposed by any ordinance or measure of Council or imposed
upon the chief legal officers of municipalities by a general law of Ohio which
such municipalities are not entitled to modify. The City Manager may retain
special counsel to handle any such matters as the City Manager deems necessary.

Members of Council, the Mayor, the Vice-Mayor, and members of the Village
Planning Commission shall receive no salary or other compensation for their
services. The salaries, fees, and other compensation payable to other officers,
subordinates, employees, agents, or other persons, for services rendered to or

in the service of the Village, except as otherwise prescribed in this Charter.
Any officer, subordinate, or employee appointed by the City Manager may be laid
off, suspended, reduced in rank, or removed by the City Manager, and this
action shall be final. The City Manager shall have full authority to leave
positions under a single position whenever it is deemed to be in the best
interest of the Village.
Neither Council, nor its committees or members shall direct or request the
appointment of any person to, or removal from, office by the City Manager, or
in any manner take part in the appointment, discipline, or removal of
subordinates and employees in the administrative service of the Village.
Council, its committees, and its members shall deal with that portion of the
service of the Village for which the City Manager is responsible solely through
the City Manager, and neither Council, nor its committees or members, shall
give any orders to any subordinate of the City Manager. In case any member
shall be found by Council to have violated this section, Council shall declare
that member's seat vacant. Council may, however, inquire into the conduct of
any office or department, the performance of any contract, or any of the

adopted pursuant hereto shall be exclusive as to the personnel and civil
service of the Village and are intended to supersede any provision of state
civil service law with which it may conflict.
Classified positions may be filled by appointment or promotion. Such classified
positions shall be filled by a competitive examination, insofar as practicable,
and when a vacancy occurs in such position, the Personnel Director, or the
person holding such equivalent position as Council may from time-to-time
establish by ordinance, shall notify the City Manager of that fact and the
Personnel Director shall certify to the City Manager, for each such vacancy to
be filled, the names and addresses of three candidates with the highest rating
as established by the competitive examination and other criteria established by

certified. This procedure is intended to supersede any state civil service
statute with which it conflicts.

Council and four electors of the Village. Village Planning Commission members

following such reference, either pass or reject the proposed ordinance, but no
change shall be made therein without the consent of the Village Planning
Commission or, if such consent is not given, without the vote of at least five
members of Council. Any amendment to such proposed ordinance shall be submitted
to the Village Planning Commission, and, unless it shall approve or fail to
report within 25 days, no amendment may be passed without a vote of at least
five members.
Section 8.4 Appeals.
Appeals on the ground of undue hardship from any decision, made by the City
Manager in the administration of any such ordinances, may be taken to the
Village Planning Commission and shall be determined by the vote of not less
than three of the members thereof.
ARTICLE 9. POLICE AND FIRE.
 
The Village shall have all powers to organize and maintain a police department
and a fire department, granted to municipalities by the constitution and the
laws of Ohio including all statutes now or hereafter enacted, and it is the
desire and intent of the people of the Village that the police department for
the Village shall be known as the Indian Hill Rangers. By reason of such powers
or otherwise, the Village shall have power to enter into contracts obligating
Ohio corporations, not for profit, to render for periods not exceeding 10 years
any or all police services within the jurisdictional limits of the Village,
including the preservation of the peace, the protection of persons and property
and the obedience and enforcement of ordinances and all criminal laws, and also
any or all fire protection services within the territorial limits of the
Village, including the protection of lives and property in case of fire. Each
contract shall provide that any provision thereof may be modified by mutual
agreement for the purpose of improving or extending the services to be
rendered; and that it may be terminated before expiration, by a vote of at
least five members of Council if public safety is endangered because of any
inadequacy of the services, or by a resolution proposed by initiative petition
and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon. Council may
negotiate and agree upon all other details of each contract, including the
amounts payable thereunder, and may cause the properly qualified employees of
the corporations, respectively, to be vested with all the powers granted to the
members of police or fire departments of municipalities by the laws of Ohio
including all statutes now or hereafter enacted.
ARTICLE 10. MISCELLANEOUS.
Section 10.1 Capital Improvement Reserve.
Council shall create and maintain a capital improvement reserve fund and shall
transfer or appropriate thereto the unencumbered balance remaining in the
general fund of the Village at the end of each fiscal year; provided, however,
that Council shall retain in the general fund at the end of each fiscal year
for general fund purposes for the succeeding fiscal year the lesser of: (1) the
year-end balance of the general fund; or (2) an amount equal to 20% of the
aggregate general fund expenditures for the fiscal year then ended. The
foregoing moneys so retained shall not be taken into account in preparing the
appropriations budget for the ensuing year.
Section 10.2 Fluoridation.
Any ordinance or other measure enacted by Council which provides for or
authorizes the fluoridation of water furnished to the Village or its people or
processed and distributed by any water works which may now or hereafter be
maintained or operated by the Village must first be approved by a majority of
the electors voting on the question at a general election before said ordinance
shall become effective.
Section 10.3 Force and Effect of Charter.
The residents of the City of the Village of Indian Hill first adopted this
Charter on December 16, 1941, and it took effect from and after its adoption.

was approved by the residents of the Village and took effect on March 17, 2020.

division (B) hereof, a charge in writing shall be filed with the Clerk of the
Mayor’s Court, an entry thereof made upon the journal and an opportunity given

the Mayor thereof, conditioned that if judgment is rendered against such
person, he or she will abide by and perform the order or judgment.

§ 34.27 GENERAL GUIDE TO MANAGER IN RECRUITING POLICE OFFICERS.
   (A)   No person shall be eligible to receive an original appointment as a
police officer, unless the person has reached the age of 21 and has, not more
than 120 days prior to the date of such appointment, passed a medical
examination as required by a federal or state law, or civil service rules, or
required by rules established by the state public pension funds, or required
for police training programs.
   (B)   Each person after receiving a conditional offer of employment shall be
required to undergo a medical examination. Medical examinations shall be
performed by a physician selected by the Personnel Director and shall be paid

examiner shall report and certify to the Personnel Director that the person is
free of heart, cardiovascular, respiratory and pulmonary disease, and that the
applicant meets the physical or mental requirements necessary to perform the
duties of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation. If the
medical examiner certifies that the person is not physically or mentally
capable of performing the essential functions of the position to which he or
she has been appointed, and it can be shown that no reasonable accommodation is
available that would enable the individual to perform the essential functions
of the position or that a requested accommodation would impose an undue
hardship on the city, then that person would no longer be eligible for
employment in that position with the city and the conditional offer of
employment will be withdrawn.
   (C)   The appointing authority shall, prior to making any such appointment,
file with the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund a copy of the report or
findings of the medical examiner. No person shall be eligible to receive an

Any such member may be required to take special examinations over and above the
examinations required by § 34.27 as in the opinion of the City Manager may fit
the need of any particular member's health condition.

§ 34.30 LIMITED DUTY OR DISCHARGE.
   In the event any member's health or physical condition is such as to render
him unable to perform his duties as a member of the department with full
effectiveness and there is no other existing position open to him upon which he
is qualified, having in mind his physical condition and health, will enable him
to be an effective member of the department, or of the Village of Indian Hill,
the City Manager may take action as he/she may deem best with respect to
limited duty or discharge of members who fail to have the physical condition
and health sufficient to permit the member’s full and effective service as a
member of the department or of the Village of Indian Hill.

§ 35.21 OVERTIME.
   (A)   Permanent, full-time employees who are compensated on an hourly basis,
will be compensated for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in any one week
or over eight or ten hours per shift (depending on how shifts are assigned) at
a rate of one and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay. The eight or ten
hour overtime provision shall not apply to training time assigned or approved
by the Village of Indian Hill.
   (B)   For time served over regular scheduled work periods by employees of

compensatory time off during any workweek or may adjust the schedule of an
exempt employee within a workweek to avoid the accrual of exempt compensatory
time.
   (B)   Non-Exempt Compensatory Time. Upon application to, and approval of the
employee's department head, a permanent, full-time employee may be granted
compensatory time off from work in lieu of overtime compensation. Compensatory
time shall be accumulated at a rate of one and one-half hours for each hour of
overtime worked.
   (C)   An FLSA exempt and non-exempt employee may accumulate up to 80 hours
(92 hours for police personnel) of unused compensatory time in a compensatory
time "bank" unless provided for differently through a collective bargaining
agreement. Once this limit is reached, the employee must be paid for any
additional overtime hours worked, or must use a portion of accumulated
compensatory time before any additional compensatory time may be accumulated.
   (D)   The village may choose to periodically cash an employee's compensatory
time at any time during his/her employment.
   (E)   No part-time, temporary or seasonal employee shall be entitled to
compensatory time.
   (F)   Employees of the Police Department who are assigned to work 84 hours
within a 14-day pay period shall be entitled to receive two hours Kelly Time
Off during each two-week pay period. The scheduling of such time off shall be
at the discretion of the supervising shift lieutenant, or in his/her absence,
the Assistant Chief or Chief of Police.
   (G)   Payment for Unused Compensatory Time. Any employee at the time of
retirement or leaving the service of the city will be paid for all unused
compensatory time up to a maximum of 80 hours for all eligible employees (92
hours for police employees assigned to rotating shifts). The rate of
compensation shall be at the regular rate of pay earned at the time of
separation. In the event of a death of an employee, unused compensatory time
shall become payable in a lump sum. The rate of compensation shall be at the
regular rate of pay earned at time of death. Such payment shall be made in
accordance with R.C. § 2113.04, or be paid to the employee's estate with
appropriate taxes withheld.

the Village of Indian Hill who have accumulated a sick leave balance of 720
hours shall be compensated annually for 33.3% of the number of hours in excess
of 720 hours, not to exceed 120 hours each year. This compensation will be at
the hourly rate of base pay in effect at the time of payment. The actual
payment to an employee in any one year shall not exceed 40 hours of pay. The
remaining unused sick leave, not to exceed 80 hours per year shall be
accumulated with the original 720-hour balance to a maximum allowable sick
leave balance of 960 hours. The number of benefit hours shall be based upon a

agency may transfer any unused and/or uncashed sick leave balance, up to a
maximum of 960 hours, to the Village of Indian Hill provided that the re-
employment takes place within ten years of the date on which the employee was
last terminated from public service. Any employee who has prior service with a
public agency outside the State of Ohio will only be eligible to transfer sick
leave from their immediate previous employer, up to a maximum of 960 hours. To
receive such credit, the employee must present a written statement from their
past public employer attesting to the amount of unused sick leave the employee
accumulated, and certifying that the employee had not been compensated for the
accumulated balance. Any such sick leave accumulated while employed by another
public agency shall, upon exhaustion of sick leave accumulated while employed
by the Village of Indian Hill, be available for use by the employee under the
applicable sick leave use provisions contained in the personnel policies.
Transferred sick leave shall not be eligible for compensation under either the
annual incentive pay program specified under incentive pay for unused sick
leave or the retirement compensation specified under payment for accrued sick
leave upon retirement. The maximm combined usable balance of Village of Indian
Hill accumulated and transferred sick leave that can carry over for future use
shall not exceed 960 hours on December 1st of any year.
   (E)   Payment for Accrued Sick Leave. Any employee at the time of a
disability or service retirement will be paid one-half of his or her accrued
sick leave up to a maximum payment of 60 days' pay. Such payment shall be based
on the employee's rate of pay at the time of retirement. Payment for sick leave
on this basis shall be considered to eliminate all sick leave credit accrued by
the employee at that time. Such payment shall be made only once to any
employee. In the event of a death of an employee, the employee's accrued but
unused sick leave will be converted to a lump sum payment in the same manner
and up to the same maximum payment as set forth for retirement pay-outs. If an
employee dies as a direct result of the performance of their work duties, 100%
of the employee's accrued, unused sick leave shall be converted to a lump sum
payment. Such payments for accrued sick leave upon death shall be made in
accordance with R.C. § 2113.04, or be paid to the employee's estate with
appropriate taxes withheld. Employees who do not retire but who terminate city
employment, or whose city employment is terminated for any reason, or who
transfers employment, shall not be eligible for such payment for accrued sick
leave.

§ 35.32 HEALTHCARE OPTION.
   (A)   Waiver. Permanent, full-time or other benefit eligible employees and
dependents of the Village of Indian Hill may be eligible for health insurance
coverage under the village's group health insurance plan(s) on the basis of a
joint employer-employee contribution as are from time to time determined by
Council during service to the village. Employees who are able to obtain health
insurance through the employer of a spouse or other source, may choose to
decline the employer group healthcare option for minimum essential coverage
(MEC) offered by the Village of Indian Hill. Members who choose to decline
health insurance coverage shall still be entitled to maintain dental and vision
coverage and life insurance on the same terms and conditions as those employees
who elect not to waive coverage. In order to be eligible to exercise the health
insurance coverage waiver, an employee must provide the village with a
completed, signed waiver-form indicating that the employee has voluntarily
chosen to decline the village-supplied group health insurance and submit
reasonable evidence of alternative coverage which includes an employee's
attestation that the employee and all other members of the employee's expected
tax family, if any, have or will have minimum essential coverage (other than
coverage in the individual marketplace or Medicare). Upon satisfactory proof of
adequate coverage, the City Manager may authorize the payment of a $4,000
incentive paid in quarterly payments of $1,000 to employees opting out of
coverage. Payments will be made as soon after the end of each plan year quarter
as administratively practicable. The amount will be prorated for the time that
an employee is eligible for coverage and waives coverage. The change to
quarterly payments will begin with the August 1, 2023 plan year.
   (B)   Employees who have opted out of the village-supplied group health
insurance coverage and who lose their alternative source of health insurance
coverage may apply to rejoin the plan during the period of open enrollment or
pursuant to some other qualifying event giving rise to the need and eligibility
to rejoin the plan. In such instances of a qualifying event, the Village of
Indian Hill reserves the right to require the employee to provide proof of the
loss of alternative insurance. Employees rejoining the plan will no longer be
eligible for the waiver payment unless the employee has been off the village's
group health insurance plan for three consecutive months prior to the date of
the quarterly payment.
   (C)   This health care insurance option shall not be available to otherwise
eligible employees when the spouse or dependent child is also an employee of
the Village of Indian Hill and the alternative health care insurance coverage
is also provided by the Village of Indian Hill. The waiver shall not be
available to permanent, part-time employees who receive health care insurance
as part of a retirement package from a previous employer.
   (D)   Health Savings Account. Along with the village's group health
insurance plan(s), the village may offer eligible employees the opportunity to
participate in a health savings account (HSA) when covered by a high deductible
health plan (HDHP). Under the health savings account option, the village may
contribute an amount each year into an HSA for each participating employee
based on budget availability. The amount the village contributes is based upon
the medical insurance plan the employee selects for their coverage. All annual
employer contributions may be made quarterly as soon after the end of each plan
year quarter as administratively practicable. The change to quarterly payments
will begin with the August 1, 2023 plan year. New hires will receive quarterly
contributions on a pro-rata basis corresponding to the number of months of
elected coverage. Contributions vest immediately. All contributions become
property of the employee when they are deposited in the employee's HSA account.
The village may recoup, or recover, contributions made to an employee's HSA
only if the employee was never HSA-eligible, the village contribution alone
exceeds the employee's statutory maximum annual contribution for the calendar
year, or the village contributed more than the maximum annual contribution
based on the employee's age and type of coverage elected. Should an employee go
from family coverage to individual coverage during the year the village cannot
reclaim the money already provided to the employee. If an employee is hired or
increases coverage during the year the village will deposit funds or additional
funds on a pro-rata basis. If an employee reduces coverage during the year or
leaves employment of the village during the year, a portion of the village's or
employee's contributions may become taxable and subject to possible penalties
based on IRS limitations. In addition to the amount funded by the village, the
employee has the option of depositing additional funds through tax deferred
payroll deductions up to the limits established by the IRS. Employees must open
a health savings account prior to the village being able to deposit funds.

§ 35.33 LIFE INSURANCE.

clerk/comptroller are provided with group term basic life and accidental death
and dismemberment insurance beginning on the first day of the month following
the employee's date of hire. The city shall provide coverage in the amount
equal to the employee's base annual compensation, rounded to the nearest
thousand dollars, up to a maximum of $75,000 coverage, subject to policy
reduction formulas at age 65. For the purpose of determining the amount of such
coverage, the base annual compensation shall be that salary which is in effect
on January 1 of each year. The cost of group term basic life insurance in
excess of $50,000 is includable in gross income as wages subject to Federal
Income Contributions Act (FICA) tax. The cost of group term life insurance is
determined on the basis of uniform premiums computed on the basis of five-year
age brackets prescribed by U.S. Treasury Regulations.

base salary in the determination of annual compensation nor shall the failure
to award merit or the award of a lesser amount from year to year be considered
as disciplinary action or as a decrease in performance.

indemnify any current or former elected or appointed village officer, employee,

village ("village representative"), whether or not such village representative
is compensated for such service, from liability incurred in the performance of
his or her duties by paying any judgment in, or amount negotiated in settlement
of, any civil action arising under federal, state or local law. The village's
duty to pay the amount of any consent judgment or settlement shall be

City Council. The foregoing indemnification shall include indemnification for
the cost of defense of any such action.

the following circumstances:
      (1)   To the extent the village representative is covered by a policy of
insurance for civil liability purchased by the village;
      (2)   When the village representative acts manifestly outside the scope
of his or her employment or official responsibilities, or with malicious
purpose, or in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, as determined in
the reasonable discretion of the City Solicitor and City Council;
      (3)   For any portion of a judgment that represents punitive or exemplary
damages;
      (4)   For any portion of a consent judgment or settlement which is not
reviewed and approved by the City Solicitor and the City Council.
   (C)   The village may purchase a policy or policies of insurance on behalf
of village representatives providing coverage for amounts in excess of
$1,000,000 per occurrence incurred in connection with any civil action, demand,
or claim against the village representative occurring in the performance of his
or her official village duties and not coming within the terms of division (B)

   (E)   The indemnification of village representatives against judgments or
settlements pursuant to this section shall be accomplished only through the

division (B)(2) of this section, an indemnity agreement shall be prepared by
the City Solicitor, specifying that the village will indemnify the village
representative from a particular judgment that has been rendered or a
particular settlement amount that has been negotiated. The agreement shall name
the person or entity to whom payment by the village of the judgment or
settlement amount will be made, and the agreement shall not be effective until
it is approved by the village representative, the City Solicitor and the City
Council. The City Solicitor shall approve the indemnity agreement unless he or
she finds that division (B) of this section prohibits the village from
indemnifying the village representative, or prohibits the village from
indemnifying the village person for a portion of a judgment or settlement and
the indemnity agreement would indemnify the village representative for all or
part of that portion.
      (2)   If sufficient moneys have not been appropriated, the City Council
shall appropriate sufficient funds to pay the indemnification, and no payment
shall be made until the appropriation has been made.
   (F)   A village representative may commence an action against the village in
a court of competent jurisdiction to prove that he or she is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to division (A) of this section and that division (B)
of this section does not prohibit or limit his or her indemnification and
seeking either a judgment against the village for a sum of money that the
village representative has paid to satisfy a judgment or settlement, or an
order directing the village to pay a judgment or settlement against the village
representative which has not been satisfied.
   (G)   An action brought pursuant to this section shall be commenced no later
than two years after the cause of action arising under this section accrues. A
cause of action arising under this section accrues upon the entry of a money
judgment against village representatives if the time for filing an appeal in
the action lapses without the filing of an appeal; upon the conclusion of the
final appeal in any action in which a money judgment is entered against the
village representative if an appeal is filed in the action; or upon execution
of any settlement agreement requiring payment of money by the village
representative.

date by the superintendent and shall be open to public inspection at all times.
Copies of the requirements may be distributed by the superintendent as may be
determined by him from time to time.
   (B)   No water main extension shall be constructed on any new street or any
undedicated street unless the location of the street has been approved by the
village planning commission and until all the requirements of all other
ordinances, if any, have been complied with.
   (C)   No water main extension shall be laid in any unimproved street whose
profile is such that in case of the improvement of the street, it would be
necessary to relay the main to conform with the then established grade and no
water main shall be constructed under the provisions of §
51.23, where, owing to the topography of the territory abutting the street, or
to other conditions, further property development is precluded or is unlikely.
   (D)   The superintendent shall maintain a record of all charges outstanding
against premises abutting streets improved with water main extension in
accordance with §
51.23 or §
51.24. The record shall be suitably indexed as to streets and part of streets,
and shall at all times be available for public inspection. With the consent of
the county auditor, a duplicate copy of the record shall be kept on file in the
office of the county auditor for the convenience of title examiners and
prospective purchasers of real estate. As the charges are paid or as new
charges are imposed, the necessary notation shall be made in that record by way
of amendment or supplement. The notation by way of amendment or supplement
shall be copied into the county auditor's duplicate record at intervals of not
more than 30 days. The record shall at all times be accompanied by a statement
from the superintendent indicating the date to which the record has been
carried.

§ 51.26 RETAIL SERVICE AREA AND SPECIAL BENEFIT DISTRICT SERVED BY CITY OF
CINCINNATI WATER WORKS.
   (A)   There is established a retail service area for the City of Cincinnati
Water Works inside the village described in the water agreement by and between
the City of Cincinnati and the City of the Village of Indian Hill, dated
December 21, 1984, as the area bounded on the west, north, and east by the
Indian Hill corporation line and on the south generally bounded by the south
line of Section Number 34 of Symmes Township, and the south line of Section
Number 4 of Sycamore Township.
   (B)   A portion of that service area, comprised of parcels listed in the
Appendix, is herewith defined as being the area benefited by the 12-inch trunk
water distribution main constructed in Hopewell Road and Montgomery Road as
shown on approved plan, Cincinnati Water Works Job No. 4- 1837, dated January
16, 1985, at village expense in the public interest for supplying water to that
area in adequate quantities and pressures for domestic use and fire
suppression.
   (C)   The benefited properties are identified on the Appendix to this
chapter by a listing compiled from the Hamilton County Auditor's property
records, showing book, page, parcel number, and gross acreage.
   (D)   Provision is made for owners of those properties within that benefited
area to obtain water service from this 12-inch trunk water distribution main by
a direct tap/connection or indirectly by a system of public water main
extensions or loops with this distribution main.
   (E)   Owners or their agents desiring water service within the benefited
area shall make application for such service jointly to the director of the
Cincinnati Water Works and to the superintendent of Village Water Works. No
service branch or service main shall be approved or installed until the owner
of the benefited property, as set forth in the Appendix, shall have paid, in
advance, to the village a tap-in fee, calculated on the district rate/acre in
effect at the time of application, times the total number of acres being
benefited or having the potential for being benefited as a result of the
service line applied for.
      (1)   Tap-in fees for water main extensions intended to serve a
subdivision shall be calculated on the basis of gross acreage of the entire
subdivision receiving benefit.
      (2)   Tap-in fees for water service branches serving a single residential
dwelling, not part of a subdivision, shall be calculated on the gross acreage
of the parcel on which the dwelling is being constructed and receiving benefit.
      (3)   The tap-in fees shall be paid in addition to any other established
permit fee or construction charges incurred for the installation of water main
extensions or service branches.
      (4)   In the event that a large parcel, for which the tap-in fee has been
paid, is later subdivided further, no additional tap-in fees will be applied
for service branches required to serve the additional dwellings on the same
tract of land; however, normal fees and costs for the service branch
installation will be charged.
      (5)   The Superintendent of Village Water Works shall maintain accurate
records of the parcels subject to paying tap-in fees and shall establish and
administer the procedure for collecting those fees. The initial tap-in fee
shall be calculated on the basis of total project cost, including engineering,
inspection, construction, interest charge, if any, and total acres being
benefited. Fees shall be adjusted no less than at least once every five
calendar years to reflect an interest charge being paid on bond anticipation
notes or other securities being used to finance the water main to serve this
district, commencing at the date of completion of construction and placing in
service of said water main. He shall arrange for the Appendix to be updated and
amended as necessary to indicate payment of tap-in fees for individual parcels
and to record any boundary line changes which might occur as a result of
replatting.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no tap/connection
shall be made to the new 12-inch trunk water line serving the benefited area,
as created in the Appendix, to serve any portion of a subdivision located in
the benefited area, which subdivision's plat was approved prior to the
effective date of this section, in anticipation of an adequate water supply
being available by the construction of the 12-inch trunk water line, without
there first having been paid a tap-in fee, calculated in the manner set forth
in this section.

SERVICE BRANCHES
§ 51.35 APPLICATION PROCEDURES.
   Any property owner desiring the installation of a service branch into his
premises shall make application through a licensed master plumber as his
authorized agent. By making application for a service branch, or by using or
permitting use of a service branch already installed, the owner agrees to be
bound by all the provisions of this operating code and as it may be amended
from time to time, and by the "Engineering and Plumbing Requirements"
promulgated by the Superintendent and all other lawful rules of the department
of water works.
('80 Code, § 52.15) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)
§ 51.36 AUTHORITY OF SUPERINTENDENT REQUIRED.
   No service branch shall be installed to serve property which does not abut
the street or road in which the service main is located except with authority
of the Superintendent and the village planning commission. Every residence or
user shall have its separate service branch and meter. However, a variance in
this respect may be authorized by the Superintendent and the village planning
commission if it is shown that the variance will not be harmful to the water
works system, in the present or in the future. In authorizing the variance the
conditions as may be necessary and proper may be attached.
('80 Code, § 52.16) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)
§ 51.37 SERVICE BRANCH REGULATIONS.
   (A)   When a service branch and water meter is installed, so much of the
branch as is in the highway to the front lot line shall be installed by the
Department but shall be paid for by the property owner at the time of the
application for water service, the payment to be as established by ordinance.
Except in cases where service branches are installed for vacant property in
connection with highway improvements, applications for service branch
installations shall be accompanied by application for meters which shall also
be paid for at the time of the application.
      (1)   Only metered water service branches shall be permitted.
      (2)   Branches installed for fire protection shall be subject to
"Engineering and Plumbing Requirements" provided that a branch for any
principal building hereafter constructed shall be provided with one fire
hydrant for every 500 feet of the branch to be no less than eight inches in
diameter.
      (3)   Application for water service shall be made by the owner of the
premises to be supplied, or by his or her authorized agent. Water will be
turned on by an authorized employee of the Department after the application has
been duly filed at the village office.
      (4)   No application for water service will be allowed or no water shall
be supplied to any applicant or consumer where the applicant or consumer is
indebted to the Department for water supplied, work done, materials furnished
or penalties imposed. This section will apply whether the indebtedness was
incurred at the premises for which application is made or at any other premises
supplied by the Department within or without the village limits.
   (B)   No permit for the erection of a building shall be approved by the City
Manager unless an application for a service branch has been made, or an
application for meter has been made in cases where the service branch has
previously been installed.
   (C)   No water service branch shall at any time be laid in the same trench
with a sewer connection, electrical supply cable or telephone cable.
   (D)   Where any parcel of property is supplied through two or more
connecting service branches each branch shall be equipped with a check valve so
set that water can flow into and not out of the premises and each service
branch shall be equipped with a separate meter.
   (E)   Water service branches shall be the property of the owners of the
property served by them and that portion of the service branch from the curb
cock into the premises served shall be maintained in proper condition by the
owners. Failure to repair a leak or leaks when notified of same within the time
allowed on the notice shall be sufficient cause to justify the Department in
discontinuing water service.
   (F)   No connection into more than one building shall be made from one tap
unless the Superintendent has given his or her approval in writing.
   (G)   No attachment shall be made to any service branch or to any pipe or
other fixture which has been shut off pursuant to this operating code or order
of the Superintendent without first having obtained a permit upon application
duly made, nor shall water be taken from any service branch which is or has
been out of use without such a permit.
   (H)   The original purchase of a meter shall be made by the consumer but
after it has been installed and placed in service, the Department will assume
the maintenance of the meter or its replacement without charge to the consumer,
except that in cases of damage by freezing, hot water, or other neglect on the
part of the consumer, the cost of repairs or replacement shall be charged to
the consumer.
   (I)   Meters shall be fully and substantially set in a workmanlike manner
and in accordance with the "Engineering and Plumbing Requirements". Meters
hereafter installed shall be placed in a frost-proof meter box or pit, plans
for which may be obtained from the Department, and shall be placed at the front
lot line.
   (J)   The Superintendent and authorized employees of the Department shall
have the right at reasonable times to enter any premises where a meter is
installed for the purpose of reading, examining, inspecting, or testing the
same. The Superintendent shall be authorized to fix reasonable charges for the
removal, examination, inspection, testing, and reinstating meters upon
application of the consumer.
   (K)    Meter and service branch charges as set forth in the Appendix
following this chapter, are hereby adopted and shall be effective January 1,
2024. System customers who increase the size of their meter and service
branches shall be responsible for paying a fee equal to the difference in cost
between their present service size and the increase service size as set forth
in the Appendix.
   (L)   There are hereby established Capital Improvement Debt Service Fees for
the purpose of paying a portion of the cost of capital improvements to the
Water Works System and the costs associated with the financing of said
improvements. Said fees shall be in addition to meter and service branch fees
specified under division (K) of this section and shall be deposited in the
Water Works Capital Improvement Reserve Fund. These fees shall be applicable to
all new water system taps made within the Water Works System service area and
shall be in the amounts specified below:

shall be prepared. A charge of $25 shall be applied to all accounts scheduled
for shut-off. As soon thereafter as practical, the shut-off bill shall be
presented at the premises and if the same is not paid, the water shall be shut
off immediately, and it shall not, thereafter be turned on again until all

   (B)   The village shall disconnect utility service in accord with the
following policies:
      (1)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid and any deposit required
has been made. It is the policy of the village to discontinue utility service
to customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a
meaningful opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The village's form for
application for utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the
title, address, room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of
billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill; and
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second
bill will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid
within ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued
for nonpayment; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his bill shall
have a right to a hearing at which time he may be represented in person and by
counsel or any other person of his choosing and may present orally or in
writing his complaint and contentions to the village official in charge of
utility billing. This official shall be authorized to order that the customer's
service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make a final
determination of the customer's complaint.
      (2)   With the exception of approved extensions as specified in §
51.65, requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified.
('80 Code, § 52.31) (Am. Ord. 9-96, passed 4-22-96; Am. Ord. 17-97, passed 9-

   The Superintendent shall assess and collect proper charges for water,
materials supplied, and work done. Any owner of real estate premises installing

premises, whether the accounts for the premises are carried in the name of the
owner or in the name of tenants or other persons.

§ 51.68 LEAKAGES.
   No reduction in water charges shall be made for leakage except in cases
where it shall appear, on investigation, that the leakage is underground and
not subject to detection by ordinary methods, and where, further, the owner and
other occupants of the premises are free from negligence in causing or failing
to report the leakage; excepting, also, in cases during periods of emergency,
when, by reason of shortage in materials or manpower, immediate repairs are not
available, where the owner has made diligent efforts to provide the repairs and
has actually employed a plumber to make them, in which cases an allowance of
time of not to exceed 30 days may be granted to permit the plumber to complete
the repairs. No reduction for leakage shall be permitted in an amount in excess
of 50% of the water bill as rendered. ('80 Code, § 52.33) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-
29-49)

('80 Code, § 52.34) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49)
§ 51.70 BILLS.
   Bills for water supplied, work done or material furnished will be delivered
at the premises or where directed, as a matter of convenience to the owners of
property or their agents. Failure to receive bills will not relieve from
responsibility for prompt payment. Duplicate bills may be obtained upon
application.

§ 51.73 DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   Accounts unpaid on the date indicated on the bill shall be considered as
delinquent, and a notice of delinquency shall thereupon be mailed. If the
account is unpaid on the date shown on the delinquent notice, it shall be
placed in the hands of a turnkey for collection. When the turnkey cannot make
collection, the water shall be shut off. If a delinquent account remains unpaid
the city reserves the right under the law, to certify same to the Hamilton
County Auditor by a certificate signed by the Finance Director. The County
Auditor shall then place the amount certified by signed certificate on the
appropriate tax duplicate with interest and penalties allowed by law, including
the applicable assessment fee. The same shall be collected as all other taxes
and shall be considered as a lien upon the real property.
('80 Code, § 52.38) (Ord. 5-49, passed 3-29-49; Am. Ord. 18-17, passed 12-18-
17)
§ 51.74 RESTORATION OF SERVICE.
   If a bill is paid after the water has been shut off, service will not be
restored until the following day. In addition to charges shown on the water
bill, every delinquent account shall be subject to an additional charge of $25
for service, whether the turnkey calls for collection or not.
('80 Code, § 52.39) (Ord. 9-96, passed 4-22-96)

   GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The village is vitally concerned with the use of all rights-of-way in
the village as such rights-of-way are a valuable and limited resource which
must be utilized to promote the public health, safety, and welfare including
the economic development of the village.
   (B)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries have
increased the demand and need for access to rights-of-way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.
   (C)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and
structures and facilities in, the rights-of-way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the rights-of-way, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
   (D)   The village has authority under the Laws and Constitution of the State
of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4, and 7, to
regulate public and private entities which use the rights-of-way.

   CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION
§ 52.045 NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the village for the limited purposes
and for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in
accordance with this chapter and all laws including any rules and regulations
adopted by the Public Works Superintendent. The rights to locate facilities
and/or a system in and the rights to occupy the right-of-way itself may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however, provider may sublease capacity (or
other nonmaterial facility aspects) and two or more providers may collocate
facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each such provider
complies with the provisions of this chapter. Collocating providers may file a
joint application for a construction permit. A certificate of registration does
not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including
the village's facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a
provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the
sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the
provisions of this chapter. A certificate of registration does not excuse a
provider from complying with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable
law.

all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the village's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the village. Further, a certificate of registration
issued pursuant to this chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the village.

   CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION
§ 52.165 TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUIRED.
   Prior to commencement of any initial construction of facilities in the
rights-of-way a construction permittee, upon the reasonable request of the
Public Works Superintendent, shall provide technical information about the
proposed route of construction. The technical information required may consist
of completion of the following tasks:
   (A)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location data
indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along the
proposed construction route.
   (B)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
   (C)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all underground facilities the applicant or person on
whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the rights-of-way
along the proposed system route. Upon the reasonable request of the Public
Works Superintendent, a permittee shall also record and identify the general
location of all other facilities in the rights-of-way along the proposed system
route. For the purposes of this section, general location shall mean the
alignment of other facilities in the rights-of-way, but shall not necessarily
mean the depth of other facilities in the rights-of-way.
   (D)   If a provider records the information requested above in an electronic
format, the provider shall provide the village with an electronic copy of the
data obtained from completion of the tasks described in this section.
Incorporation of the data required herein by electronic means shall include
only data for new facilities that can be readily incorporated into the
village's database.
   (E)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of existing
underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A construction permittee shall not excavate more than a
three foot by three foot square hole in the rights-of-way to complete this
task.
   (F)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
   (G)   All confidential/proprietary information submitted herein shall be so
labeled.

applicable laws.
   (B)   The village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and
welfare, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year, the protection
of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future village and county plans
for public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be
in the public interest, and the nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
   (C)   Upon the concurrence of the village, or if it is determined by the
construction permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or
other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the
rights-of-way are full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional facilities or systems only
after the construction permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
division shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new facilities or additional
facilities are attached.

its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the village finds it necessary to
request such removal and relocation. In instances where the village requests
removal and/or relocation, the village shall waive all applicable construction
permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall restore the
rights-of-way to a condition at least as good as its condition immediately
prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be
removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the village. The Public Works Superintendent may request
relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the
provider's facilities with:
      (1)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the village or
county;
      (2)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.04.
   (C)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the village, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the village, within 30 days after the village's removal order is served upon
provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the village, within 12
months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law,
the village shall have the right to:
      (1)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation;
      (2)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the village at provider's cost and
expense, by another person, however, the village shall have no liability for
any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the
village for all reasonable costs incurred by the village in such action; and
      (3)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the village
designated by the village for removal and not timely removed by the provider
shall belong to and become the property of the village without payment to the
provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the village, to
evidence such ownership by the village.

to the condition required by the village, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required by the village, the village, at its option, with
notice to the provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that
event, the permittee shall pay to the village, within 30 days of billing, the
cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred by the
village. Upon failure to pay, the village may call upon any bond or letter of
credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable
remedies.

   (A)   To any person who has not yet made an application;
   (B)   To any person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
village;
   (C)   To any person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for the
revocation of a permit; or
   (D)   If, in the discretion of the Public Works Superintendent, the issuance
of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Public Works Superintendent, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-
way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
(Ord. 03-02, passed 2-25-02; Am. Ord. 06-18, passed 9-24-18)
§ 52.301 PERMISSIVE DENIAL.
   The Public Works Superintendent may deny a permit in order to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the rights- of-way, or when necessary to
protect the rights-of- way and its users. The Public Works Superintendent, in
his or her discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: the
extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit is sought is available;
the competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of- way; the
availability of other locations in the rights- of-way or in other rights-of-way
for the proposed facilities; the applicability of this chapter or other
regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location of facilities in the
rights-of-way; the degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of this chapter and its requirements, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities
and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way;
the condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when it is
scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the costs of
disruption to the public and damage to the rights-of-way, against the benefits
to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the
rights-of-way; and whether such applicant or their agent has failed within the
past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with the
requirements of this chapter or, if applicable, any other chapters of the
Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable law.

village;
      (2)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
      (3)   To allow a new economic development project.
   (B)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant must
not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of service,
or the development project at the time it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.

   (A)   Emergency situations. 
      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the
Public Works Superintendent of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within two business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Public Works Superintendent, after the
occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider
shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and
fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with
this chapter for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency.
      (2)   In the event that the village becomes aware of an emergency
regarding a provider's facilities, the village may attempt to contact the
provider or system representative of each provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the emergency. In any event, the village may take whatever action
it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which
shall be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
   (B)   Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right-
of-way without a valid permit shall cease any further work upon the order of
the inspector or Public Works Superintendent and before commencing any
additional work shall within ten business days of initiating such construction
obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the
other fees required by the Codified Ordinances, deposit with the village the
fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights- of-way and comply with all
of the requirements of this chapter.

§ 52.304 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances as
a privilege and not as a right. The village reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit;
      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the village or its citizens;
      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
      (4)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required construction or
removal bonds and/or insurance;
      (5)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a certificate
of registration;
      (6)   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
      (7)   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to §
52.168.
   (B)   If the Public Works Superintendent determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
provision or condition of the permit, the Public Works Superintendent shall
serve a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. Upon a substantial breach, as stated above, the Public Works
Superintendent may place additional or revised conditions on the permit.
   (C)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Public Works
Superintendent with a plan, acceptable to the Public Works Superintendent, for
its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Public Works
Superintendent, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the permit.
   (D)   From time to time, the Public Works Superintendent may establish a
list of standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any
condition shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights-of-way
as defined in §
52.120.
   (E)   If a permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined above,
permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed further
permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
   (F)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the village
for the village's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs
of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.

§ 70.08 THROUGH HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:

§ 70.13 PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words walk or
don’t walk, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in place,
these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about

violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from

accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to

violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (B)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court shall impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7).

responsibility is maintained with respect to that vehicle.
   (B)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any public
or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking in this municipality if the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s

as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time

2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section, or
any combination of two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or
4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

has complied with all license reinstatement requirements imposed by the court,
the bureau of motor vehicles, or another provision of the Ohio Revised Code.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A) of this section may be admitted into evidence as

the person at the time of the alleged violation of division (A) of this
section. The person charged with a violation of division (A) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to reinstate a

500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of a violation of division (A) of this
section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or been convicted of two
or more violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.21 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the

direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;
         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

   (A)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left of the center of the roadway in
overtaking and passing traffic proceeding in the same direction, unless the
left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of

regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that

section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical

tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under § 4511.19(A) or (B), shall state that
the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §

violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         (c)   Division (D)(4)(b) of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of

§ 93.02 PURPOSE.
   (A)   To provide funds for the general fund for general municipal

reserves for the normal operations of the village, there is levied, subject to
any exemptions the village may enact that are permitted for qualified municipal
corporations under R.C. § 718.01(A)(1)(b)(ii), an annual tax on the income of
every person residing in the village. The tax shall be measured by municipal
taxable income, as that term is defined in R.C. § 718.01(A).
   (B)   The tax is levied in accordance with, and shall be interpreted
consistent with, the limitations specified in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised
Code, and this chapter hereby incorporates the provisions of Chapter 718 of the
Ohio Revised Code. To the extent a conflict exists between a provision in this
chapter and a provision in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code, the provision
in Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised Code shall apply and control.
(Ord. 07-15, passed 12-14-15)
§ 93.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (A)   An annual tax for the purposes specified in §
93.02 shall be imposed at the rate of 0.45% per annum upon the following:
      (1)   Resident individuals. On the individual’s adjusted gross income.
      (2)   Part-year- resident individuals. On a prorated portion of the
individual’s adjusted gross income, which proration shall be based on the
number of days that the individual resides in the village during the taxable
year; provided that in the case of an individual who claims the Part- Year
Resident Credit on Nonresident Credit on his or her Ohio income tax return for
the taxable year, it shall be presumed that the portion of the individual’s
adjusted gross income that is subject to the tax is equal to the individual’s
adjusted gross income for the taxable year minus the portion that was not
earned or received in Ohio, as that portion not earned or received in Ohio is
reported on the individual’s Ohio income tax return for the same taxable year.
      (3)   Resident C corporations. On all net profits earned during the
effective period of this chapter of all resident C corporations.
      (4)   S corporation shareholder’s distributive share. On an S corporation
shareholder’s distributive share of net profits of an S corporation.
The tax is imposed on the owners of a pass-through entity rather than on the
pass-through entity. No tax shall be imposed under §
93.03(A)(1), (A)(2), and (A)(3) if the adjusted gross income of an individual
or net profits of a C Corporation does not exceed $5,000 in the taxable year.
   (B)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a taxpayer
that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to file a
consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least one
member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the tax imposed by
this chapter in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law;
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer received permission from the tax commissioner. The
tax commissioner shall approved such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
tax commissioner determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the tax commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (5)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the village in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.

Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and Am Sub HB 64, passed by the 131st
General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich on June 30, 2015. These

enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
      (2)   As mandated by the above amendments, Council Ordinance 07-15,

January 1, 2016. All provisions of this
Chapter 93 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
      (4)   Ordinance 07-15 does not repeal the existing sections of
Chapter 93 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends
Chapter 93 effective January 1, 2016. For taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2016, the village shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce
the income tax of the village under R.C. Chapter 718 and ordinances and
resolutions of the village as that Chapter 718 and those ordinances and
resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.
   (B)   Time for filing. Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall,
whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on or before April
15 of the year following the effective date of this chapter, and on or before
April 30 of each year thereafter. When the return is made for a fiscal year or
other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed by the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of such fiscal year or

      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such gross income,
earnings, and profits;
      (3)   Any of the following, as the tax commissioner may require:
         (a)   A taxpayer who is an individual may be required to include, with
each annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal
Revenue Service from W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements.” including all information
reported on the taxpayer’s federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported, or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
from 1040 or Ohio IT 1040; and
         (b)   A taxpayer that is not an individual may be required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, and other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return;
      (4)   Each individual return shall have attached to it a copy of the
taxpayer's Ohio State Individual Income Tax return for the same year.
   (D)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested, an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that the tax
commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax commissioner on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax commissioner shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax commissioner grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return

commissioner from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom the request was
directed pursuant to §
93.08, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §

after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying information,
nothing in this chapter prohibits the tax commissioner from imposing a penalty
pursuant to §
93.08 of this chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (D)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in §
93.99 of this
Chapter 93 for fraud and any other penalties that may be imposed by the tax
commissioner by law.

presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent, or employee of a
person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the failure of any

subpoena of the tax commissioner authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter, punishable as provided in §

      (1)   Any information gained as the result of any returns,
investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this

in violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty

penalty permitted by R.C. § 718.27(C)(2)(a), as amended from time to time.

   (C)   Exceptions. A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the tax commissioner when a return has been filed in good
faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the tax
commissioner and provided, further, that in the absence of fraud, neither
penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment
resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the
additional tax is paid within three months after a final determination of the
federal tax liability.
   (D)   Abatement of penalty, interest, or both. Upon recommendation of the
tax commissioner or upon appeal from the refusal of the tax commissioner to so
recommend, the Board of Review may abate penalty or interest, or both.

   (A)   Limitation on actions. All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be

omission of a substantial portion of income subject to this tax, or failure to
file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after the later of:
(1) three years after, the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever was
later, and (2) one year after the conclusion of any qualifying deferral period,
as defined in R.C. § 718.12(A)(1)(b)(2); except that, in those cases in which
the Commissioner of internal revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of
the federal statute of limitations, the period in which an additional
assessment may be made by the Commissioner shall be one year from later of the
time of the final determination of the federal tax liability and the time when

refund is made within three years from the date on which the payment was made
or the return was due, whichever is later.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the tax commissioner shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
village official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this
section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
tax commissioner shall notify the taxpayer, in writing of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under R.C. § 718.11.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal

      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in R.C. § 718.27
(A)(5).
   (F)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject to the
municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state
tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due thereon to
make a claim for refund for any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is
less than $10.

the village by the FCC, the village or the ICRC shall immediately notify all
cable operators in the village, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
that the village intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic

its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any
supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates.
   (C)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the Village Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
benchmark, the Village Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the village.
      (2)   If the Village Council or the ICRC takes no action within 30 days
from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the village,
the proposed rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (D)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the Village Council is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the
Village Council shall, within 60 days from the date the cable operator filed
its basic cable rates with the village and by adoption of a formal resolution,
invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the Village Council needs more time to ensure
that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      (2)   If the Village Council has not made a decision within the 90- or
150-day period, the Village Council shall issue a brief written order at the
end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   (E)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the Village Council or the ICRC shall hold at
least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.
   (F)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector's name and address.
   (G)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, the Village Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the
benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.
Based on the Village Council or the ICRC's findings, the initial basic cable
rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992 and
the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The Village Council will
review a cost-of-service review. The Village Council may approve initial basic
cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the
benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minimum 10%,
will prescribe the cable operator's new rates.
   (I)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion by the village or the ICRC
of its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the Village Council shall
adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the
following:
         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of- service analysis, the Village Council shall approve
the initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of- service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the Village Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within
the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If the Village Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
Village Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with divisions (G) or
(H) above as applicable. In addition, the Village Council may order the cable
operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates
with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Village Council's decision
resolution.

proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the Village Council must give
public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement
once in the official newspaper of the village.

determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (B)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the Village Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously
determine that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable
service is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the
applicable price cap, the Village Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views: and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the village.

the cable operator filed its request with the village, the proposed rates will
go into effect.

proposed rate, the Village Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (C)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the Village Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether
the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the
material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing,
the Village Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the Village Council or the ICRC needs more time
to ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate
standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and

cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable
price cap.

period.

end of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.

action on the requested rate increase, the Village Council or the ICRC shall

and address.
   (F)   Delayed determination. If the Village Council is unable to make a
final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended
time period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the Village Council later issued a decision disapproving
any portion of the increase.
   (G)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the Village
Council shall review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Village Council's findings,
the basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the Village Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the Village Council will review the submission pursuant the FCC standards for
cost-of-service review. The Village Council may approve a rate increase above
the price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a
cost-of- service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below
the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.
   (I)   Decision. The Village Council's decision concerning the requested rate
increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made
by other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the secretary to record the objection or may be submitted in
writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (J)   Refunds.

accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Village Council's decision
resolution.

15 days prior to the date services covered by such bill commence, except in

arrears, reconnection charges if applicable, and the date by which such payment
must be made, the location of service center(s) where such payment may be made

billing dispute resolution procedure shall be initiated once a subscriber

the village or its agent in writing, so long as such contact occurs within 30
days from the date of receipt of the bill by the subscriber. If the subscriber
contacts the village or ICRC shall notify the operator, by mail, by telephone

the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) ('80 Code, § 130.04) (Ord. 3-80, passed 1-28-80)
§ 130.06 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.07 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.10 SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offenders behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offenders conduct and its impact upon the victim, and
consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a
jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the
following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and ineffect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time
under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator does not
exceed the five- year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for

offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the
courtmodify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,

   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;

         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.    Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other

               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimburse-ment under division (G)(1)(c)1. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.

treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs

division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(1)(b)1. of this section, through a certificate of
judgment as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through
execution as described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an
order as described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender
shall be considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.

under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering

any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:

$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of the City of the Village of Indian Hill (herein referred to as the
"village"), State of Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the village, as identified in §
151.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
village.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (A)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Hamilton County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both effective June 7, 2023.
   (B)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (C)   (1)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the village as required by §
151.43, Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Administration Building, 6525 Drake
Road, Cincinnati Ohio 45243.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning, or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 10-04, passed 4-19-04; Am. Ord. 03-23, passed 4-17-23)
§ 151.10 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   APPEAL. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and

   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   ZONE AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow
on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   ZONE AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.

to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY.
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the village's historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle. For the purposes of
these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 4781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 4781-
12-0l(K), any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the
village and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the
purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM (May
1, 1985) and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15(A)(2)
as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is built on a single chassis, 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection,
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture pursuant to R.C. § 4703.01 and 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as "areas of special flood hazard", it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance
studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state, or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its "before damaged" condition would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 151.29 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that the village flood maps,
studies and other data identified in §
151.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (A)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         (a)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         (b)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         (c)   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         (d)   Subdivision or other new development proposals requiring the
establish-ment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
151.43.
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with this division (A), prepared in a format required
for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         (a)   Proposed floodway encroach-ments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         (b)   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (A)(l) of
this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of the village,
and may be submitted at any time.
   (C)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occur-rence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the village have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the village's flood insurance rate map
accurately represent the village's boundaries, include within such notification
a copy of a map of the village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

§ 151.30 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
151.60 through
151.65, Appeals and Variances.
   (D)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (E)   Use of preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or flood insurance
study data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         (a)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         (b)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
         (a)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         (b)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section 4.9(8) since the
data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         (a)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, Al-30, AH, or AO. Communities are
encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that
the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.

§ 151.31 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (A)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 151.49 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
151.29(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the City Manager of the village and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Division (A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(c) through (A)(2)(e) of this
section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed develop-ments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
151.29(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victim-ization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (C)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in divisions (A)(3)(a) to (A)(3)(k)
of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

§ 152.01 PREAMBLE.
   This land use plan is part of a continuous and ongoing planning process
designed to implement the intent and purpose of the Village Charter and to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future residents of
the village. The plan addresses the types and intensities of land uses and the
system of roadways that are consistent with the village's Charter objective of
maintaining its rural character and protecting its unique natural environment.
As such, the plan not only addresses future conditions but also affirms prior
land use policies, as implemented through the village's existing zoning code,
that continue to achieve the village's Charter objective of remaining a rural-
residential community. The plan addresses the issues of land use and
environmental protection in terms of current knowledge of existing conditions.
As this plan is implemented and new conditions arise, the plan may be reviewed,
and, if necessary, modified to reflect the village's informed response to the
new circumstances.
('80 Code, § 155.01) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.02 TOPOGRAPHICAL CHARACTERISTICS.
   (A)   The village comprises 19.5 square miles and is bounded on the east and
the south by the Little Miami River, with village boundaries that roughly
correspond to the physical break between the river bottom lands and the steeply
sloping valley walls. To the west, the village boundaries are defined by the
municipal corporate limits of Montgomery, Madeira, and Mariemont. To the north,
the village limits are defined by I-275. There is a general gradient toward the
river with the highest and most level land being located on the west and the
lowest land located in the river bottoms. Most of the area is divided by
ravines and stream valleys which form the area's drainage pattern. In the
north, Sycamore Creek's three branches divide the northern half of the village
into a series of natural neighborhoods. Walton Creek, Redbird Hollow, and
smaller streams paralleling Indian Hill, Shawnee Run, Kugler Mill, and Camargo
Roads also break up the community into a series of smaller natural neighborhood
areas.
   (B)   The most rugged terrain in the village is nearest the Little Miami
River. On the steeper slopes, unstable soil conditions are found in a geologic
formation known as the Kope formation. These conditions are most in evidence
along Sycamore Creek and along the Little Miami River. Construction on these
areas or above them should not be permitted. Other major environmental features
such as woodlands, steep slopes, and ravines are likely to physically overlap,
although woodlands are also frequently found in the flatter upland areas as
well. Most of the scenic views in the village are views across the ravines and
stream valleys, while the bottoms of ravines and stream valleys provide scenic
drives. A complete inventory of the village's topographical characteristics and
environmental resources is detailed in the village's "Green Areas Study"
(December 1977), which is hereby incorporated by reference in this plan.
('80 Code, § 155.02) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.03 CHARTER OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   When the village was incorporated in 1941, the village was a rural
neighborhood of farms and single-family homes situated at the outer edge of the
Cincinnati metropolitan area. The villages to the west of this village were
also mostly rural, but gradually becoming suburban in character. It was the
vision of the framers of the Village Charter that the village should maintain
its rural character. Consistent with this objective, the village fathers
recognized the need for a transition from these communities to the west by
providing for a gradual decrease in density along portions of the western
border. Subsequent village annexations and land use decisions were consistent
with this pattern of decreasing density.
   (B)   This transition in intensity of development, and the topographical
characteristics described above, define two logical gradients in the village,
both of which generally flow from west to east. These two gradients are shown
in the land use map which is attached to this plan and made a part hereof. The
village has continued to serve as a natural and logical geographical area of
rural relief to the increasing sprawl of the Cincinnati suburbs. The village is
located along a major physical boundary, the Little Miami River, and its stream
valleys and steep ravines are ideally suited for low-density development. The
expanse of the village gives it an appropriate size for maintaining the desired
rural character and providing rural relief within the metropolitan area.
('80 Code, § 155.03) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.04 ROADWAY SYSTEM.
   (A)   Interstate highways (I-275, I-71) and major arterials run to the west,
north, east, and south of the village. The major arterials are Montgomery Road
(U.S. 22, State Route 3) and Wooster Pike (U.S. 50). Together, these interstate
highways and major arterials provide for needed regional access. Within the
village itself, there are only three minor arterials and one major collector
which are suitable for traffic movement between local streets and the regional
roadway network. Two of these minor arterials that run in an east-west
direction are Remington Road and Shawnee Run Road. The major collector, Indian
Hill Road, also runs in an east-west direction. The third minor arterial is
Loveland-Madeira. It angles through the village in a northeasterly direction.
These roads run past the boundaries of the village and intersect with the major
regional highways. Consequently, there is no need to use these roads to travel
through the village to reach other destinations within the metropolitan area.
These minor arterials and other roadways within the village should be
maintained and improved for the purpose of traffic safety but not to increase
capacity or to encourage their use by through traffic.
   (B)   Because of the existing roadway pattern, there are no logical roadway
corridors within the village that are suitable for more intense uses. The three
minor arterial roads and major collector all have rural cross-sections. Trees
and ditches are located close to the pavements. This condition provides for
pleasing, scenic views, but lowers the carrying capacity of these roads. The
low land use intensities proposed for the village are consistent with the low
volumes and low capacities of the road network. The existing roadway system,
therefore, is an important component of, and thus contributes to, the rural
quality the village seeks to maintain.
('80 Code, § 155.04) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.05 DENSITY PATTERN OF RESIDENTIAL LAND USE.
   (A)   In furtherance of its stated Charter objective of maintaining its
original rural character, the village adopted in 1983 specific land use
objectives and policies. These adopted "Land Use Objectives and Policies" (May
1983) are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this plan.
   (B)   The village is not only a rural community, but also a community of
single-family residences. As indicated in the land use map, the land use
pattern that will most effectively meet the village's adopted "Land Use
Objectives and Policies" is one which maintains the vast majority of the
community at a density of .2 dwelling units per acre (or five acres per
dwelling unit). This planned density is identified as "rural estate" on the
land use map. The rural estate area runs along the eastern border of the
village and becomes broader as it goes north. Along the western fork of
Sycamore Creek, the rural estate area is uninterrupted from the western to
eastern borders of the village. The broader area thus serves to protect the
majority of the Sycamore Creek area that dominates the northern portion of the
village. This density pattern, in conjunction with the implementation of the
village's adopted resource protection policies and careful attention to
landscape design, will insure the preservation of the village's rural character
as the dominant and unifying element of the village's land use plan.
   (C)   In addition, the plan shows a moderate area of one dwelling unit per
acre density which should be limited to the southwest area of the village where
it adjoins the City of Madeira, the City of Cincinnati, Columbia Township, and
the Village of Mariemont. This density is identified as "suburban estate" on
the land use map. North of the rural estate land surrounding Sycamore Creek,
two much smaller areas adjoining the City of Montgomery near Perin Road and
Spooky Ridge Lane are also designated for suburban estate on the land use map.
Adjoining the suburban estate land area in the southern part of the village
should be an area of .3 dwelling units per acre (three acres per dwelling
unit). This planned density is identified as "estate" on the land use map. The
plan shows much smaller areas of estate in the more rural northern portion of
the village, again generally surrounding the suburban estate, particularly
along Blome and Remington Roads. The suburban estate and estate land areas
represent a logical transition in intensity of land use to communities to the
west; however, they cannot be significantly expanded without causing an adverse
effect upon the rural community character of the village.
('80 Code, § 155.05) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.06 OTHER LAND USES.
   The only nonresidential areas in the village are schools (public and
private), municipal buildings, churches, and recreational or cultural
facilities. The introduction of commercial, office, or industrial uses into the
village would destroy its rural-residential character. The surrounding
jurisdictions of Montgomery, Kenwood, Madeira, and Milford provide adequate
shopping and other commercial services for the needs of the residents of the
village and of the surrounding area. The remoteness from congested commercial
centers is part of the rural living environment of the village. No commercial
uses, except necessary public utility buildings needed to serve the village
residents, should be permitted.
('80 Code, § 155.06) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.07 REGIONAL LAND USE FUNCTION.
   Because the village from its inception has acted to maintain its rural
character, the suburban growth and sprawl in the Cincinnati metropolitan area
has leapfrogged over the village. The rural enclave that the village has
preserved now serves an important regional function by preserving in open space
some of the rougher topographical areas of the region and enhancing the
character of the more densely settled surrounding communities. By breaking up
the relatively uniform pattern of suburban development in the metropolitan
area, the village provides needed contrast in land use and open space, and
thereby contributes to the rural quality of neighboring communities and the
region. Thus, these developed areas that surround the village are able to
"borrow" open space that has been preserved through the village's planning
policies. Residents of the adjoining unincorporated residential areas to the
northeast who choose to drive through the village on their way to and from work
benefit from the perception that they live in a more rural environment. These
benefits are obtained solely as the result of the village's land use policies.
('80 Code, § 155.07) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.08 CONSISTENCY OF LAND USE DECISIONS WITH PLAN.
   The land use plan is adopted by resolution of the City Council. Together
with the village's "Land Use Objectives and Policies" and the "Green Areas
Study", it is intended to provide a coherent land use planning framework for
the village's use in making land use decisions. The land use plan is advisory
only. However, by adoption of this plan, it is the City Council's intent that
the land use decision-making process shall include careful consideration of the
extent to which proposed land use changes are consistent with the land use
plan. The City Planning Commission shall consult the land use plan in
determining whether or not to grant special exceptions to the zoning code and
in making its findings of fact and recommendations to the City Council with
respect to zoning amendments. It is also the intent of the City Council that
the zoning code of the village, and any amendment to it, shall not be
inconsistent with the village's land use plan.
('80 Code, § 155.08) (Res. 15-86, passed 6-16-86)
§ 152.09 INTERPRETATION.
   Any question regarding the interpretation of this land use plan, as well as
its implementation, will be resolved by the City Council.

§ 153.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water
quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches
and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during
construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of these regulations is to safeguard persons,
protect property, and prevent damage to the environment in the Village of
Indian Hill. These regulations will also promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of
any development or other activity that disturbs or breaks the topsoil or
results in the movement of earth on land in the Village of Indian Hill.
(Ord. 12-20, passed 11-23-20)
§ 153.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   These regulations shall apply to any new development or redevelopment
construction activities that result in land disturbance greater than or equal
to 5,000 square feet. No person shall be granted a site development permit for
land-disturbing activity greater than or equal to 5,000 square feet without the
approval of an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the Village of Indian Hill.
   (B)   Construction activities disturbing one or more acres of total land or
will disturb less than one acre of land but are part of a larger common plan of
development or sale that will ultimately disturb one or more acres of land,
shall obtain coverage through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA)
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Construction General
Permit, latest version. The threshold acreage includes the entire area
disturbed in the larger common plan of development or sale. Erosion and
sediment controls or BMPs shall comply with the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) requirements prescribed in the OEPA NPDES Construction
General Permit, latest version.
   (C)   Erosion and sediment controls shall be selected and designed to be
consistent with standards and specifications included in the Ohio DNR Rainwater
and Land Development manual, latest edition.
   (D)   Construction activities that meet the applicability requirements
described above shall require approval from the Planning Commission as follows.
      (1)   No changes shall be made in the contour of the land; no grading,
excavating, removal, or destruction of the topsoil trees or other vegetative
cover of the land shall be commenced until such time that a plan for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation has been processed with and reviewed by the Planning
Commission or its duly authorized representative, or there has been a
determination by the Planning Commission or its duly authorized representative
that such plans are not required.
      (2)   No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless
there has been a plan approved by the Planning Commission or its duly
authorized representative that provides for minimizing erosion and sediment as
consistent with the intent of this chapter; or has been a determination by the
Planning Commission or its duly authorized representative that such plans are
not required. Where a plan is approved as herein provided no work of the type
described in division (A) above shall be done, except in accordance with the
approved plan.

VARIATIONS
§ 154.045 GENERAL.
   Where the Planning Commission finds that undue hardship or exceptional
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these
regulations, the Planning Commission may grant variations to the regulations so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided,
however, that such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter or the zoning code.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.046 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR VARIATIONS.
   The Planning Commission shall not grant variations to the regulations of
this chapter unless it shall make written findings of fact based upon the
evidence presented by each specific case that:
   (A)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would cause undue hardship or
exceptional
practical difficulty to the applicant, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, or would conflict with the village's adopted land use plan, if
the provisions of this chapter were strictly enforced;
   (B)   The conditions upon which the request for a variation is based are
unusual to the property for which the variation is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;
   (C)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to
obtain additional income from the property;
   (D)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety or general welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;
   (E)   The special circumstances or conditions are created by the provisions
or requirements of this chapter and have not resulted from any act of the
applicant or applicant's predecessor in interest; and
   (F)   The variation requested is the minimum adjustment necessary for the
reasonable use of the land.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.047 STANDARDS FOR VARIATIONS INVOLVING MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS OF NEIGHBORHOOD
SIZE.
   Where a major subdivision large enough to constitute a self-contained
neighborhood is proposed with a comprehensive plan for the site and, in the
judgment of the Commission, such comprehensive plan makes adequate provisions
for essential community requirements and proposes reasonable modifications to
the standards of this chapter to accommodate the unusual size of the
subdivision, the Commission may grant variations to the regulations of this
chapter by making findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it
which support written conclusions that:
   (A)   The conditions upon which the request for variation is based are
unusual to the property for which each variation is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;
   (B)   The purpose of the requested variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to obtain additional income from or add value to the property;
   (C)   The granting of the requested variation will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety or general welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located, nor conflict
with the village's adopted land use plan;
   (D)   The special circumstances or conditions are created by the provisions
or requirements of this chapter and have not resulted from any act of the
applicant or applicant's predecessor in interest;
   (E)   Each variation requested is the minimum adjustment necessary for the
reasonable use of the land; and
   (F)   The variation requested will not conflict with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.048 CONDITIONS.

as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards
or requirements of these regulations.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.049 PROCEDURES.
   A petition for any such variation shall be submitted in writing by the
subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for consideration by
the Planning Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

public rights in the streets, alleys, and public grounds, and all dedications
laid out or described in such plat.
   (D)   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner
provided in this chapter by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the
execution of such instrument.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.061 PROCEDURE FOR RESUBDIVISION.
   For any change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat, if such
change affects any street layout shown on such map, or area reserved thereon
for public use, or any lot line, or if it affects any map or plan legally
established prior to the adoption of any regulations controlling subdivisions,
such parcel shall be approved by the Planning Com-mission by the same
procedure, rules, and regulations as for a subdivision, except as otherwise
provided pursuant to the procedures set forth in §
155.08.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.062 PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVISIONS WHERE FUTURE RESUBDIVISION IS INDICATED.
   Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one
or more lots containing greater than two times the minimum lot size for the
applicable zoning district and there are indications or the possibility that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building sites, the
Planning Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future
opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements
providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a
requirement of the plat.

IMPROVEMENTS GUARANTEE; CONTROL OF CONSTRUCTION
§ 154.070 GENERAL.
   In order to assure that growth in the village will be orderly and to further
provide for the installation of all required improvements, public or private,
in newly developed areas, no final plat shall be recorded until the
requirements of this subchapter have been met.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.071 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE FOR SUBDIVISION WITHIN THE VILLAGE LIMITS.
   Before recording of an approved final plat, a performance guarantee
acceptable to the village must be provided as required in this chapter. One of
the following options for guarantee of improvement completion shall be
utilized:
   (A)   Cash escrow.
      (1)   Establishing account. An escrow account in the amount required
shall be established with a financial institution (hereinafter referred to as
the escrowee) which meets the approval of the City Manager. The account shall
be administered by the escrowee in accordance with the provisions of an escrow
agreement to be negotiated by the City Manager and the owner, and/or subdivider
and approved by the City Solicitor. Such agreement shall contain provisions for
specific application of such funds; partial contract payments; contract
retention percentages until completion; prorated reduction of deposit excess;
final escrow settlement; and other pertinent administrative matters as may be
required.
      (2)   Fund disbursement. The escrowee shall disburse funds from time to
time for the purposes provided upon presentation of, and in accordance with,
payout orders issued by the owner's/subdivider's engineer and approved by the
City Engineer. Such disbursements shall not be subject to approval or
disapproval by the owner/subdivider or escrowee or their agents other than the
owner/subdivider's engineer; however, for accounting purposes, the village
shall send to the owner/subdivider a copy of the approved engineer's estimate
for payment at time of village approval. Each payout order shall be accompanied
by all appropriate sworn statements, affidavits and supporting waivers of lien
in full compliance with the Ohio Mechanics Lien Law.
      (3)   Excess fund balance. If, at any time, the City Manager shall notify
escrowee in writing that the balance of funds then remaining undisbursed under
said escrow account is more than sufficient to cover the cost of construction
fees and maintenance hereinabove provided, which said notice shall specify the
reduced balance then deemed sufficient, and if escrowee shall concur in such
determination, escrowee shall pay over to the owner any excess of funds over
such reduced balance then remaining undisbursed under said escrow account.
   (B)   Letter of credit. The owner/subdivider may file a straight, commercial
letter of credit from any financial institution acceptable to the City Manager
and the City Solicitor in a form acceptable to the City Solicitor. The letter
of credit shall be in an amount, determined by the City Manager, sufficient to
pay for the cost of construction of the improvements and all engineering costs,
including the engineering and inspection fees of the village. The letter of
credit must provide that the issuing financial institution will pay to the
village, or as the village directs, such amounts as may be required to complete
the improvements according to the approved specifications. The letter of credit
should provide that its amount will be reduced from time to time as payments
for improvements approved by the City Manager are made. The letter of credit
shall be irrevocable for at least six months and must provide that if any
balance remains at the expiration of any time limit placed on it, said balance
will be deposited with the village in a cash escrow or a new letter of credit
in the amount of the unpaid balance will be issued or a surety bond as
prescribed in division (D) will be provided.
   (C)   Insufficient fund balance. If, at any time before the construction of
all required improvements has been completed, the balance of funds remaining
undisbursed under said escrow account or letter of credit is not sufficient, in
the sole judgment of the City Manager, to cover the cost of construction of
said improvements and all engineering costs including the engineering and
inspection fees of the village, or if by reason of any order, decree or writ of
any court, or for any other reason, the said undisbursed balance of funds shall
be withheld, diminished or otherwise unavailable for the purpose provided in
this chapter, the owner/subdivider agrees to cause the balance to be increased
to such amount as shall be required by the village for such purposes, in the
exercise of its judgment, or shall provide such other guarantee of performance
as may be required by the village.
   (D)   Surety bond.
      (1)   Form. The bond shall be in a form and with a bonding company, and
approved by the City Solicitor.
      (2)   Time limit. The bond shall be payable to the City of the Village of
Indian Hill and be enforceable by same on or beyond a date 36 months from the
date of final plat approval.
      (3)   Release of any bond required herein shall be conditioned on final
approval and acceptance of the improvements by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.072 TIME LIMIT.
   All performance guarantees shall provide that if required improvements are
not installed within two years of approval of the final plat, the village may
deem the subdivider in default and proceed in accordance with the provisions of
§
154.073.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.073 DEFAULT.
   In the event the City Manager determines, in the sole exercise of his
judgment, that the owner/ subdivider has failed to install the proposed
improvements in accordance with the approved plans and specifications or has
failed to comply with the terms of the guarantees hereinabove set forth, the
village may take the following actions:
   (A)   Cash escrow and letter of credit. The village may advise the owner/
subdivider of failure in writing, giving the same 30 days to cure such default.
If the owner/subdivider fails to cure said default, it is agreed that the
village may, at its option, declare him in default and, upon written
notification to escrowee of such declaration of default, all monies on deposit
pursuant to the escrow agreement shall and may be disbursed by escrowee solely
upon authorization of the City Manager and escrowee shall be released by the
said owner/subdivider as to such payment or payments.
   (B)   Surety bond. The village may inform the bonding company of default by
the owner and request they take necessary actions to complete the required
subdivision improvements.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.074 GUARANTEE AMOUNT.
   The amount of the performance guarantee shall cover all construction costs,
the owner's engineering and platting costs, and the village's engineering and
inspection costs. The guarantees shall be in the following minimum amounts
unless the owner can show that certain of the costs have already been paid.
   (A)   Construction cost:
      (1)   130% of the estimated construction cost approved by the City
Manager; or
      (2)   110% of a binding contract with a contractor qualified for the
proposed work.
   (B)   Owner's engineering and platting cost: at a cost verified by the
engineer and surveyor.
   (C)   Village Engineering and inspection costs: actual costs incurred.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.075 MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   The owner/subdivider shall guarantee public improvements required by this
chapter against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of two years
from the date of acceptance of public improvements by the village. The owner/
subdivider agrees to repair or replace any of said public improvements which,
during said two year period after acceptance, shall become damaged or deficient
due to defective materials or workmanship.
   (A)   Conditions of guarantee. The owner/ subdivider shall establish a cash
escrow account or provide a letter of credit in the amount of 5% of the final
construction costs of the improvements to guarantee cost of replacement of
defective materials within the limits of the improvements. Said escrow account
or letter of credit shall remain in force for the aforesaid two year
maintenance period and shall be for use by the village to effect such repairs
deemed necessary for public safety and which the owner has neglected to repair
for a 48 hour period after notification. Disbursements from the cash escrow
account or pursuant to the letter of credit shall be made solely upon the
direction of the village and shall not be subject to approval or disapproval by
the owner/subdivider or escrowee or the financial institution issuing the
letter of credit or their agents.
   (B)   Return of funds. Within 45 days following the two year maintenance
period, the escrowee or the financial institution issuing the letter of credit
shall pay over to the owner/subdivider, without further demand or notice, any
balance of funds then remaining undisbursed under said letter of credit or
escrow account.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89)
§ 154.076 DAMAGE AND NUISANCE GUARANTEE.
   The guarantee of completion of public improvements, to be executed prior to
recording of a final plat of subdivision, shall also provide for repair of
damages and abatement of nuisances with respect to existing and subsequently
installed landscaping, streets, lighting, water and sanitary sewerage
facilities, culverts, catch basins and/or storm sewers. The damage and nuisance
guarantee herein referred to shall be in the total of 5% of the construction
cost of the new public improvements and shall be provided by cash escrow
agreement, letter of credit or surety bond as provided in §
154.070 through
154.078 upon commencement of land development.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.077 CONSTRUCTION CONTROL.
   (A)   Time of construction of improvements. All public and private
improvements required pursuant to this chapter shall be installed after
approval of the final plat. No work shall start prior to said approval.
   (B)   Time of construction of buildings. No building permits shall be issued
for the construction of any building or structure unless a final plat has been
approved and recorded and unless all public improvements are provided to serve
the subdivision in the manner and in accordance with the standards set forth in
this chapter, provided, however, that permits may be issued if all grading
operations and drainage improvements are completed and the base and
intermediate layers of bituminous concrete have been placed on the road or
roads to be improved.
   (C)   Use of existing streets. Only those streets designated by the City
Manager during the approval of the final plat may be used for access to the
subdivision by all equipment and trucks engaged in the construction of all
improvements, utility services and buildings.
   (D)   Sequence of construction. All underground utilities, water mains,
sanitary sewers or storm sewers installed in streets or service roads shall be
installed prior to the surfacing of such streets. Service connections to such
underground utilities and sewers shall be extended to the property line of each
lot so as to prevent disturbing the surface improvements in such public ways
when service connections are later made. Where underground utilities are
located in the parkway adjacent to the paved roadway, service connections to
properties across such roads shall only be made by drilling under the pavement
in such a way that the surfacing is not disturbed or weakened.
   (E)   Maintenance during construction. The owner/subdivider shall clean and
maintain all public ways, sewers and drains free from snow, mud, debris and
trash or other extraneous material prior to acceptance of the street by the
village and at such other times during construction as the City Manager or
Village Engineer may deem necessary in accordance with Section 7.7.10 [sic] of
the Village Code.
   (F)   (1)   Erosion, sedimentation measures and maintenance requirements
during construction. Pursuant to Chapter 153, sediment basins, diversions,
sediment barriers, and other measures intended to trap sediment on-site shall
be constructed as a first step in grading and be made functional before land
disturbance takes place.
      (2)   Temporary stabilization of denuded areas, soil stock piles and all
other requirements of the approved Erosion and Sedimentation Plan shall be in
accordance with the design standards of the Hamilton County Soil and Water
Conservation District.

§ 154.078 INSPECTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   General. Unless otherwise specifically provided, inspection of the
construction of the improvements shall be by the village and paid for by the
subdivider.
   (B)   (1)   Inspection required. All required land improvements to be
installed under the provisions of this chapter shall be inspected at the
subdivider's expense. The subdivider's licensed engineer, as agent for the
subdivider, shall provide an inspector on the job during the process of
construction. When the work has been completed, the subdivider's engineer shall
certify that the improvements comply in all respects with the approved plans
and specifications and with the requirements of this chapter. All work shall be
at all times subject to inspection by the City Manager, the Village Engineer,
other village officials, and their representatives.
      (2)   In the event the village elects to provide inspection of
subdivision construction, the cost of the village inspector shall be determined
in accordance with the current subdivision fee schedule. One-half of the cost
of inspection shall be paid at the time of execution of the final subdivision
plat. The remaining one-half of the inspection cost is to be paid prior to the
final release from the subdivider's guarantee of improvement completion. In the
event the actual cost of engineering services to the village shall exceed the
amounts computed under the subdivision fee schedule, such excess shall be paid
by the subdivider to the village upon final inspection for acceptance and
release of subdivider's completion guarantee.
   (C)   Notification. Before starting the construction of any improvements,
the subdivider shall ascertain from the City Manager what inspections are
required and the amount of notification desired in each case. In no event shall
notice to the Village Engineer be less than 48 hours prior to a desired
inspection.
   (D)   Subdivider's responsibility. Regardless of contracts, agreements or
inspections performed, final responsibility for the installation of all
improvements in accordance with the applicable standards rests with the
subdivider.
   (E)   Time limit on construction of public improvements. All improvements
required under the provisions of this chapter shall be completed within two
years of approval of a final plat or the subdivider shall be considered in
default under the provisions of §
154.073.

ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS; RELEASE OF PERFORMANCE SURETY
§ 154.085 ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   If any plat of subdivision contains public streets or easements which are
dedicated thereon as such, whether located within the corporate limits of the
village or in part outside thereof, or contains existing streets located
outside of the corporate limits, approval of the final plat by the Planning
Commission, approval of payouts under the terms of a guarantee of improvement,
or subsequent annexation of the property to the village shall not constitute an
acceptance by the village of such streets or easements, nor of the public
improvements constructed or installed thereon or therein, irrespective of any
act by any officer, agent or employee of the village with respect to such
streets or improvements. The acceptance of all public improvements shall be
made only by the adoption of an ordinance by the Village Council after there
has been filed with the Council a certification by the City Manager stating
that all, or individual, public improvements required to be constructed or
installed have been fully, or individually, completed, and that the
construction or installation has been approved by him.

said improvements, the subdivider shall make or cause to be made "as built"
drawings showing the actual location of all improvements. The plan shall be in
black ink on mylar or materials of equal permanence and durability and shall
bear the seal and signature of the subdivider's engineer. The plans consisting
of the original drawings and three sets of blue line prints shall be submitted

SUBDIVISION STANDARDS
§ 154.095 GENERAL.
   All subdivisions in the village shall comply with the minimum standards set
forth in this chapter, the zoning code and all other applicable regulations of
the village. All land improvements proposed in a subdivision, including
building areas of lots, streets, storm drainage, public utilities, sewers, site
grading, and the like shall be constructed within the clearable land area
calculated pursuant to §
154.110 through
154.116 and the appendix to this chapter.
(Ord. 25-89, passed 9-25-89; Am. Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.096 LOT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Lot dimensions; area and setbacks. Lot dimensions, area, and set backs
shall comply with the requirements of the zoning code of the village, as
amended from time to time, for the zoning district in which the property is
situated. Lots shall not block any street extensions which have been set forth
on the official (street) map of the village.
   (B)   Lot abutment.
      (1)   Every lot of a subdivision shall abut on a publicly-dedicated
street or a private street, provided, however, that the Planning Commission may
approve a subdivision, the lots of which do not abut on a publicly-dedicated
street or a private street ("rear lots") if:
         (a)   The rear lot or lots abut on a lot, which in turn abuts on:
            1.   An existing public street; or
            2.   A private street which complies with §
154.097 (B) and (E), or an existing private street which is determined by the
Planning Commission to be of such construction and width and has such other
characteristics as satisfy the purposes of this section;
         (b)   The rear lot or lots are served by an unobstructed easement not
less than 40 feet in width which connects such rear lot or lots with the
existing public or private street described in division (B)(1) above; and
         (c)   The rear lots permit more efficient lotting and avoid the
construction of a street in an environmentally sensitive area.
      (2)   Rear lots shall not be approved if the Planning Commission shall
determine that their primary purpose is to avoid the construction of a public
street, that such lots would create a safety hazard, or that such lots would be
inconsistent with the village's adopted land use objectives and policies.
   (C)   Double-frontage lots. Double-frontage lots and reversed-frontage lots
are not permitted, except in such instances where such a lot arrangement will
avoid the construction of lots that face on principal or secondary streets.
   (D)   Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
or radial to the right-of-way line of the street on which the lot faces.
   (E)   Corner lots. In order to permit conformance with the front yard depth
on the side street required by the zoning ordinance, a corner lot shall be
platted 50 feet wider than the minimum frontage required for interior lots by
the applicable zoning district.
   (F)   Remnant parcels. No remnants of property shall be left which do not
conform to all lot requirements, unless such remnant parcels are accepted by
the village for public purposes.

afforded by either a dedicated public street or a private street. Private
streets will be considered by the Planning Commission depending on site
suitability, provided that a binding agreement contained in the plat or other
recorded or registered document shall assure the continued existence and
maintenance of said street or access.
      (2)   Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment or continuation
of existing streets already named shall bear the name of such existing streets
whether in the village or in unincorporated areas. In no case shall the names
for proposed streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use
of a suffix (such as street, road, boulevard, drive, place or court, and the
like) or an abbreviation thereof. Street names shall be approved by the
Planning Commission which shall keep a list of all street names in the village.
      (3)   No permanent building or structure or permanent improvement of any
type shall be erected within the extension of street rights-of-way indicated on
the official [street] map of the village.
      (4)   As far as practicable, all proposed streets shall be continuous and
in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to
connect.
      (5)   Proposed rights-of-way for streets shall be extended to the
boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or
other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Commission, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision with the existing layout, or the most advantageous future
development, of adjacent tracts. Cul-de-sac streets of reasonable length will
be approved where necessitated by topography or where, in the opinion of the
Commission, they are appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
      (6)   Proposed streets shall follow contour lines wherever practicable.
      (7)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permits and
where sight distance is sufficient for traffic safety.

vertical curves of a minimum length equal to 15 times the algebraic dif-ference
in the rate of grade, for principal village streets, and one-half of this
minimum for all other streets. A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be
provided between reversed curves. In areas of sensitive natural resources, the
horizontal alignment of minor streets may be varied by the Planning Commission
to avoid the destruction of mature trees or other important natural features.
      (2)   Intersections shall conform to the following standards:
         (a)   At street intersections property line corners shall be rounded
by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be ten feet.
         (b)   Street curb or street pavement intersections shall be rounded by
radii of at least 25 feet.
         (c)   The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest
angle of intersection is less than 60 degrees, or in any case where the
Commission considers an increase necessary.

   (G)   Signs. Street name signs will be erected by the village at all
intersections created by the development. Customized or specially designed
street signs may be erected by the developer in lieu of village signs, provided
that the sign face material and design are in accordance with current village
standards and are approved by the village. Ornamental entranceway structures,
as permitted by §
155.08 of the zoning code, may be erected at street entrances. Such
entranceways, however, shall not include the name of the subdivision.
   (H)   Special soil regulations for streets.
      (1)   Organic soils. If during the construction of proposed streets or
roads in a subdivision organic soils are discovered, all organic materials
shall be removed to solid subsoil in the area of the proposed street or road
and replaced with fill materials that allow movement of ground water in its
natural state through the fill and provides the required structural support for
the roadway. All such streets shall be elevated above the expected high water
in the area, as determined by the soils summary pursuant to §
154.036 (B)(6), so as to provide a minimum of two feet between the pavement
surface and the water. In no instance shall the pavement base course be
constructed within six inches of the expected high water.
      (2)   Wet soils. If the construction of proposed streets and roads in a
subdivision is to go through wet soils, positive ground water control must be
achieved. The surface of all roads shall be constructed at an elevation so as
to provide a minimum of two feet between the pavement surface and expected high
ground water or free water surface. In no instance shall the pavement base
course be constructed within six inches of expected high water, as determined
by a report certified by the subdivider's engineer. All designs shall insure
that natural drainage is maintained. In no instance shall movement of ground
water be impeded so as to promote build-up of hydrostatic pressure on one side
or the other of a proposed roadway.

Drainage Manual, latest version.
   (B)   Construction activities disturbing 5,000 square feet or more of total
land shall be required to implement post-construction storm water management
facilities or best management practices (BMPs). Construction activities
disturbing one or more acres of total land, or will disturb less than one acre
of land but are part of a larger common plan of development or sale that will
ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, shall obtain coverage through the
OEPA NPDES Construction General Permit, latest version. The threshold acreage
includes the entire area disturbed in the larger common plan of development or
sale. Post-construction storm water management facilities or BMPs shall comply
with the post-construction storm water management requirements prescribed in
the Ohio EPA General Storm Water Permit for Construction Activities.
   (C)   Post-construction storm water management facilities and BMPs that have
been reviewed and approved by the Village of Indian Hill shall be required to
enter into a maintenance agreement following construction to ensure adequate

§ 154.116 PRESERVATION OF RESOURCE PROTECTION AREAS.
   (A)   Designation and use. Resource protection areas that are identified
pursuant to §
154.113,
154.114, and
154.115 shall be designated on the final plat of subdivision as such and in no
case shall designated resource protection areas be developed. Land which is
designated as a resource protection area pursuant to this section shall be used
for resource protection and such other purposes as the Planning Commission
shall approve and authorize to be designated on the final plat, subject to such
conditions as the Commission may deem appropriate. Access to land designated
strictly for resource protection shall be restricted in order to ensure such
protection. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no area occupied by
structures, roads, road rights-of-way or parking areas shall be counted as
designated resource protection areas.
   (B)   Methods of preservation. Resource protection areas shall be designated
so their use and enjoyment as natural areas is not obstructed. The form of
ownership of resource protection areas shall be designated on the final plat.
Resource protection areas shall be owned and preserved by either of the
following two methods or a combination thereof:
      (1)   Conveyance of the resource protection areas to the village as
trustee of and under the Green Areas and Recreational Fund pursuant to §
155.08(F) for which the developer may qualify for a credit on the clearable
land area pursuant to the appendix to this chapter, and/or a special exception
to required minimum lot sizes pursuant to §
155.08; or
      (2)   Deed restricted private ownership which shall prohibit in
perpetuity the development and/or subsequent subdivision of the resource
protection areas or their use for purposes other than those specified in §
154.116. The responsibility and standards for all resource protection areas
shall be specified and provision shall be made for guaranteeing such
responsibility.
   (C)   Clearable land area. The acreage of clearable land identified in the
appendix to this chapter may be combined with resource protection areas, minus
the public or private street rights-of-way, for the purpose of calculating the
number of lots permitted on a parcel under the applicable district regulations
pursuant to §
155.07, provided, however, that the combined total acreage of all areas
clearable for development on the parcel shall not exceed the clearable land
area as calculated pursuant to the appendix to this chapter.
   (D)   Procedures required for on-site improvements. Prior to commencing
improvements on a site on which resource protection areas have been designated
pursuant to §
154.113,
154.114, and
154.115, the owner/subdivider shall stake off and install a barrier fence along
the designated resource protection areas. Any owner/subdivider who fails to
comply with this provision prior to commencement of improvements on the site,
or fails to maintain fenced off areas on the site during such improvements,
shall be subject to a fine pursuant to the provisions of §
154.999 for each day on which improvements were performed in violation of this
section. An owner/subdivider found guilty of such a violation, which has also
resulted in the destruction of designated resource protection areas, shall, in
addition, be liable for the costs of restoring such resource protection areas
to their natural condition.

GREEN AREAS GIFTS AND BRIDLE TRAIL EASEMENTS
§ 154.120 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the green areas gift program is to protect the village's
natural resource areas ranging from flat, open, grassy fields to steeply sloped
forests in a creative manner as to benefit both developers and the residents of
the village. The purpose of the bridle trail easement program is to provide
licensed bridle trail riders the opportunity to safely enjoy safe access
through these natural resource areas.
(Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.121 GENERAL INTENTION.
   Developers are encouraged to make green areas gifts to the village and
designate land to be included in the bridle trail system. Land proposed for a
bridle trail easement should serve as a natural extension to existing green
areas and enable the provision of a ten foot wide easement that will supplement
the existing bridle trail system.
(Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.122 CREDITS.
   Developers who donate land to the village as a green areas gift or designate
land as part of a bridle trail easement may be given a credit to the clearable
land area calculated pursuant to the appendix to this chapter.
(Ord. 03-97, passed 2-24-97)
§ 154.123 ACCEPTANCE REQUIRED.
   Proposed green areas gifts and bridle trail easements must be accepted by
the Planning Commission and Village Council before any credit is granted to the
developer.

         (k)   Such additional information as the Commission may, in its sole
discretion, require.
      (3)   The Commission may, upon the request of the applicant, waive the
submission of any of the information required by division (D)(2) of this
section if, in its sole discretion, the Commission believes the information is
not necessary to make its decision on the special exception application for the
co-location on a previously approved PWS facility, on an existing tower, or on
an existing support structure.
   (E)   Standards for approval of a PWS facility. The Commission shall not
grant a special exception for a PWS facility unless the applicant has clearly
demonstrated by substantial evidence in the record that it has complied with
the standards set forth below. In each case, the Commission shall make written
findings of fact and conclusions directly based on and supported by the record
presented to it in the application and at the hearing.
      (1)   For a PWS facility for co-location or for a PWS facility on an
existing tower or on an existing support structure, the Commission must find
that the application complies with the following standards.
         (a)   The applicant has complied with the special exception standards
set forth in §
155.08 and
155.10 of the zoning ordinance.
         (b)   The applicant has complied with the submission requirements of §
156.04(D)(2) above;
         (c)   The PWS facility is not inconsistent with the land use
objectives and policies adopted by the village;
         (d)   The PWS facility is in compliance with all applicable
requirements of the zoning ordinance;
         (e)   All antennas mounted on or within an existing support structure
are adequately screened, painted, and/or architecturally treated so as to blend
into the proposed or existing architectural character of the structure. To the
extent possible, equipment associated with PWS facilities on existing support
structures shall be located within the support structure. If a new equipment
shelter is included as a part of a PWS facility, it shall have an appearance
consistent with other buildings or structures on the parcel and will preserve
the character of the village as a rural neighborhood of homes, green open
spaces, and farms;
         (f)   The PWS facility use will not substantially diminish or impair
property values within the neighborhood;
         (g)   The PWS facility use will have adequate access to utilities and
public roads and shall provide adequate space for on-site parking.
         (h)   All exterior lighting fixtures will be designed, directed, or
shaded so that no direct light is cast upon any other property;
         (i)   The PWS facility use and its associated uses and structures are
adequately landscaped in a manner consistent with the principle and accessory
use of the site and the provisions of the land use objectives and policies.
         (j)   The PWS facility complies with the RF emission standards adopted
by the FCC.
         (k)   The PWS facility complies with the performance standards set
forth in §
156.04(F).
      (2)   A proposed PWS facility which will require the construction of a
new tower shall comply with the standards set forth in §
156.04(D)(1) above and the following additional standards.
         (a)   The area proposed to be serviced by the PWS facility cannot be
adequately addressed by the establishment of a PWS facility on an existing
tower or an existing support structure.
         (b)   The use of an existing tower is not technically, structurally,
economically, and/or financially feasible.
         (c)   The proposed facility has adequate capacity to handle a maximum
of three additional users.
         (d)   No federal or state government land is available for the siting
of the proposed PWS facility.
         (e)   All towers shall maintain a galvanized finish or shall be
painted a neutral color, consistent with the natural or built environment of
the site.
         (f)   All obstruction lighting and/or marking required by the FAA
shall be approved by the Commission at the time the application is made.
         (g)   Ground anchors associated with any guyed towers shall be located
on the same parcel as the tower and shall satisfy the setback requirements for
structures in that district.
   (3)   The Commission at its discretion, may retain an outside consultant to
assist it in its evaluation of the special exception application for a PWS
facility. The cost for such consulting services shall be borne by the applicant
and shall be collected as a part of the application fee. The applicant shall
not be entitled to a return of this fee if the application is denied.
   (F)   Thoroughfare proximity areas performance standards. For the purpose of
this chapter only, a location proposed for a PWS facility which satisfies all
of the following standards shall be deemed to be within the limits of the
thoroughfare proximity areas:
      (1)   The proposed PWS facility shall be no closer than 250 feet nor
further than 1,500 feet from the closest right-of-way line associated with any
principal street in the village.
      (2)   The proposed PWS Facility site must be located in an area which
maintains a ground elevation of at least 650 feet above mean sea level (AMSL).
      (3)   No portion of the proposed PWS facility site compound is within 250
feet from any existing single family residential structure on the same parcel
or adjacent parcels.
      (4)   Any tower associated with the proposed PWS facility shall satisfy
the setback requirement of §
156.06(E).
   (G)   Presumption favoring thoroughfare proximity areas. It is presumed, for
the purposes of this chapter, that PWS facilities in the village can be located
in the established thoroughfare proximity areas. The Com-mission may approve a
special exception application for a PWS facility in an area outside of the
thorough-fare proximity areas if, in addition to satisfying the standards set
forth in division (E) of this section, the applicant can demonstrate that
absolutely no site location within the thoroughfare proximity areas can satisfy
its technical coverage needs. The Commission may require the submission of such
additional information as it deems necessary to determine that no site in the
thoroughfare proximity areas exists that will satisfy the reasonable coverage
needs of the PWS provider.
The PWS provider's inability to agree on acceptable terms with a property owner
for the use of his/her parcel shall not, in and of itself, be an acceptable
reason for failing to propose a PWS facility on a parcel within the
thoroughfare proximity areas.
(Ord. 12-97, passed 7-14-97)
§ 156.05 CO-LOCATION.
   (A)   In an effort to avoid the proliferation of PWS facilities in the
village, the village has established, as a part of its land use objectives and
policies, a clear policy in favor of co-location. Each tower proposed as a part
of a PWS facility shall be required to accommodate a maximum of three
additional personal wireless service providers and shall make space available
on the tower to federal, state, and local emergency service providers as
requested.
   (B)   Following the issuance of an approval of a special exception for a PWS
facility, and prior to the issuance of a building permit for the construction
of a tower, the applicant shall enter into a written agreement with the village
committing to make the approved tower available to additional users. The
willful and knowing misrepresentation and the subsequent failure of the
applicant to construct the tower and act in accordance with the approval, the
signed co-location agreement, and the village's co-location policy is unlawful
and shall, among other remedies of the village, including the revocation of the
special exception permit, be cause for the withholding of future permits for
similar facilities and PWS facilities within the village. The applicant shall
agree to make its tower available to other PWS providers on reasonable terms
and conditions.
   (C)   A PWS provider who is denied access to a PWS facility tower previously
approved under this chapter may petition the Commission to review its request
to use the existing PWS facility tower. The Commission may hold a hearing, at
which all parties shall appear, to determine whether the requested co-location
is technically, legally, and economically feasible and to determine if the
permittee is in breach of its agreement with the village to permit such co-
location. Upon finding that co-location on an existing PWS facility tower is
technically, legally, and economically feasible and/or upon a finding that the
permittee is in breach of its co-location agreement, the Commission may act in
accordance with the remedies set forth in division (B) of this section. All
costs associated with the Commission's review and mediation of co-location
disputes shall be shared equally by the petitioner and the permittee.
(Ord. 12-97, passed 7-14-97)
§ 156.06 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Parking. A maximum of two parking spaces may be provided at a PWS
facility.
   (B)   Landscaping.
      (1)   Each site approved for use as a PWS facility shall be suitably
landscaped. It is the intent of these landscape provisions to establish visual
screening of all structures or equipment associated with the facility and
located within the site compound. This landscaped area shall consist of a
minimum ten-foot wide landscaped strip around the entire site compound for new
tower sites or landscaping consistent with the principal use of the site for
PWS facilities utilizing existing support structures. At the discretion of the
Commission, this landscape requirement may be waived for PWS facilities on
existing support structures.
      (2)   The applicant shall propose a mix of tree, shrubs, and ground cover
to provide adequate screening of all structures and equipment within the site
compound, excluding any tower structure but including any fence or wall
surrounding the site compound. Landscaping requirement may be varied at the
discretion of the Commission as site specific conditions dictate.
   (C)   Maintenance and removal.
      (1)   The owner/operator of an approved PWS facility shall be responsible
for the maintenance of the site compound, associated landscaping, access
driveway, and any associated areas of the property used as a part of the PWS
facility.
      (2)   Any PWS facility tower which has discontinued its service as
authorized by special exception for a period of 12 continuous months shall be
dismantled and removed from the site at the owner's expense. The Commission
shall provide the PWS facility operator with notice to remove the tower within
90 days after receipt of such notice. For the purpose of this section, a tower
shall be deemed to have discontinued its service as authorized by special
exception if it has been abandoned, becomes obsolete, or ceased to be used or
operated on a daily basis.
      (3)   As a condition of the Commission's approval of a PWS facility
tower, the owner of the property upon which the PWS facility tower is located
shall be required to submit to the Commission the owner's covenant to undertake
the responsibility and cost for the removal of a PWS facility tower, which
covenant shall be made enforceable by the village and recorded as a lien
against the property. This lien shall be released after tower removal and final
inspection and sign off by the City Manager or its designee.
   (D)   Fences and walls. Each PWS facility requiring the construction of a
new tower shall be surrounded by an eight-foot high fence/wall and gate
adequate to provide vehicular access to the base of the tower and the equipment
shelter. The type, style, and the material of the proposed fence/wall shall be
approved by the Commission as a part of the special exception application
process. The fence/wall shall be installed along the perimeter of the site
compound. The Commission may in its sole discretion impose these fence/wall
requirements on PWS facilities utilizing existing support structures.
   (E)   Setbacks. Towers associated with a PWS facility shall be set back from
all property lines a distance equal to the height of the tower. All other
structures or equipment associated with a PWS facility must comply with the
appropriate setback requirements of the zoning ordinance.
   (F)   Tower height. No tower shall exceed 160 feet in height. However, the
Commission may approve a special exception for a new tower whose proposed
height exceeds 160 feet upon making written findings of fact and conclusions
that the additional height allowed will further the village's policy to
encourage co-location of PWS facilities.
   (G)   Modifications. Any modification to PWS facility approved under this
chapter shall require the submission of a new special exception application in
accordance with the provisions and requirements of §
156.04. The Commission may agree to waive certain submission requirements if,
at its discretion, the Commission believes such a waiver is justified.
   (H)   Prohibitions. No PWS facility shall be located in any village green
areas, as designated on the green areas map on file in the City Manager's
office. In addition, no PWS facility tower shall be illuminated in any manner
unless such illumination is required by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA).
   (L)   Transferability. Special exception approvals for the development and
operation of PWS facilities may be transferred only after the Commission's
receipt, at least 60 days prior to the transfer, of the notice of the
applicant's intent to transfer and upon review and approval of the Commission
at their next regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the transfer
notice.
