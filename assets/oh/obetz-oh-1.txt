ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER THEREIN; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Obetz, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Council of the Village of Obetz as
follows:
   Section 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Obetz, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into

enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Obetz, Ohio, 1979.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Obetz, Ohio.
   Section 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to April 15, 1979, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

Codified Ordinances, the Clerk of Council shall post copies of the Codified

the sections contain new matter ordained by this Adopting Ordinance.

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10, indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)

they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   Pursuant to Revised Charter Section 8.02(b) and Ordinance 52-11, a threshold
amount of $150,000 is established for competitive bidding.
   (a)    Current Competitive Bidding Threshold or More. For the award of

bidding and legislative authorization shall be required, unless an exception or
alternative is otherwise provided by Council.

competitive bidding set forth in this chapter are deemed to be in the best
interest of the Village.
   (a)   No or Rejected Bids.  If no bids are received after the advertisements
or other solicitations required by this chapter, or if all bids are rejected,
the Village Administrator shall have the authority to either seek new,
competitive bids, or to obtain the goods and/or services for which funds have
been appropriated through competitive bargaining without further legislative
authorization, whichever is deemed to be in the best interest of the Village.
   (b)   Used Equipment or Utilities. Regarding contracts for the purchase of
used equipment or utilities such as gas, water, electricity, or telephone
service for which funds have been appropriated, the Administrator shall have
the authority to enter into contracts through competitive bargaining without
further legislative authorization.
   (c)    Professional Services. Contracts for professional services are not
subject to competitive bidding requirements and shall not require further
legislative authorization where there are adequate unencumbered appropriations
for that purpose.
   (d)   Cooperative Purchasing Programs.  As an alternative to both
competitive bidding and competitive bargaining, the Administrator shall have
the authority to obtain goods and/or services for which funds have been
appropriated through cooperative purchasing programs without further
legislative authorization. As part of any cooperative purchasing program, the
Administrator may agree that the Village will be bound by contract terms and
conditions prescribed by that program, including, without limitation, payment
of a reasonable fee by the Village to cover the administrative costs incurred
by the program officials as a result of purchases by the Village or as a
prerequisite to maintaining a membership in the program. The Administrator may
also agree that the Village will pay the vendor directly for items or services
received by the Village. The Administrator may also purchase goods and services
upon equivalent or better terms; and, equal or better pricing than a
Cooperative Purchasing Program without legislative action, competitive bidding,
or competitive bargaining.
   (e)   Reverse Auction. Whenever the Administrator determines that the use of
the reverse auction is advantageous to the Village, the Administrator or his
designee may purchase goods or services by reverse auction.
      (1)    The Village, in establishing a reverse auction process, will:
         A.   Determine the specifications and requirements of the goods or
services to be acquired;
         B.   Identify and provide notice to potential sellers concerning the
proposed acquisition;
         C.   Establish prequalification requirements to be met by a seller to
be eligible to participate in the reverse auction.

establish a threshold amount which shall be the maximum amount that the Village
is willing to pay for the goods or services to be acquired.
      (3)    The Village shall enter into a contract with a seller which meets
the specifications or description of the goods or services to be procured and
whose proposal the Village determines to be the Best Value.
   (f)    Intergovernmental Purchases.  Proposed purchases from or with another
political subdivision, the Ohio State Government, or the United States
Government are not subject to competitive bidding requirements and shall not
require further legislative authorization where there are adequate unencumbered
appropriations for that purpose.
   (g)    Design-Build. Proposed purchases of a Design-Build Construction
project let under the procedures established by Council are not subject to
competitive bidding requirements and shall not require further legislative
authorization where there are adequate unencumbered appropriations for that
purpose.
   (h)    Construction-Administrator-At-Risk. Proposed purchases of a
Construction-Administrator-At-Risk project let under the procedures established
by Council are not subject to competitive bidding requirements and shall not
require further legislative authorization where there are adequate unencumbered
appropriations for that purpose.
   (i)    Purchases that do not exceed the bidding threshold set by Council are
not subject to competitive bidding requirements and shall not require further
legislative authorization where there are adequate unencumbered appropriations
for that purpose.
   (j)   Real Estate. The Council may, by ordinance, provide for the purchase,
sale or lease of real property, with or without public bidding, on such terms
and for such value as Council, in the exercise of its discretion, may deem
reasonable and in the best interest of the Village.
      (Ord. 08-13. Passed 1-28-13.)
157.05  EXECUTION AND MODIFICATION OF CONTRACTS.
   Execution and modifications of competitively bid contracts shall not require
competitive bidding; however, such modifications shall be made in good faith
and not made to avoid either the prevailing wage requirements or to avoid the
competitive bidding threshold set by Council.
   (a)   No contract shall be enforceable against the Village unless it has
been duly authorized, as provided for herein, and executed in the name of the
Village by the Village Mayor or Administrator or designee, and bears the
signature of the Fiscal Officer of the Village, as required by Section 5705.41
of the Ohio Revised Code, certifying the availability and appropriation of
funds.
   (b)    Approval Procedure. An alteration or modification to a competitively
bid contract shall be approved only upon the order of the Administrator or
designee. No order shall be effective until the sum to be paid under the
altered or modified contract is agreed to in writing and signed by the
contractor, the Administrator or designee, and the Finance Director or designee
certifying the availability and appropriation of funds.
      (Ord. 08-13. Passed 1-28-13.)
157.06  AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATOR.
        To implement Council policy and procedures as established within this
chapter, the Administrator or designee shall have the authority to promulgate

subsection (A) hereof, shall be sold, disposed, or traded in by the
Administrator by one or more of the following methods:
      (1)   Surplus property with an estimated value of twenty thousand dollars

         C.   By internet auction.
      (2)   Surplus property having an estimated value less than twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000) shall be sold, traded in or disposed of by the

         (Ord. 08-13. Passed 1-28-13.)
157.09 MISCELLANEOUS BIDDING PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures shall apply to contracts that require competitive
bidding.
   (a)    Procedures Related to Bidding.
      (1)   Time between Notice and Bid Opening. There shall be no minimum time
requirement between the publishing of the notice and the opening of the bids.
The Village shall notify prospective bidders of the bid opening date and time
in the Notice and shall adjust the same to meet the needs of the Village by
issuing Addenda when necessary.
      (2)   Addenda Do Not Extend Bid Opening. The Village may issue such
addenda to the bid documents as it feels necessary and such addenda may be
issued up to and including the last business day before the bid opening without
any extension of the bid opening date. Addenda issued the same day as the bid
opening shall cause the bid opening date to be extended to the date and time
set forth in such addenda.
      (3)   Estimate of Cost.  The Village shall disclose the estimated cost of
the project or purchase when it determines that doing so is in its best
interest.
      (4)   Time for Award of Contracts. In the Notice required for the bid
solicitation, the Village shall establish the time limit for awarding a
contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during this period. The Village's
failure to award and execute the contract within this period invalidates the
entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless the time for awarding and
executing the contract is extended by mutual consent of the Village and the
bidder whose bid the Village accepts and with respect to whom the Village
subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such an agreed extension shall not
entitle the contractor to delay costs.
      (5)   Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant to Section
9.31 of the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the Village's
right to award to the next lowest and best bidder.
      (6)   Bids in Excess of Estimate. The Village may award contracts
regardless of the value of the bid as compared to the estimated cost.
      (7)   Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a Notice to
Proceed with the work by the Village upon execution of the contract and no
contractor shall begin work in the absence of a Notice to Proceed. The Village
shall either issue the Notice to Proceed at a time that it determines is in its
best interest or it shall terminate the contract for its convenience.
      (8)   Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the
contractor at the rate set forth in the Village/Contractor agreement. Retainage
shall not be held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such
times and in such amounts as the Village determines to be equitable.
      (9)   General Contractor Permitted. The Village may advertise and award a
single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
      (10)   Extension of Bid Opening. The Village may issue an addendum or
addenda modifying the plans and specifications for the project or the time for
the bid opening at any time prior to the bid opening.
      (11)   Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The Village at its
discretion may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
      (12)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The Village may offer a
bonus for completion of a contract prior to a specified date, or may exact
liquidated damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The
amounts of the bonus and liquidated damages may be different.
      (13)   No Arbitration.  The Village shall not enter into a contract that
requires arbitration as a dispute resolution procedure unless the choice to
arbitrate solely belongs to the Village.
      (14)   Return of Bid Guarantees. The Village shall return bid guaranties
to bidders to which it does not award a contract in a reasonably timely manner.
      (15)   Indemnification. Any clause in any contract with the Village that
requires the Village to indemnify another party shall be void and unenforceable
against the Village.
         (Ord. 08-13. Passed 1-28-13.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.

(a)   If the books and records of a Taxpayer conducting a Business both within
and without the boundaries of the Municipality shall disclose with reasonable
accuracy what portion of its Net Profit is attributable to the conduct of
Business within the boundaries of the Municipality, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs within the Municipality for
purposes of the tax. In the absence of such records, Net Profits from a
Business conducted both within and without the boundaries of the Municipality
shall be considered as having a taxable situs within the Municipality for the
purpose of the tax in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the Taxpayer in the Business in the Municipality
during the taxable period to the average net book value of all of the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the Taxpayer in the Business during
the same period, wherever situated;

property rented or leased by the Taxpayer and the value of such property shall

      (5)   Gross Receipts of the Taxpayer’s Business from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to Gross
Receipts of the Taxpayer’s Business during the same period from sales and
services wherever made or performed.
(b)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
by the Finance Director or his delegate so as to produce an equitable result.
(c)   As used in this Chapter, “sales made in the Municipality” means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property that is delivered within
the Municipality regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from
a stock of goods within the Municipality;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property that is delivered within
the Municipality regardless of where title passes even though transported from
a point outside of the Municipality if the Taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own Employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property that is shipped from a

(e)   An affiliated group of Corporations that files a consolidated Municipal
income tax return pursuant to Section
181.06(g) of this Chapter shall determine the Municipal income tax liability of
each member of the group properly included in the combined filing in accordance
with the following steps:
   Step 1:   Determine the Net Profits of the affiliated group attributable to
each member by applying the allocation factors set forth in Section
181.03 of this Chapter to the consolidated income of the affiliated group. For
this purpose, the numerator of each of the factors shall consist of information
pertaining solely to the individual member as if the numerator of each of the
factors did not contain the phrase “in the Municipality” and the denominator of
each of the factors shall consist of the information pertaining to all members
of the group properly included in the combined return filed with the Village.
The result is the Net Profits of each member of the affiliated group included
in the consolidated Municipal income tax return.
   Step 2:   Determine the Net Profits of each member of the affiliated group
attributable to the Municipality by applying the allocation factors set forth
in Section
181.03 of this Chapter to the Net Profits of each member as determined in
Step1.
   Step 3:   Apply the Municipal income tax rate to the Net Profits of each
member of the affiliated group attributable to the Municipality as determined

or not such net operating loss or any portion thereof is allocable to the
Municipality.
   (b)   Except for an affiliated group of Corporations filing a consolidated
Municipal income tax return pursuant to
181.06(g) of this Chapter, a net operating loss sustained by one Taxpayer may
not be used to offset the Net Profits or Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other
Compensation of any other Taxpayer. (Ord. 28-01. Passed 4-16-01.)
181.05 LEVY OF TAX.
   (a)   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other Compensation earned on and after January
1, 1976, and with respect to the Net Profits of Business earned on and after
January 1, 1976. Provided however, that where the Fiscal Year of the Business
differs from the Calendar Year the tax shall be applied to that part of the Net
Profits for the Fiscal Year as shall be earned, received or accrued on and
after January 1, 1976, to the close of the Taxpayer’s Fiscal Year. Thereafter,
the Taxpayer shall report on its Fiscal Year basis.
   (b)   Where the Fiscal Year of a Business is other than a Calendar Year, in
computing the initial tax the profits of such Taxpayer shall be determined by
dividing the annual profits by twelve and multiplying the quotient by the
number of months within the period commencing January 1, 1976, and ending at
the conclusion of such Fiscal Year.
(Ord. 28-01. Passed 4-16-01.)
181.06 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each Taxpayer who engages in Business or whose Salaries, Wages,

Chapter shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on

Commissions and Other Compensation earned and/or Net Profits earned and/or
Gross Receipts from such Business less allowable expenses in the acquisition of
such Gross Receipts earned during the preceding year and subject to the tax,
together with such other pertinent information as the Finance Director or his
delegate may require. The Municipality shall also accept for filing a Generic
Form of such return and related documents if the Generic Form, once completed
and filed, contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Municipality’s prescribed form and if the Taxpayer or Return Preparer filing
the Generic Form otherwise complies with the rules and ordinances of the
Municipality governing the filing of returns. When the return is made for a
Fiscal Year or other period different from the Calendar Year, the return shall
be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the close of
such Fiscal Year or other period.
   (b)   Each Taxpayer whose Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other

from any Business when conducted in this Municipality or in any municipality
that does not levy an income tax on Net Profits therefrom.
   (c)   Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December 31,
1981, the net loss from an unincorporated business activity may not be used to
offset Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other Compensation. However, if a
Taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity,
except any portion of a loss separately reportable for Municipal tax purposes
to another taxing entity, may be used to offset the profits of another for
purposes of arriving at overall Net Profits. A husband and wife, in any Taxable
Year, may elect to file separate or joint returns.
   (d)   If a net operating loss has been sustained in any Taxable Year, such
loss may not be carried forward or backward to any other Taxable Year.
   (e)   The Taxpayer making a return shall at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the Municipality the amount of taxes shown as due thereon provided,
however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at
the source, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the Taxpayer, or
where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit for the
amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
   (f)   A Taxpayer who has overpaid his income tax in any Taxable Year may
request a refund provided, however, there is no other tax liability and
provided, further, that no amount of less than one dollar ($1.00) will be
refunded or collected.
   (g)   Consolidated income tax returns for an Applicable Taxable Year shall
be accepted from any affiliated group of Corporations each of which is subject
to Municipal income tax if that affiliated group filed a consolidated return
for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code for the Applicable Taxable Year. The Municipal income tax
liability of each member of the affiliated group, however, shall be determined
separately for each member of the affiliated group as provided in Section

paid to the Finance Director on or before the Annual Return Due Date.

federal schedules or other such similar documentation as is required by
instructions to the return to verify earnings and any Municipal income tax

income tax purposes unless that individual has claimed the same deduction for
federal income tax purposes and attaches to her annual return a copy of the
federal Form 2106 filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
   (k)   Each individual earning or receiving income from Business or from
rental property shall file with her tax return a copy of Schedule C, Schedule E
or other similar form that was filed with her federal income tax return for the
Applicable Taxable Year regardless of whether such form shows a profit or loss.
(Ord. 70-14. Passed 12-8-14.)
181.07 AMENDED RETURNS, REFUNDS AND EXTENSION REQUESTS.
   (a)   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional
income and pay any additional tax due or claim a refund of tax overpaid, the
amended return shall be on a form furnished by or obtainable from the Finance
Director or his delegate. The Municipality shall also accept for filing a
generic form of such amended return and related documents if the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required to be
submitted with the Municipality’s prescribed form and if the Taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules and
ordinances of the Municipality governing the filing of amended returns. A
Taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of Net
Profits after the date for filing the original return.
   (b)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the Taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, the Taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon.
   (c)   No refund shall be allowed unless a written request is presented to
the Finance Director or his delegate within the time limitation specified in
Section 718.12(A) of the Revised Code.
   (d)   Should it appear that any Taxpayer has paid more than the amount of
the tax to which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this
Chapter or should it be found that the tax paid or withheld was done so in
error, a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made, provided that a timely
claim for refund has been filed by the Taxpayer. No interest shall be paid by
the Municipality on any overpayment by a Taxpayer except as provided in Section
718.12 of the Revised Code.
   (e)   The Finance Director or his delegate shall extend the time for filing
of the Annual Return of the Taxpayer for a period equivalent to any extension
granted by the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the federal income
tax return for the Applicable Taxable Year provided such request for extension
is filed not later than the Annual Return Due Date for the Applicable Taxable
Year.
   (f)   A copy of the federal extension request must be included with the
Municipal income tax return, and payment of Municipal income tax shown to be
due thereon must nevertheless be paid by the Annual Return Due Date for the
Applicable Taxable Year.
   (g)   The Municipality may deny the Taxpayer’s request for an extension if
the Taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file a copy of the
request for the federal extension, owes the Municipality any delinquent income
tax or any penalty, interest, assessment, or other charge for the late payment
or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any required income tax
return, report, or other related document for a prior tax period.
(Ord. 70-14. Passed 12-8-14.)

taxes have in fact been withheld.
   Every Employer, officer of a Corporation, or partner or member of an
Association or Other Entity, is deemed to be a trustee for this Municipality in
collecting and holding the Municipal income tax required under this Section to
be deducted and withheld, and the funds so collected by such withholding are
deemed to be trust funds.
   (b)   Employers shall pay to the Municipality all Municipal income taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on either a semi-
monthly, monthly or quarterly basis depending on the amount of taxes deducted
and withheld according to the following payment schedule:
      (1)   Semi-monthly payments of taxes withheld or deducted shall be made
by an Employer if the total taxes withheld or deducted in the prior Calendar
Year were twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) or more or the amount of taxes
withheld or deducted during any month in the preceding quarter exceeded one
thousand dollars ($1,000). Such payments shall be paid to the Municipality
within five (5) banking days after the fifteenth and the last day of each
calendar month.
      (2)   Monthly payments of taxes withheld or deducted shall be made by an
Employer if the total taxes withheld or deducted in the prior Calendar Year
were less than twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) but more than one thousand one
hundred and ninety-nine dollars ($1,199) or if the taxes withheld or deducted
during any month in the preceding quarter exceeded one hundred dollars
($100.00). Such payments shall be paid to the Municipality within five (5)
banking days after the last day of each calendar month. However, those taxes
accumulated for the third month of the calendar quarter need not be paid until
the last day of the calendar month following the end of each calendar quarter.
      (3)   All Employers not required to make semi-monthly or monthly payments
of taxes withheld under subsections (1) and (2) above shall make quarterly
payments no later than the last day of the calendar month following the end of
each calendar quarter.
   (c)   Each Employer who maintains a place of Business in the Municipality
and another branch within the metropolitan area of the Municipality, shall also
deduct or withhold the tax from the Employees residing in the Municipality but
working at the Employer’s metropolitan area branch, even though the payroll
records and place of payment are outside the Municipality.
   (d)   The Employer shall make and file a return on a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Finance Director or his delegate, showing the amount of tax
deducted by the Employer from the Salaries, Wages, Commissions or Other
Compensation of any Employee and paid by the Employer to the Municipality. The
Municipality shall also accept for filing a generic form of such Employer
return and related documents if the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Municipality’s prescribed form and if the Taxpayer or return preparer filing
the generic form otherwise complies with the rules and ordinances of the
Municipality governing Employer returns. Such Employer’s return shall be
accepted as the return required of an Employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Chapter is the Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other
Compensation returned by the Employer.
   (e)   Each Employer, on or before the thirty-first day of January of each
Calendar year, unless a written request for a thirty-day extension is made to
and granted by the Finance Director or his delegate, following any Calendar
Year in which such withholdings or deductions as required by this section have
been made or should have been made by such Employer, shall make and file with
the Finance Director or his delegate an information return on a form furnished
by or obtainable from the Finance Director or his delegate, specifically, the
Obetz Withholding Statement of Wages Paid and Obetz Income Tax Withheld, for
each Employee from whom income tax has been or should have been deducted or
withheld, show the name and address of the Employee, the total amount of
Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other Compensation paid such Employee during
the year and the amount of Municipal income tax deducted or withheld from each
Employee. The Municipality shall also accept for filing a generic form of such
information return and related documents if the generic form, once completed
and filed, contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Municipality’s prescribed form and if the Taxpayer or return preparer filing
the generic form otherwise complies with the rules and ordinances of the
Municipality governing the filing of information returns. In addition, each
Employer, on or before January 31 of each Calendar year, shall provide each
Employee a Form W-2 showing the name, address and social security number of the
Employee, the total amount of Salaries, Wages, Commissions and Other
Compensation paid to the Employee during the prior Calendar Year and the amount
of Municipal income tax deducted or withheld from such Employee. An alternative
method of reporting in lieu of submitting Form W-2 must be approved by the
Finance Director or his delegate. The Finance Director may provide by uniform
rule or regulation for the use of electronic media by Employers for reporting
annual wage and tax data.
   (f)   Where a Resident of the Municipality performs a service for his
Employer in another municipality, which services are subject to withholding in
the other municipality, the Employer shall have the authority to reduce the
withholding to the Municipality to the extent of the tax liability in the other
municipality.
   (g)   The officer or the Employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment shall
be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due as
required by this section as well as any related interest and penalties. The
dissolution or liquidation of a Corporation, Association or Other Entity does
not discharge an officer’s or Employee’s liability for a prior failure of the
Corporation, Association or Other Entity to file returns or pay tax due as
required by this section.
   (h)   Failure to file any required documentation in a timely manner is
subject to assessment of a late filing penalty.
   (i)   As used in this Section, “Other Payer” means any Person that pays an
individual any item included in the taxable income of the individual, other
than the individual’s Employer or that Employer’s agent.
      (1)   Any Nonresident Employer, agent of such an Employer, or Other Payer
that is not situated in the Municipality is not required to deduct and withhold
taxes from the taxable income of an individual unless the total amount of tax
required to be deducted and withheld for the Municipality on account of all of
the Employer’s Employees or all of the Other Payer’s payees exceeds one hundred
fifty dollars for a Calendar Year.
If the total amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld on account of
all of the Nonresident Employer’s Employees or all of the Other Payer’s payees
exceeds one hundred fifty dollars for a Calendar Year, the Municipality may
require the Employer, agent, or Other Payer to deduct and withhold taxes in
each ensuing year even if the amount required to be deducted and withheld in
each of those ensuing years is one hundred fifty dollars or less, except as
otherwise provided in Subsection (2) of this Section.
      (2)   If a Nonresident Employer, agent of such an Employer, or Other
Payer that is not situated in the Municipality is required to deduct and
withhold taxes for an ensuing year under Subsection (1) of this Section, and
the total amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld under that
Division in each of three consecutive ensuing years is one hundred fifty
dollars or less, the Municipality shall not require the Employer, agent, or
Other Payer to deduct and withhold taxes in any year following the last of
those consecutive years unless the amount required to be deducted and withheld
in any such following year exceeds one hundred fifty dollars.

States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property

income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

182.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
          (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.   
         (c)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the receding calendar
year exceeded one thousand dollars. The payment under division (B)(1)(c) of

            (i)    If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            (ii)    If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer may be required
to make payment by electronic funds transfer, in the discretion of the Tax
Administrator, of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for
remittance to the Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer is required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying
federal taxes withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the
Internal Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or
regulation. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division
does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any
return as required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
 182.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

      (6)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in section
182.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
182.051 of this Chapter.

return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such

      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)

182.061  DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
 182.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

182.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the

   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
 182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
182.051, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of
personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
182.051.
         (Ord. 51-23. Passed 12-11-23.)
182.063  CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
 182.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

182.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
    The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit. (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-

purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax

         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the    taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
182.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
 182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
 182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)

taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax,
regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
            (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all
nonresident and resident individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer,

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person

   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal

of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
 182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.

filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
 182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.092  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.093  USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
municipal income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be
the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under this section, the tax administrator shall not make any
inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or
before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due
date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
   If a tax administrator violates this division (F), the municipal corporation
shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to
such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.
(Ord. 51-23. Passed 12-11-23.)
182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
182.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
section
182.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the

less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)

   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
 182.10 of this Chapter.

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 72-15. Passed
12-14-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession

accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person

the request was directed pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section

identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of

official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,

Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty

Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review may be appointed to or
serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 72-15. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.60 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
182.61(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703
of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the Village on a form prescribed by the

      (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the Village of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.61 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
182.062 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
182.03(23)(D) of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal
taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section
182.063(E)(3)(B) of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with Section
182.063(E)(3)(B) of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in Section
182.03(47)(B) of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded
partnership that has made the election described in Section
182.03(23(D) of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.62 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under section
182.60 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.051 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
182.70 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
182.70 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions(11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of section
182.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Village or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.63 INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances is confidential, and no person shall disclose
such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper
judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised
Code. The tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies
of returns filed. This section does not prohibit the publication of statistics
in a form which does not disclose information with respect to particular
taxpayers.
   (B)    In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
the Village tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer
that filed tax returns with the commissioner under sections

pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.64 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

information.
         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may

commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that

including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.

182.66 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
182.60 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
182.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
182.60 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
182.61 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
182.61 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
182.62 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
182.62 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
182.62 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
182.62 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.67 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
182.60 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
182.70 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.68 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.69 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
182.60 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
182.71 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
182.70 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.70 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
182.71 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section 182.91 of the Codified Ordinances, with
interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.71 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
182.70 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-
26-18.)
182.72 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
182.60 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
182.70 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
182.71 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
182.71 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 08-18. Passed 2-26-18.)
182.73 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
182.60 to
182.75 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

182.064 or
182.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any

187.02  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village for the use of the General Fund of the Village, an excise tax is
hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel, motel, transient
accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   The tax is three percent of the amount paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is collectible at the time
the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax
does not apply to lodging furnished to the State, or any of its political
subdivisions, or any charitable organization for the lodging of transient
indigent individuals, when such charitable organization pays the hotel or
transient accommodation for such lodging.
   (c)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this Chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the taxes it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels, motels, or transient accommodations in the Village to transient guest
is subject to the taxes until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.021 IMPOSITION OF TAX PURSUANT TO OHIO R.C. 5739.024(B).
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village for the use of the General Fund of the Village and for the purpose
of providing funds to convention and visitors bureaus operating in the county
in which the Village is located for the promotion and publicizing of the
Village as a desirable location for conventions, trade shows and similar events
to encourage the patronage and business of cultural, educational, religious,
professional, sports and other activities to utilize the Village, an excise tax
is hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel, motel or
transient accommodations is or is to be furnished to transient guests. The
excise tax levied under this section is in addition to any tax imposed by the
Village on the same transaction as enacted pursuant to Ordinance 44-95 (Passed
November 6, 1995) and codified under this Chapter at Section
187.02. The tax levied under this section is three percent (3%) of the amount
paid or to be paid by the transient guests for the lodging. The tax applies and
is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when
the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the State or
any of its political subdivisions, or any charitable organization for the
lodging of transient indigent individuals, when such charitable organization
pays the hotel, motel, or transient accommodation for such lodging.
   (b)    Fifty percent (50%) of the revenue from the tax levied pursuant to
this section, shall be deposited into a separate fund, which shall be spent
solely to make contributions to convention and visitors' bureaus operating in
the county in which the Village is located, and the balance of such revenue
shall be deposited into the General Fund of the Village.
   (c)    Each convention and visitors' bureau which receives funds pursuant to
this section shall, within 120 days after the end of their fiscal year, provide
to the Treasurer of the Village financial statements of the organization for
such fiscal year, prepared accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, consistently applied, with an opinion thereof by a firm of
certified public accountants.
   (d)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of
Chapter 187 shall apply to the tax imposed under this section.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   (a)   The taxes imposed by this Chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
taxes. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the taxes apply.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.04 REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this Chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the taxes, the
vendor's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sales
was exempted by reason of such identity or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for another reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Finance Director and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Finance Director, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer. (Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.05 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall, on or before the twentieth day of each month, make
and file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Finance
Director, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of taxes due
from the vendor to the Village for the period covered by the return and such
other information as the Finance Director deems necessary for the proper
administration of this Chapter. The Finance Director may extend the time for
making and filing returns with just cause. Returns shall be filed by mailing or
delivering the same to the Finance Director, together with payment of the
amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   (b)   The Finance Director may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such to merit monthly returns as determined by the Finance Director upon the
basis of administrative costs to the Village, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (c)   The Finance Director shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the
date received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a return under this
Chapter, shall forfeit and pay into the Village Treasury a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the taxes owed.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.06 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Finance Director shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the Finance Director, he shall refund
to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the Finance Director,
on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it is
ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous. However,
in any event such application for refund must be filed with the Finance
Director within four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of
the tax. On filing such application, the Finance Director shall determine the
amount of refund due. The Finance Director shall make such payment from the
General Fund.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.07  LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any vendor collects taxes imposed by or pursuant to this Chapter
and fails to remit the same to the Village as prescribed, he shall be
personally liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The
Finance Director may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any
information in the Finance Director possession.
   (b)   If any vendor fails to collect the taxes or any transient guest fails
to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to this Chapter on any transaction
subject to the taxes, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable
for the amount of the taxes applicable to the transaction. The Finance Director
may make an assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the
facts may require, based upon any information in his possession.
   (c)   An assessment against a vendor in cases, where the taxes imposed by or
pursuant to this Chapter have not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's lodging to reimburse the vendor for the taxes applicable
to such transaction.
   (d)   In each case the Finance Director shall give to the vendor or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered
or certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the
provisions of this Chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor
a bar to an assessment against the other for the taxes applicable to the same
transaction, provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or
transient guest for the taxes due on a particular transaction if such taxes
have actually been paid by another.
   (e)   The Finance Director may make an assessment against any vendor who
fails to file a return required by this Chapter or fails to remit the proper
amount of taxes in accordance with this Chapter. When information in the
possession of the Finance Director indicates that the amount required to be
collected is, or should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Finance Director may, upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business for
a representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which
the taxes required to be collected under this Chapter bears to the hotel's or
transient accommodation's lodgings which determination shall be the basis of an
assessment as herein provided in this Chapter. Notice of such assessment shall
be made in the manner prescribed in this Chapter.
   (f)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom such notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, a petition in writing, verified
under oath by such vendor, transient guest, or this authorized agent, having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of such
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, such
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable from the vendor or transient guests so assessed to the Finance
Director. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Finance Director shall
assign a time and place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petitioner
thereof by registered or certified mail, but the Finance Director may continue
the hearings from time to time if necessary.
   (g)   A penalty of fifteen percent (15%) shall be added to the amount of
every assessment made under this Chapter. The Finance Director may adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added
to assessments made under this Chapter.
   (h)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this Chapter, the assessment made by the Finance Director,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days
after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.08 FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any taxes imposed by or pursuant to this Chapter more that four (4) years
after the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or
more than four (4) years after the return for such period is filed, whichever
is later. This section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)    When the Finance Director has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from the transient guest's lodging which were not
returned to the Village;
   (b)    When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.09  TAXES PAID TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT.
    No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact taxes as required
by this Chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax. (Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.10 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAXES; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact taxes as required by this
Chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the taxes levied pursuant to this Chapter, or
make in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which
might imply that he is absorbing the taxes, or paying the taxes for the
transient guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price
including the taxes, or rebating the taxes in any other manner. (Ord. 57-98.
Passed 6-15-98.)
187.11  REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)    No person, including any officer or employee of a corporation having
control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns,
shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed by this Chapter,
or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or fraudulent return, or
statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of any false or fraudulent
return, report or statement.
   (b)    If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this Chapter
fails, on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the taxes thereon; or if
any vendor authorized by the Finance Director to file returns at less frequent
intervals fails, on two or more occasions within a twenty-four (24) month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the taxes due thereon, the
Finance Director may require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal
to the average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one (1) year, as
determined by the Finance Director from a review of returns or other
information pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00). The security may be in the form of an
advance tax payment to be applied to pay the taxes due on subsequent returns,
or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Finance Director, conditioned
upon payment of the taxes due with the returns from the vendor. The security
must be filed within ten days following the vendor's receipt of the notice from
the Finance Director of its requirements.
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to
the vendor, if, for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months following the
date of bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this Chapter.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)
187.12 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit taxes due to
the Village under the provisions of this Chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit taxes due. The sum
due for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this Chapter.
(Ord. 57-98. Passed 6-15-98.)

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

municipal corporation.

certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the

use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to

schools and presents evidence of this filing to the jurisdiction from which it
is requesting the establishment of a school zone;

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

control signals;
      (10)   Seventy miles per hour on all rural freeways;
      (11)   Fifty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or

located within a municipal corporation or within an interstate freeway
outerbelt, except as provided in subsection (b)(12) of this section;
      (12)   Sixty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or
expressways without traffic control signals in urbanized areas.
   (c)   It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or any declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and
it is unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed limitations in

provision of this section may be charged in the alternative in a single
affidavit.
   (d)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a street or highway as

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs. It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the
speed limits posted upon such signs.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permit, or identification card unless and until the person
surrenders to the Registrar or a deputy registrar all valid licenses, temporary
instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

identification card is now issued in this state. The Registrar or a deputy
registrar shall destroy any such license, temporary instruction permit, or
identification card that is not returned to the issuing authority.
      (3)   No person shall possess more than one valid license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card at any time.
         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two
or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

offense.

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other

339.02 USE OF LOCAL STREETS; LOCAL PERMIT AND CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Use of Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a
height, width, length, or weight as specified in Section
339.03, or Sections 5577.01 through 5577.09 of the Ohio Revised Code upon any
Village-maintained street without a Special Hauling Permit granted by the
Village.
   (b)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Village Administrator may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move
an oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local
streets. This permit may be referenced as a "Special Hauling Permit."
      (1)    Special Hauling Permits cover only Village-maintained streets or
highways. No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction; however, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon State routes as provided in Section
339.01. The Village assumes no responsibility for the failure of the applicant
to secure permits required by the State or any other governing authority.
      (2)    The Village Administrator may grant a permit for a single or round
trip, or for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Village
Administrator in his discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any
construction project. The Village Administrator may limit or prescribe terms or
conditions of operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by
designating the route, hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, property, health and
safety. The Village Administrator may require the posting of bond or other
security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)    The Village Administrator shall be responsible for administering
the issuance of Special Hauling Permits. All applications for a Special Hauling
Permit are subject to the following terms and conditions:
         A.   The granting of a Special Hauling Permit shall not be construed
as a guarantee or representation by the Village that the load described can be
moved without damage to the pavement or structures in or adjacent to the right-
of-way.
         B.   The permittee will be liable for any damage caused by the
movement. The Village assumes no responsibility or liability for damage to the
permittee's equipment or the load being moved. The permittee agrees to
compensate the Village for any damage to a Village-maintained roadway or road
structure and to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the Village, its
employees, agents, and officials against all liabilities, losses, obligations,
claims, damages, penalties, suits, actions, judgments, costs and expenses of
any nature incurred or brought against the Village, its employees, agents, and
officials as a result of injury or death of persons or damages to or loss of
property caused by acts or omissions by permittee, its agents, servants, and
employees in the performance of movements under the Special Hauling Permit.
         C.   If the insurance policy or policies filed in conjunction with the
Special Hauling Permit application lapses and is not timely renewed, resulting
in a lapse of coverage, the Special Hauling Permit shall no longer be valid.
         D.   The Special Hauling Permit shall be in the driver's possession at
all times during the movement and shall be shown on demand to any police
officer, state highway patrol trooper, sheriff, deputy sheriff, Ohio Department
of Transportation employee, or employee of the Village.
         E.   Movements under the Special Hauling Permit are limited to the
route specified between the designated points within the time allotted.
         F.   Movements under the Special Hauling permit shall be made not to
impede normal highway traffic beyond the least extent possible. All movements
shall be made at such speeds and in such a manner as to cause a minimum of
interference with other traffic and minimum impact stress on structures and
pavements.
         G.   No vehicle or object moving under the Special Hauling Permit
shall be parked in the roadway, either day or night, except in case of
emergency. In the case of emergency, the permittee shall deploy flares, signs,
and other measures to protect the traveling public.
         H.   No vehicle or object moved under the Special Hauling Permit shall
be loaded or unloaded in the right-of-way.
         I.   Permittees must comply with all laws, rules, and regulations
covering movement of traffic over highways and streets, and operation of
vehicles.
         J.   Reductions in legal weights posted on roadways and bridges, if
any, must be obeyed unless specifically stated otherwise in the Special Hauling
Permit.
         K.   No vehicles or objects being transported under a Special Hauling
Permit shall travel in convoy with any other oversized and/or overweight
vehicle, or vehicle load. Every vehicle operating under a Special Hauling
Permit shall maintain a minimum spacing of 500 feet from all vehicles traveling
in front and in the same lane as said vehicle, whenever possible.
         L.   Every vehicle operating under a Special Hauling Permit shall,
when traveling on freeways, expressways or multi-lane undivided highways,
remain in the extreme right-hand lane of said highway except as necessary to
maintain continuous through movement, to make left turns or exits on its
approved route, or to pass other vehicles. Over-width vehicles shall not pass
other vehicles traveling in the same direction. Nothing in these limitations on
the use of Special Hauling Permits shall permit what state law forbids.
         M.   Permits will not generally be issued for built-up loads that are
divisible into legal loads, or into loads of the least over dimension or the
least overweight. If, in the event of an extenuating circumstance, a permit is
issued for a divisible load, such loud must be adequately described. Milk
transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed to a nondivisible load to the extent
so deemed by State law or rule.
         N.   Loads of extremely large dimensions shall require additional
protective measures when necessary for the safeguarding of other traffic. Due
regard shall be taken of traffic in both directions and every possible effort
shall be made to prevent traffic congestion. One or more flagmen, or a pilot
car, may be required.
         O.   A permit is void at any time road, weather, or traffic conditions
make travel unsafe.
      (4)   Signs shall be posted indicating "no thru trucks" or words of
similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this Chapter.
No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
      (5)    Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Village Administrator shall be cause for immediate
revocation or suspension of such permit, and denial of request for any future
permit. Such violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty
prescribed by Section
 303.99.
   (c)   The Village Administrator shall be responsible for calculating and
collecting the permit fee. The permit fee shall be in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Village for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the
permit, including but not limited to the per-hour cost of police traffic
supervision, and to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or vehicles. The fee to cover the cost of normal and
expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway structure may be
calculated on a per-mile basis. The fee shall be noted on the Special Hauling
Permit Application. The Village Administrator shall recalculate the fee amounts
from time to time to ensure that they remain sufficient to reimburse the
Village's costs. (Ord. 09-18. Passed 2-26-18.)

Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   (a)   Program Introduction. In order to control the spread of pests, the
Village of Obetz has established a pest management control program. The program
is designed to assist households negatively affected by pests. The program is
designed to limit the spread of pests within the Village in an effort to
prevent the spread of disease and maintain property values.
 
   (b)   Program Guidelines.
      (1)   Pests, Defined.  For purposes of this program, pests shall be
defined as roaches, bed bugs, mice, rats and any other pests or insects that
are causing an infestation as determined by the Village Administrator.
      (2)   Eligible Projects. Property owners whose property has been overrun
with pests as determined by the Village Administrator may apply for assistance
to have their property treated for pests. Properties overrun with pests as a
result of an infestation from a surrounding property are also eligible for
treatment assistance provided the infestation has been remedied.
      (3)   Application Required. An application for assistance through the
Pest Management Control Program shall be filed with the Village Administrator
by the property owner.
        (4)   Inspection Required. Prior to receiving a grant from the Village,
the property owner will allow the Code Enforcement Officer to inspect the
inside and outside of the property. If the property has any existing code
violations, those violations must be remedied prior to treating the property
for the pests.
      (5)   Ineligible Applicants.  Assistance will not be issued to any
applicant who is in arrears in connection with any municipal, county, or state
financial obligation.
      (6)   Need Based Program. This program is need based. The Village
Administrator shall establish income guidelines for participants. Only property
owners who could not otherwise afford treatment will be offered assistance.
      (7)   Coordination of Pest Treatment. The Village or its representative
will treat the property for the pest(s). The Village or its representative will
select the most appropriate treatment and coordinate the treatment with the
property owner.
   (c)   Award of Assistance.  The Village will review the application for
completeness. Once a project is selected, the applicant will be notified. There
is no guarantee that funds will be available each year. Submittal of an
application does not guarantee assistance. The Village Administrator has the
sole discretion to deny a request for assistance.

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the

   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

 545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18  do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

wastewater into a public sewer of the Municipality shall be required to
construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his wastewater, including
sanitary wastewater.
      (2)    Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built
in a manner acceptable to the Administrator. If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed they shall be of a type acceptable to the Administrator.
      (3)    Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall
be installed by the person discharging the wastewater at his expense, and shall
be maintained by him so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper
operating condition at all times. Plans for the installation of such facilities
shall be approved by the Administrator prior to the beginning of construction.
      (4)    In the event no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole may be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building or house sewer is connected.
   (b)    Wastewater Volume Determination. The volume of flow used for
computing industrial wastewater charges shall be the metered water consumption
of the industrial user as shown in the records of water meter readings
maintained by the Municipality, except as herein provided in the following
paragraphs.
      (1)    If the person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
Municipal water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public
sewers, the person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a
type approved by the Administrator for the purpose of determining the volume of
water obtained from those other sources.
      (2)    The person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining
the volume of wastewater being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial wastewater charges would be computed. The measuring devices shall be
of a type acceptable to the Administrator.
      (3)    The Administrator may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of wastewater discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (4)    Any metering device for determining the volume of wastewater
discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned and maintained by the
industrial user. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be
removed without the consent of the Administrator.
   (c)    Sampling and Monitoring. 
      (1)    Industrial wastewaters discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Administrator, but in no case less than one twenty-
four hour composite sample per quarter of a year. The owner shall be
responsible for the collection and testing of the aforementioned samples;
however, the Municipality or an authorized representative of the Municipality
may assume the responsibility for the collection and testing of such samples at
any time so designated by the Administrator.
      (2)    Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastewater. The sampling shall be
accomplished by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples, or by other approved means.
      (3)    Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Administrator
or his authorized representative at all times. Care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
   (d)    Analyses. 
      (1)    Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastewaters shall be those set forth in the latest edition of "Standard
Methods" or "EPA Methods". However, alternative methods for certain analyses of
industrial wastewaters may be used subject to mutual agreement between the
Administrator and the industrial user. Reference is made to EPA "Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants" (40 CFR 136).
      (2)    Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastewaters shall be made by the industrial user responsible for the discharge,
or the industrial user's qualified agent as approved by the Administrator. The
results of the analyses shall be reported to the Municipality on a quarterly
basis on forms provided by the Municipality. The Municipality may make its own
analyses on the wastewaters and these determinations, when made, shall be
binding as a basis for charges, except under circumstances in subsection (d)(3)
hereof.
      (3)    In case the analyses performed by the industry and the
Municipality result in substantially different values, an effort shall be made
by the industry
   to collect samples at the same time the Municipality collects its own
samples. The results of the analyses on the samples collected by the
Municipality and the industry shall be compared using the same testing
procedures as outlined in the latest edition of “Standard Methods” and the
differences negotiated. (Ord. 43-80. Passed 9-8-80.)
935.12 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (a)   The Administrator, and other duly authorized employees of the

   (c)   Front Footage Fee/Main Line Charge. Upon application being made to
connect to any main trunk or lateral sewer built or owned by the Village of
Obetz and of any property directly into such main trunk or lateral sewer the
Administrator shall cause a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) per foot of width of
said property to be exacted for the privilege of making such a direct
connection to such main sewer or lateral sewer before a permit is issued
therefore, provided that this charge shall not be imposed if the owner of the
property concerned can show that he or his predecessor in titled paid, or is
paying a special assessment for the construction of the main trunk or lateral
sought to be tapped or at his own expense constructed all or part of such main
or lateral sewer sought to be tapped. The number of front footage fee to be
paid shall be determined by one of the following applicable methods.
      (1)   Lots or parcels of ground having the same width at the front and
rear and the same depth on each side shall be charged on the basis of the
actual frontage; provided, however, that in the event the depth of such lot or
parcel of ground abuts on the street or other public way and the owner elects
to construct a building fronting on the street or public way abutting such
depth, the fee shall be exacted for such depth.
      (2)   Lots or parcels of ground which are of irregular shape shall be
charged on the basis of the width of such property as measured on a line forty
feet from the front lot line and parallel to the center line of the street upon
which such property is to face, except that for lots or parcels of ground
having curved frontage the width to be charged for shall be measured on a line
parallel to the forty feet distant from a line tangent to such curved frontage
at a point midway between the sides of the lots or parcels of ground.
      (3)   The number of feet to be paid for shall be determined by the use of
an engineer’s scale applied to the record drawings of the sewer sought to be
tapped, on file in the office of the Village Engineer, and the widths so
determined by the Clerk issuing the permit shall be final. The amounts as
collected shall be placed to the credit of the sewer fund.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Owners affected by the “Kleinline Lane Waterline and Sanitary
Sewer Project” may choose to pay the connection charges provided in subsection
(c) hereof as set forth in Ordinance 70-03, passed November 17, 2003.

site sanitary sewer, the Developer shall submit a certified cost of the
construction and a map showing the tributary area, with acreage, of the
property that is to be served by the sewer. The Village shall determine a fee
per acre for all of the property to be served by dividing the certified
construction costs of the sewer by the number of acres. The certified cost
shall be reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer. The Village will charge
future property owners in the tributary area, when they connect into this
sewer, the fee so calculated times the number of acres to be served. This
amount shall be reimbursed directly to the Developer. This agreement shall
continue for a period of ten years after which the Developer will have no claim
for reimbursement.

   (e)   Water Main Extension Charges.
      (1)   The Administrator is authorized to provide water service to new
consumers when he determines that the water main extension is feasible both
economically and from an engineering point of view and will not be detrimental
to the best interest of the Municipality having given consideration to the
overall effect on the total water system and to the long term plans and
probable future growth of the water system of the Municipality. All such action
is subject to Council approval.
         (Ord. 7-76. Passed 4-5-76.)
      (2)   The applicant(s) and/or developer(s) requesting a water main
extension, shall be solely responsible for all cost associated with the
requested water main extension in the Municipality. Where a water main
extension is required by the Municipality to be installed larger than eight
inches in nominal diameter, the Municipality shall pay one hundred ten percent
of the difference in material cost of an 8-inch water main and the water main
installed.
         A.   When an off-site water line is constructed, with approval of the
Village, by a Developer, the Developer shall submit the following to the
Village: a map showing the property abutting the water line and a certified
cost of the construction of the off-site water line. The certified cost shall
be reviewed and approved by the Village Engineer. A per front foot cost shall
be determined by dividing the construction cost by the frontage of all abutting
property. Abutting properties tapping into the water line will be charged the
front foot cost as established by code. The Village will then reimburse the
developer his front foot cost as previously established, but in no case more
than the amount collected by the Village. This agreement shall continue for a
period of 10 years after which the Developer will have no claim for
reimbursement.
            (Ord. 82-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
      (3)   The Superintendent of Water shall determine from the records or
other sources, the cost of the pipe, fittings and valves and this determination
shall be final.
      (4)   The Administrator may authorize water main extensions to be
installed by a qualified developer and he shall determine whether the water
main shall be installed by the Municipality or by the applicants or developer,
subject to Council approval.
      (5)   When water main extensions are installed by the Municipality, the
cost may be assessed against the abutting property owners, with the approval of
Council. Such assessment shall be in an amount equal to the total installation
cost unless the line is required by the Municipality to be larger than eight
inches. When the water main is required by the Municipality to be installed
larger than eight inches, the amount assessed shall be the total installation
cost less one hundred ten percent of the difference in the cost of the pipes,
fittings and valves between the installation of an eight-inch water main and
the water main installed. The costs shall be determined as prescribed herein.
      (6)   The specifications and standards of construction for all water main
extensions shall be prepared by the Administrator. Plans and installation shall
be subject to approval of the professional engineer representative of the
Administrator and subject to Council approval.
      (7)   The size of all water mains shall be determined by the
Superintendent of Water and shall be large enough not only to serve the areas
under immediate consideration but also to serve areas which are likely to be
developed and which should be served by the water main under consideration and
in accordance to recommendations of the Ohio Fire Inspection Bureau. Unless
otherwise required by the Superintendent of Water, no water main shall be
smaller than six inches nominal diameter.
      (8)   All extensions of water mains shall include the installation of all
taps, valves and fire hydrants. The number and location of fire hydrants shall
be in accordance with the requirements of the Administrator and the Ohio
Inspection Bureau guidelines and comply with Hamilton Township Fire Department
requirements for hydrant specifications. The number and location of all taps
and valves shall be as required by the Superintendent of Water.
      (9)   All water mains and appurtenances shall be owned, operated and
maintained by the Municipality, with title to be vested in the Municipality
upon completion of the water main. All public water lines shall lie on public
easements or right of ways.
         (Ord. 7-76. Passed 4-5-76.)
      (10)   No water mains shall be installed by private developers or
concerns unless authorized by an agreement between the Municipality and the
developer or applicants. Where water mains are installed by a developer or
applicants which abut on parcels not owned by the developer or applicants, nor
which have been included in the agreement, the developer or applicants shall be
entitled to reimbursement when such parcels are connected to the water main.
Such connections shall be made within ten years from the completion of the
water main construction to be considered for such reimbursement. This
reimbursement, minus an administrative fee, will be paid to the developer from
the funds collected by the Municipality for such connections. The amount of the
reimbursement shall be determined by dividing the cost of the water main paid
by the developer or applicants by the available frontage abutting the public
right of way where the improvements have been made. To be eligible for this
reimbursement, the developer or applicants must file with the Superintendent of
Water the standards and specifications, receipts for all labor and material
used in connection with the construction of the water main, together with
final, as- built plans, properly referenced for future location of the work.
This information must be received by the Superintendent within ninety days of
completion of the water main or at such further time that may be authorized by
the Administrator.
      (11)   When a master meter is constructed for service to a planned
industrial development a prepayment of capacity fees may be calculated by the
Superintendent of Water for payment by the developers or applicants. This
payment must be collected prior to the connection to the master meter. If a
prepayment is made to the Village, the developers or applicants shall be
entitled to a reimbursement of such capacity charges from parcels connecting to
the water main served by the master meter. To be eligible for such
reimbursement, connections to the service shall be made within ten years from
completion of the water main. This reimbursement, minus an administrative fee,
will be paid from capacity charges collected by the Municipality for such
connections.
      (12)   For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises from which
connection is made with the Municipality’s sewerage system or which begins to
discharge sewage, any industrial waste; water or other liquids into the
Municipality’s sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, upon enactment
of this chapter, a charge for water shall be made, pursuant to this chapter,
the same to be a per diem rate amount based upon the minimum charge per month
from the time such sewer connection is made, or such discharge into
Municipality’s sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, is begun, until
the next following regular period. However, should the measured private or
public service exceed the minimum charge, the corresponding measured rate or
rates shall be charged. (Ord. 7-92. Passed 5-4-92.)
   (f)   Front Footage Fee/Main Line Charge. Each applicant for a water tap at
the time of application shall pay the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00) per front
foot of the property to be served within the Municipality, provided that this
charge shall not be imposed for the replacement of a tap or increase in size of
an existing tap and provided further, that this charge shall not be imposed if
the owner of the property concerned can show that he or his predecessor in
title paid, or is paying a special assessment for the construction of any of
the water mains which provide such service or at his own expense construct any
of the water mains which provide such service.

         (Ord. 61-13. Passed 11-12-13.)
939.11 LEAK CREDIT PROGRAM.
   (a)   Program Introduction.  All water lines and plumbing on the outlet side
of the water meter are considered "private" and are the responsibility of the
customer/property owner. However, the Village recognizes leaks in water lines,
plumbing, and water-related equipment occur-despite proper maintenance and
diligence on the part of the customer/property owner.
   (b)   Circumstances Under Which an Adjustment to a Utility Bill Will Be
Considered. In order to provide financial relief to customers/property owners
who experience sizeable water leaks, the Village will consider granting an
adjustment to the customer's sanitary sewer bill under the following
circumstances:
      (1)   The leak did not result from a willful or negligent act on the part
of the customer/property owner.
      (2)   The customer can demonstrate the leak was repaired within ten (10)
days of discovery.
      (3)   The customer's Village utility account is current, unless prior
arrangements have been made in accordance with another Village program.
      (4)   The customer has not received a leak adjustment within the past
thirty-six (36) months.
      (5)   The customer completes and submits a "Credit for Leak Adjustment"
form, and required information, along with proof of the repair, within thirty
(30) days of making the repair. Forms can be obtained online at www.obetz.oh.us
or by calling the Village of Obetz Utility Office at (614) 491-1080.
 
    (c)   Calculating the Leak Credit for Leak Adjustments.
      (1)   As used in this section
         A.   "Leak Amount" means the difference in water usage during the
month in which the leak occurred and the average usage of the customer/property
owner. Calculating the Leak Amount varies based on the amount of historical
data available. The Leak Amount is expressed in thousands of gallons.
         B.   "Leak Credit" means the amount of money that will be applied to a
customer/property owner's utility account.
      (2)   Calculating the Leak Credit for utility accounts with more than one
year of data. The Village will take the past usage amounts for the same month
as the leak occurred for all prior years available in the Village electronic
records to create an average amount of water used. The average amount used will
be subtracted from the month during which the leak occurred to get the Leak
Amount. The Village will then multiply the Leak Amount, expressed in thousands
of gallons, by the current commodity rate for the sewer portion of the
customer/property owner's utility bill to arrive at the Leak Credit amount.
      (3)   Calculating the Leak Credit for utility accounts with less than one
year of data. The Village will take the past usage amounts for all months of
available data to create an average amount of water used. The average amount of
water used will be subtracted from the month during which the leak occurred to
get the Leak Amount. For accounts with no data, the Village will assume an
average water usage of 7,000 gallons to calculate the Leak Amount. The Village
will then multiply the Leak Amount, expressed in thousands of gallons, by the
current commodity rate for the sewer portion of the bill to arrive at the Leak
Credit amount.
   (d)   Program Rules.
      (1)   The Village will only issue Leak Credit for the sewer commodity
portion of the Leak Amount.
      (2)   The Village will not issue a Leak Credit under $10; $10 is the
minimum Leak Credit that may be issued.
      (3)   The Village will not issue a Leak Credit in excess of $1,000;
$1,000 is the maximum Leak Credit that may be issued.
      (4)   The Village will not issue a credit of any type for water features
(fountains, ponds, etc.), swimming pools, and hot tubs.
      (5)   The Village will not issue a Leak Credit for more than one (1)
billing period.
      (6)   The Village assumes no responsibility for damage, repairs, or
inspections necessitated by leaks.
      (7)   The Village retains the right to inspect both the leak and repair.
   (e)   Final Decision on Issuing a Leak Credit. The Administrator has the
final decision on whether or not to issue a Leak Credit.
(Ord. 20-14. Passed 5-12-14.)
939.12 OBETZ UTILITY PAYMENT PROGRAM.
   (a)   Program Creation. The Obetz Utility Payment Program (the "Program") is
hereby created.
   (b)   Applicability. The Program is applicable only to the Village-operated
water, sewer, and refuse utilities (the "Utility Services").
   (c)   Applying for Assistance. Any water, sewer, or refuse customer may
apply for assistance under the Program provided they meet the following
conditions:
      (1)   The Utility Service(s) must be at risk of disconnection for failure

time in any three (three) year period.
      (3)   The customer must submit an application, including all information
required therein, and gain approval from the Village Administrator to
participate in the Program.
   (d)   Calculating the Payments.  The Program allows customers, when
approved, to pay the customer's regularly occurring bills; and, to spread the
amount subject to the repayment plan over four months. For example, a Program
participant with a $1,000 balance as of April 30th who is approved to
participate in the Program during the month of April would pay:
 
    Regular Bill $1000 balance payments Total Monthly Payment
May    $85.00       $250.00                $335.00
June   $78.00       $250.00                $328.00

agreement with the Village promising to make the required payments under the
Program.
   (f)   Start of Repayment. The customer shall begin making the required
Program payments the month after the application to participate in the Program
is approved by the Administrator.
   (g)   Late Payments. If the participant is late with a payment under the
Program, the Village shall disconnect the participant's utility services, at a
time convenient for the Village. At the time the Utility Services are
disconnected, the full outstanding utility balance shall become due and
payable. The customer shall pay the full outstanding utility balance before the
Village will restore service.
   (h)   Disconnection Due to Violation of Other Rules or Laws. Participation
in the Program will not prevent the Village from disconnecting a participant's
utility services for the violation of any other rule or law established by the
Village relating to the water, sewer, or refuse utilities. (Ord. 21-14. Passed
5-12-14.)
939.99 PENALTY.
   Any individual, company or industry that violates or fails to comply with a
provision of this chapter, other than provisions applicable to officials or
employees of the Village of Obetz, shall be prosecuted within the limits
provided by state and local laws. Each day that a violation continues after due
notice has been served shall be deemed a separate offense. Violations shall be

943.01 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    Kilowatt-Hour (Kwh) - 1,000 watts of electric consumption for 1 hour.
   (b)   Watt - An electrical measurement of power. A kilowatt (Kw) equals
1,000 watts. (Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-3-00.)
943.02 UNITS OF ELECTRICITY MEASUREMENT.
   The general unit of electricity measurement shall be a volume measured in
increments of Kwh and a demand measured in increments of Kw. (Ord. 14-00.
Passed 4-3-00.)
943.03 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   (a)   A copy of the Electric Service. Power Rates and Rules and the
schedules applicable to the Customer's class of business will be furnished upon
request at the Electric Utility's office and the Customer shall elect upon
which applicable schedule the Customer desires to be served.
   (b)   Before the Electric Utility shall be required to furnish service, the
Electric Utility may request that a Customer submit written specifications of
electrical apparatus to be operated by service, and to furnish the Electric
Utility a detailed sketch giving the location of the Customer's facilities.
Such requests will be limited to specific instances where such information
significantly assists the Electric Utility in designing and sizing its local
facilities. The Electric Utility may also request the Customer to provide
estimates of the quality and quantity of future electricity requirements. The
Electric Utility shall be entitled to rely on these estimates for purposes of
making plant, facility and equipment modifications as well as for securing
electric power supply, delivery and financing sufficient to meet the Customer's
identified needs. In the event that the Customer's actual electricity load and
usage does not materialize as estimated by the Customer, the rates and charges
specified in this Chapter may be adjusted by the Electric Utility so that the
Electric Utility fully recovers any unavoidable cost incurred by the Electric
Utility in reliance upon the Customer's estimate of future requirements.
   (c)   Written agreements will be required, before service will be commenced
from each Customer with annual average demand greater than 100 Kw.
   (d)   Service hereunder shall only be available from the installed
facilities of the Electric Utility. The Electric Utility does not assure a
continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity. The Electric Utility
operates and maintains a delivery system and obtains it electricity from
suppliers through contractual arrangements. Failed performance by such
suppliers may affect the Electric Utility's ability to provide electric service
and Customers that require a continuous supply of electricity assume the risk
of such interruptions or curtailment of electric supply unless otherwise agreed
specifically by the Electric Utility.
   (e)    When the Customer desires delivery of energy at more than one point,
each delivery point will be billed separately under a schedule applicable to
the Customer's class of business at such delivery point. (Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-
3-00.)
943.04 SERVICE CONNECTION.
   (a)    The Electric Utility will, when requested to furnish service
designate the location of its service connection. The Customer's wiring must,
except for those cases listed below, be brought outside the building wall
nearest the Electric Utility's service wires so as to be readily accessible
thereto. When a Customer desires that energy be delivered at a point or in a
manner other than that designated by the Electric Utility, the Customer shall
pay the additional cost of same.
   (b)    Where service is supplied from an underground distribution system
which has been installed at the Electric Utility's expense within the limits of
municipal streets, the Customer shall make arrangements with the Electric
Utility for the Electric Utility to supply and install a continuous run of
cable conductors including necessary ducts from the manhole or connection box
to the inside of the building wall. The Customer shall pay the cost of
installing the portion of cable and duct from the curb line to the terminus or
cable inside the building.
(Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-3-00.)
943.05 EXTENSION OF SERVICE.
   (a)    The electrical facilities of the Electric Utility may be extended or
be expanded to supply electric service when the revenue is sufficient to
justify the cost of making such additions, or in lieu of sufficient revenue the
Electric Utility may require a long-term contract or contribution, monthly
minimum charge, definite and written guarantee, from a Customer or group of
Customers in addition to any minimum payment required by the appropriate rate
schedule as may be necessary. This requirement may also be applied to cover the
payment by the Customer of the cost of tapping existing transmission or
distribution lines for electric service or for reservation of electrical
capacity when such service or reservation will not otherwise provide sufficient
revenue to justify the cost of tapping said lines.
   (b)    The factors to be considered by the Electric Utility when justifying
the service extension, expansion or reservation contemplated above include, in
addition to the Electric Utility's estimates of the additional revenue to be
derived and the total additional investment in new or expanded facilities, the
voltage at which service will be delivered, other benefits or burdens accruing
to the Electric Utility as a result of the new or expanded facilities, the
degree of permanence of the load to be served and the salvageability of the
facilities to be installed. These factors will be applied without distinction
among kinds and classes of Customers, and Customers are assured that like costs
will be charged in like situations.
(Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-3-00.)
943.06 TEMPORARY SERVICE.
   The Electric Utility may supply temporary service when it has available
capacity. The Customer will purchase temporary service under any schedule
applicable to the Customer's class of business and will, in addition, pay to
the Electric Utility, in advance, the Electric Utility's estimated total cost
of installing and removing its facilities necessary for the temporary service.
The total cost will include all material, labor and overheads, with appropriate
credits being given to salvageable material and to facilities to be used in
subsequent permanent service.
(Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-3-00.)
943.07 USE OF ENERGY BY CUSTOMER.
   (a)    The schedules for electric energy given herein are classified by the

provided therein. A Customer may not change from one schedule to another during
the term of contract except with the consent of the Electric Utility.
   (b)    The service connections, transformers, meters and appliances supplied
by the Electric Utility for each Customer have a definite capacity and no
additions to the equipment, or load connected thereto, will be allowed except
by consent of the Electric Utility.
   (c)    The Customer shall install only motors, apparatus, or appliances that
are suitable for operation with the character of the service supplied by the
Electric Utility, and which shall not be detrimental to it. The Electric
Utility shall be the sole judge as to the suitability of apparatus or
appliances, and also as to whether the operation of such apparatus or
appliances is or will be detrimental to its general service.
   (d)    No attachment of any kind whatsoever may be made to the Electric
Utility's lines, poles, crossarms, structures, or other facilities without the
express written consent of the Electric Utility.
   (e)    The Customer shall not be permitted to operate the Customer's own
generating equipment in parallel with the Electric Utility's service except on
written permission of the Electric Utility. (Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-3-00.)
 
943.08 SPECIAL CONTRACTS.
   The Administrator is hereby authorized to enter into special contracts with
industrial and commercial customers for the sale of electricity for specified
periods of time and under mutually agreed to rates, terms and conditions; and
to return the cost of service of such supplies to the Municipality, including
but not limited to the cost of procurement, purchase, transportation, delivery
and accounting for the electricity supplied under this section.
(Ord. 14-00. Passed 4-3-00.)

months, the Administrator may decrease the customer charge after receiving a
written request from the customer and reviewing the circumstances.
   (b)   Minimum Monthly Charge. Bills computed under the above rate are
subject to the operation of a minimum monthly charge. The minimum monthly
charge is the sum of the customer charge plus the product of the demand charge
and the highest monthly billing demand in the last twelve months.
   (c)   Billing Demand. The monthly billing demand shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement for Wholesale Electric Service currently
with South Central Power Company dated September 1, 1998.
   (d)   Fuel Adjustment Charge. In addition to the charges set forth in the
above schedule, there shall be a Fuel Adjustment Charge as determined by the
Agreement for Wholesale Electric Service currently with South Central Power
Company dated September 1, 1998 on a monthly basis. This Fuel Adjustment Charge
will be billed upon a Kwh basis and will be included in the calculation of the
Customer's monthly bill.
   (e)   Purchased Power Adjustment. Monthly charges computed under this
schedule shall be adjusted for increases or decreases in the Electric Utility's
delivered cost of electrical energy arising from future changes in the rates
and charges established by agreements between the Electric Utility and its
suppliers. The above rates and charges have been established based on the
demand and energy charges contained in the Agreement for Wholesale Electric
Service currently with South Central Power Company dated September 1, 1998 and
considering the Electric Utility's other costs of providing service. This
adjustment provision shall be applied to alter the above rates and charges as a
result of any changes in the power supply charges contained in the Agreement
for Wholesale Electric Service currently with South Central Power Company dated
September 1, 1998 or as a result of any new power supply agreement entered into

of construction for all gas main extensions. Plans and installation shall be
subject to approval of the professional engineer representative of the
Administrator and subject to Council approval.

951.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Applicability.  This Chapter applies to all non-stormwater discharges
entering the storm drain system generated on any development and undeveloped
lands unless explicitly exempted by the Village of Obetz.
 
   (b)   Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of this Chapter is to
provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Obetz
through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage
system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and Ohio law.
Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed
entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution
and degradation of receiving waters. The impacts of these discharges adversely
affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and
other aquatic life, property values, and other uses of lands and waters. This
Chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into
the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with
requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit process. The objectives of this Chapter are to:
      (1)   Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4);
      (2)    Prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system; and,
      (3)    To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
surveillance, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this Chapter.
   (c)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this
Chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or interfere with any existing
easements, covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations,
ordinances or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However,
wherever this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
Chapter shall govern.
   (d)   Interpretation and Ultimate Responsibility. In their interpretation
and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be the minimum
requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power
granted by Ohio statutes. Where any terms or requirements of this Chapter may
be inconsistent or conflicting, the more restrictive requirement or
interpretation shall control. Compliance with this Chapter does not intend nor
imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no
contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. It is the
ultimate responsibility of the person to ensure that there will be no
contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants.
   (e)   Severability. The provisions of this Chapter are hereby declared to be
severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this Chapter or
the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be
held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or
application of this Chapter.
   (f)   Responsibility for Administration. The Administrator shall administer,
implement, and enforce the provisions of this Chapter. Any powers granted or
duties imposed upon the Village of Obetz may be delegated by the Administrator
to other persons in the Village of Obetz. (Ord. 34-09. Passed 12-14-09.)

person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4, or waters
of Ohio or of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or
waters of Ohio or of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this Chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
Administrator will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4
access. The violator may petition Council for a reconsideration and hearing
pursuant to the procedure outlined in Section
951.10(b). A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the
Village of Obetz.
(Ord. 34-09. Passed 12-14-09.)
951.05 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the Administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Ord. 34-09.
Passed 12-14-09.)
951.06 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability.  This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with commercial or industrial activity,
including construction activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)    Inspections authorized. The Administrator or authorized designees
are hereby authorized to inspect such facilities subject to regulation under
this Chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this
Chapter. If the Administrator or authorized designees determine that inspection
of a facility is needed, the Administrator or authorized designees shall notify
the property owner, the operator of such facility, and/or any other parties
who, in the sole determination of the Administrator or authorized designees,
directly benefit from the storm sewer system, that such inspection is required
as follows:
         A.   Written notice.  The Administrator or authorized designees shall
cause written notice to be served on the property owner, the operator of such
facility, and/or any other parties benefiting from the storm water system
notifying such parties that inspection is necessary as set forth in subsections
(b)(2) through (5) below, and that response to the inspection notice should be
delivered to the Administrator or authorized designees within fourteen (14)
days of the notice. If a discharger has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to
representatives of municipality. The notice shall be served upon the property
owner, the operator of such facility, and/or benefited parties at the tax
billing address for each respective premises reflected upon the records of the
Franklin County Auditor. Service shall be accomplished by any means permitted
for service of Summons under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. Each property
affected by such notice shall also be posted with such notice by the
Administrator or authorized designees.
         B.   Unknown address. In those instances where the address of the
owner is unknown, it shall be sufficient to publish a notice once a week in a
newspaper of general circulation in Franklin County, Ohio setting forth the
substance of the notice and time frame for compliance. The time frame for
compliance shall be no less than fourteen (14) days after the publication.
         C.   Entrance without prior notice. The Administrator or authorized
designees may enter the property and inspect the property without prior written
notice as set forth above if there is an emergency, the property is open to the
general public, or the subject property has a history of regulatory oversight,
as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator in consultation with
the Solicitor.
         D.   Unreasonable delays.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the
Administrator or authorized designees access to a permitted facility are
violations of a stormwater discharge permit and of this Chapter. A person who
is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
Administrator or authorized designees reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this Chapter.
         E.   Refusal of access. If the Administrator or authorized designees
have been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is
discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to
verify compliance with this Chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to
protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then
the Village of Obetz may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Administrator or authorized
designees ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Administrator or authorized designees shall have the right to
set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility's stormwater discharge.
      (4)   The Administrator or authorized designees have the right to require
the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary at the discharger's
expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its
own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Administrator or authorized
designee and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
         (Ord. 34-09. Passed 12-14-09.)
951.07 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (a)   The Administrator may adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility that may cause or contribute
to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters
of the Unites States.
   (b)   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of structural and non-structural
BMPs identified by the Administrator under Section 951.07(a) herein.
   (c)   Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, structural and non-structural BMPs, in additional to those
required by Section
951.07(b) herein, to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system.
   (d)   Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity
shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this Section. These BMPs
shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for
compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 34-09. Passed 12-14-09.)
951.08 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 34-09. Passed 12-14-09.)
951.09 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   (a)   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person has
information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting
or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater,
the storm drain system, or waters of Ohio or of the United States said person
shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. Said person shall also take immediate steps to ensure
no recurrence of the discharge or spill.
   (b)   Hazardous Materials. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies
and/or other appropriate agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch
services.
   (c)   Non-hazardous Materials. In the event of a release of non-hazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Administrator in person or by phone
within 24 hours of the occurrence. Such notification shall include the nature,
quantity, and time of occurrence of the discharge. Notifications in person or
by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
Village of Obetz within three (3) business days of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. A copy
of the written record shall be forwarded to the Administrator upon request.
   (d)   Failure to Provide Notification. Failure to provide notification of a
release of provided in subsections (b) and (c) herein shall be deemed a
violation of the Chapter.
(Ord. 34-09. Passed 12-14-09.)

1101.01 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known and be cited and referred to as the
“Subdivision Regulations of Obetz”, and shall hereinafter be referred to as
“the subdivision regulations.”
1101.02 JURISDICTION.
   This Chapter shall be applicable throughout the Municipal planning
jurisdiction. The Municipality's planning jurisdiction comprises the area
within the corporate boundaries of the Municipality of Obetz, Ohio and to all
subdivisions, which are subject to extraterritorial jurisdiction, which the
Municipality may choose to exercise under the provision of Section 711.09, Ohio
Revised Code.
    1101.03 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The provisions of these Subdivision Regulations were adopted by Ordinance
91-02 and became effective on October 21, 2002.
1101.04 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose and intent of the subdivision regulations are to guide and
facilitate the orderly, beneficial growth of the community by assuring the
orderly subdivision of land and its development, and to promote the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare.
 
1101.05 RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE.
   This Subdivision Ordinance is adopted in whole and is a replacement of the
previous Subdivision Ordinance of Obetz, as amended, which was repealed by the
City Council effective October 21, 2022.
1101.06 RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING.
   It is the intention of Council that the subdivision regulations shall
reflect the vision and policies of the comprehensive plan, land-use plan, and
all other planning documents formally adopted by Council. While the Council
reaffirms its commitment that the subdivision regulations be in conformity with
adopted planning policies, the Council hereby expresses its intent that neither
this nor any amendment to it may be challenged on the basis of any alleged
nonconformity with any planning document.
1101.07 SEVERABILITY.
   Each chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other
divisible part of the Subdivision Regulations is hereby declared to be
severable and if any such chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause,
phrase, or other divisible part is declared unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgment or decree,
such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining
chapters, sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases, or other devisable
part of these Regulations since the same would have been enacted without the
incorporation into these Regulations of such unconstitutional or invalid
chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other devisable part.
1101.08 PLATTING REQUIRED.
(a)   No land shall be subdivided except in compliance with this chapter and
with the provisions of the Zoning Code.
   (b)   No land shall be subdivided within the corporate limits of Obetz
until:
(1)   The subdivider shall submit plats as described in this chapter;
(2)   Said plats have been approved as provided herein; and
(3)   The approved plats are recorded in the County Record of Plats.
(c)   No Certificate of Zoning Compliance or Certificate of Occupancy shall be
issued for any parcel or plat of land which was created by subdivision after
the effective date of, and not in conformity with, the provisions of this
chapter, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with these
regulations and other applicable Municipal codes.
1101.09 CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   Where conflicts exist between requirements of these Subdivision Regulations
and other ordinances adopted by Council, the most strict interpretation as
interpreted by the Zoning Inspector shall apply and thereby supersede the less
strict requirements.
1101.10 COORDINATION OF PLANNED DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL WITH SUBDIVISION
APPROVAL.
   The planned district development approach is greatly encouraged. It is the
intent of these regulations that subdivision review be carried out
simultaneously with the review of planned district zoning applications under
Chapter
1159 of the Zoning Ordinance. The subdivision regulations may be modified to
the degree necessary to accomplish the objective and standards required for
planned districts. Nothing within this section, however, shall exempt the
developer from the requirements of subdivision plat approval as specified in
this chapter. Subdivision regulations modified to the degree necessary to
accomplish the objectives and standards required for planned districts must be
approved by Council at the time of Council planned district approval.

1109.01 APPLICATION REQUIRED.
   Application for subdivision must be submitted to the Zoning Inspector and
the following procedure shall be followed with regard to the submittal, review,
and approval of subdivision plats.
1109.02 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE AND CONCEPTUAL PLAN.
   (a)   Prior to submission of a preliminary plat, the subdivider must meet
with the Zoning Inspector, Municipal Engineer, Economic Development Director,
and Administrator to discuss the comprehensive plan, zoning code and
subdivision regulations of the Municipality.
   
   (b)   Following the pre-application, the subdivider must submit a Conceptual
Plan and a copy of the preliminary deed restrictions to the Zoning Inspector
for review. This step does not require formal application fee or filing of the
plat with the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Zoning Inspector may request
other plans and data relative to the proposed development, if needed.
      (1)   The Conceptual Plan shall contain the following information:
         A.   Proposed name of subdivision
         B.   Owner’s name
         C.   Location
         D.   North point
         E.   Vicinity map
         F.   Boundaries of subdivision and its acreage
         G.   Existing and proposed streets
         H.   Lot layout and existing natural and manmade features such as soil
types, vegetation, general topography, existing easements, railroad rights of
way, and service facilities
1109.03 SUBMITTAL OF PRELIMINARY PLATS.
   (a)   Unless exempted per
1111.04, the subdivider shall prepare and submit fifteen copies of a
preliminary plat, together with the supplementary material as required by
Section
1111.02. Said plat shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector at least forty-five
days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered.
   (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review said plat and act
thereon. The Commission may approve the plat as submitted or modified, it may
conditionally approve the plat and stipulate the conditions of such approval,
or it may disapprove the plat and express the reasons therefore. The action of
the Commission shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plat. One copy
shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained on file by the
Zoning Inspector.
   (c)   Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the
final plat and improvement plans, but rather shall be deemed an expression of
approval of the layout as a guide to preparation of the final plat.
   (d)   Review of the preliminary plat is based on conformance with present
zoning and general conformance with the improvement requirements as stipulated
herein.
   (e)   Whether it is proposed to develop the tract in one phase or in
sections or stages, layout of the entire tract is required.
1109.04 SUBMITTAL OF FINAL PLATS.
   (a)   Final plats shall be subsequent to and substantially in conformance
with a previously approved preliminary plat. A final plat may constitute only
that portion of the project which is proposed for recording and development at
the time. Final plats shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector within
eighteen months after approval of the preliminary plat or such approval shall
become null and void unless an extension of time has been granted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission upon showing of cause. Only one extension of
time may be granted for a period not to exceed eighteen months.
   (b)   Final plats shall be prepared by a registered surveyor or engineer and
fifteen copies of the plat and supporting data as required in Section
1111.03 shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector at least forty-five days
prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered.
   (c)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall, within a period of time, not
longer than sixty days from the receipt of the final plat containing all
revisions as required by the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Municipal
Staff, review same and recommend either approval, approval with conditions, or
disapproval. The plat together with the Commission’s recommendation shall then
be immediately forwarded to Council, and heard by Council within sixty days of
receipt of the plat as reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (d)   Before any plat is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
developer shall give notice to the State Director of Transportation of the
proposed improvements and obtain a letter from the State Director of
Transportation stating that: This property is not within 300 feet of the
centerline of a proposed new highway, or within 500 feet of the centerline of a
highway for which changes are proposed; or this property is within these limits
but that acquisition of the land at this time is not in the public interest. If
the State Director of Transportation notifies the Commission that the State
shall proceed to acquire the land needed, then the Commission may refuse to
approve the plat, according to provisions of Section 5511.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code. At the request of the subdivider, the Commission may give
conditional approval and allow the developer to proceed with completion of the
plat. However, it shall be clearly at the subdivider's own risk and the
conditional approval shall be withdrawn if the State Director of Transportation
proceeds to acquire the land. If the State Director of Transportation notifies
the Commission that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest, or
upon expiration of a 120 day period from date of notice to the State Director
or any extension thereof agreed upon by the State Director of Transportation
and the property owner, the Commission shall, if the plat is in conformance
with all provisions of these Subdivision Regulations, approve the plat. A copy
of correspondence to the State Director shall be mailed to the Zoning
Inspector. The correspondence to the State Director shall indicate the 120 day
notification deadline.
   (e)   Within sixty days of Planning and Zoning Commission’s approval,
Council shall either approve or disapprove the plat. Should Council approve the
final plat, the subdivider shall deliver to the Clerk a bond and other items as
required by Section
1117. Upon review and approval of said items by the Municipal Engineer, the
Mayor and Clerk shall sign the final plat and it may be recorded. The placement
of the Mayor's signature on the plat shall constitute final approval of the
subdivision. The required bonds shall be posted and the plat placed on record
within six months from the date of Council's approval or the plat shall be null
and void. Provided, however, the said time may be extended by Council for good
cause.
   If Council disapproves the plat, it shall be returned to the Planning and
Zoning Commission with recommendations for modification. A majority vote of
Council is required to overturn a final plat approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (f)   A copy of the final plat as recorded shall be submitted to the Zoning
Inspector. Upon completion of the subdivision, "as built plans" based on
Municipal inspection records and prepared by the developer shall be submitted
to the Zoning Inspector in mylar form.
   (g)   Application for building permits for lots within the subdivision shall
not be submitted until after the plat is recorded and either improvements
completed, or a bond is posted for one hundred percent (100%) of the estimated
construction and inspection cost of the improvements.

1113.01 GENERAL.
   The regulations in Sections
1113.01 through
 1113.20 shall control the manner in which streets, lots and other elements of
a subdivision are arranged on the land. These design controls shall help insure
convenient and safe streets, creation of usable lots, provision of space for

of attractive and functional neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the
undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard growth.
1113.02 STREET DESIGN.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the major thoroughfare plan of the Municipality or subsequent
amendments thereof, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, topographical conditions, and public convenience and safety;
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served
by such streets. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation within
the subdivision, but the minor streets shall be laid out that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged. The subdivider shall provide within the
boundaries of the subdivision plat, by dedication, the necessary right of way
for the widening, continuance or alignment of such streets in conformity with
the major thoroughfare plan.
1113.03 HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT.
   (a)   The radius of curvature on the centerline of streets shall not be less
than the following:

   (a)   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
      (1)   Cul-de-sac streets shall not generally exceed 600 feet in length
and have a minimum length of 160 feet. The closed end shall be a paved
turnaround having a minimum radius of fifty feet to the outer pavement edge and
a radius of sixty feet to the right-of-way line. Pavement shall cover all area
within the outer pavement edge. However, cul-de-sac streets with a radius of
eighty feet or greater may have an open space in the center for landscaping, so
long as maintenance responsibilities of such open space are provided by
adjacent property owners or the developer through deed covenant. 
      (2)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-
end streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuous street plan, and
only if a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the Municipal Engineer in
design, maintenance and removal is provided. Temporary dead-end streets longer
than 200 feet shall not be permitted.
      (3)   Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided,
the other half shall be platted.
      (4)   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial street, a marginal access
street may be required to control access to the arterial from lots fronting on
it. Access is controlled in the interest of public safety and to maintain the
design capacity of the street system. Points of access to the arterial shall be
spaced at a minimum of 1,000 feet. A planting strip having a minimum width of
twenty feet shall be provided between the pavement of the arterial street and
the pavement of the marginal access street. The Planning Commission, before
approving minimum width for the planting strip, shall take into account the
physical location of major public utility lines as they relate to the existing
and potential development along both sides of the highway. The minimum width of
the marginal access right of way shall be thirty feet.
      (5)   Alleys may be approved in residential districts. Alleys may be
required in commercial and industrial districts if other provisions cannot be

right- of-way width of twenty feet and a minimum pavement width of twenty feet.
1113.08 STREET INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of street
intersections:
      (1)   Streets shall be designed to intersect at ninety degrees. Streets
shall remain in the right angle of intersection for 100 feet beyond the point
of intersection.
      (2)   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street, the number of intersections with the arterial shall
be kept to a minimum and shall not be located less than 1,000 feet apart,
measured from centerline to centerline. Intersections of local streets with
local or collector streets shall not be located less than 200 feet apart;
intersections of collector streets with collector streets shall not be located
less than 300 feet apart. Intersections of any street with arterial streets
shall be located not less than 1,000 feet apart.
      (3)   Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than two streets
shall be prohibited.
      (4)   Four-way intersections of local streets should be avoided and
three-way or T-intersections should be encouraged wherever possible.
      (5)   The minimum pavement radius at intersections shall be twenty-five
feet; the minimum right-of-way radius shall be twenty-five feet, except for
industrial or major street intersections which shall have a minimum of thirty-
five feet.
      (6)   Safe sight distances shall be provided at all intersections. Earth
banks and vegetation (including trees) shall be removed, as deemed necessary,
in connection with the grading of the public right of way to assure safe sight
distances. A safe sight distance shall be assured by allowing that no sign,
fence, wall, shrub or other obstruction to vision exceeding three feet in
height above the established street grade, shall be erected, planted or
maintained within the area of a corner lot that is included between the lines
of the intersecting streets and a straight line connecting them at points
thirty feet in distance from the intersection of the street lines.
1113.09 STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local
streets. The intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or
collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible
interference with traffic movement on the streets, shall be located not less
than 100 feet from the intersection of an arterial of collector street with any
other street, and shall be spaced not less than 200 feet from each other. The
Commission may require marginal access streets to provide maximum safety and
convenience.
1113.10 STREETS FOR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so that no
industrial traffic will be directed onto any residential streets. The
intersections of service streets from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall not be less than 100 feet from the intersection of the arterial
or collector street with any other street. Streets shall be planned to be
extended to the boundaries of any adjoining land planned for industry, except
for sever physical conditions or if the Planning and Zoning Commission finds
such extension is not in accord with the approved plan of the area.   
1113.11 BLOCKS.
   (a)   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of
blocks:
      (1)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria established in this Chapter, and shall be arranged to
accommodate lots and building sties of the size and character required for the
district as set forth in these Subdivision Regulations or the zoning
regulations and to provide for the required community facilities.
      (2)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, shall be approved
by the Planning and Zoning Commission when properly designed and located and
when the maintenance of interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
      (3)   No block length shall be longer than 1,500 feet nor less than 500
feet.
      (4)   Where blocks are over 900 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width with a paved sidewalk at or near the halfway point
shall be required, if necessary, to provide proper access to schools,
recreational areas, shopping centers and other facilities. All sidewalks in
crosswalk easements shall be constructed according to the Municipal Standard
Construction Drawings.
1113.12 LOTS.
   (a)   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots:
      (1)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots shall
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding development.
      (2)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
regulations or the zoning district in which they are located and the use for
which they are intended.
      (3)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where the Planning and Zoning Commission
determines that a variation to this rule would provide a better layout.
      (4)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the
Planning and Zoning Commission determines that it is essential to provide
separation of residential development from arterial streets. When double
frontage lots are created, a common fence, mounding, and landscaping will be
required.
      (5)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy- five feet, in order to allow proper setback lines from both streets.
      (6)   Every lot shall abut a public street, and narrow reserve strips of
land which are intended by the owner of a plat to prevent access to streets or
the extension of sewer, water or storm drain lines from one plat to another are
prohibited.
      (7)   No lots shall be formed or building permitted at the closed end of
a temporary or stub-end street which would tend to prevent the appropriate
extension of such road or street into an adjoining territory.
1113.13 EASEMENTS.
   Easements at least twenty feet in width centered along rear or side lot
lines shall be provided where necessary for sanitary sewers, water mains and
storm sewers. Easements at least ten feet in width centered along rear or side
lot lines shall be provided wherever necessary for gas mains and electric
lines, unless otherwise requested by the respective utility company. Easements
shall also be provided as required by the Planning and Zoning Commission along
every water course, drainage channel or stream within a subdivision. All plats
shall contain a restriction requiring that no structures, plantings, etc. will
be permitted in the easement area.
1113.14 PUBLIC SITES, OPEN SPACE AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   (a)   Generally. Parks, recreational facilities and public open spaces are
necessary and desirable elements of public welfare. Public health, safety and
welfare require at least ten acres of such land per 1,000 population, developed
with the combination of facilities determined by the Municipal Engineer to meet
the national standards tempered by specific needs of the community, as outlined
in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan.
   It is the purpose of this section to provide necessary authority to the
Planning and Zoning Commission to require developers and builders of individual
residences and commercial buildings to share in the cost of obtaining land and
developing parks, recreational facilities and open spaces.    At the option of
the Planning and Zoning Commission, a developer will be required to either:
      (1)   Dedicate a portion of the land to be developed;
      (2)   Pay a fee in lieu of such land dedication; and/or
      (3)   Provide off-site open space in lieu of such land dedication; and/or
      (4)   Develop a park or recreation area per specifications provided by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (b)   The amount of  acreage to be set aside shall comply with the following
schedule:
 
                 PERCENT OF GROSS
ZONING DISTRICT  DEVELOPABLE ACRES
                 (minimum standards)
SR, R-1          15.0
R-2, R-3, & R-12 20.0
PRD & PUD        20.0
   Such lands may be deeded to the Municipality and thereby developed and
managed by the Municipality or held, developed and maintained by a private
association, the bylaws and creation of which shall be by approval of Council
as an element of the subdivision platting process. Title to dedicated land
shall be transferred to the Municipality within sixty (60) days of final plat
approval.
   Where a park or playground which is shown on an official map or in the Park
and Recreation Master Plan for future use is located in whole or in part in the
proposed subdivision, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require the
dedication of such area within the subdivision or payment in lieu thereof as
provided in subsection (c) below.
   (c)   Fees In-Lieu of Dedication. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
require payment in lieu of dedication when such payment would better fit the
overall recreational plans and needs of the community. The amount of fees to be
paid shall be equal to the assessed value of the acreage that would have been
dedicated to the Municipality under the land dedication requirement.
   (d)   Payment, Deposit and Use of Fees. Fees in-lieu of land dedication
shall be paid to the Municipality within sixty (60) days following final plat
approval. Such fees shall be placed in a special fund the records of which
shall be available for public inspection. Such funds shall only be used by the
Municipality for the acquisition and development of public parks, recreation
facilities, and open space.
   (e)   Additional Reservation of Public Land. Where adopted planning
documents recommend sites for public schools, parks or other public facilities,
including open space, such lands shall be set in reserve by the owner.
(Ord. 38-04. Passed 10-11-04.)
1113.15 DEVELOPMENT ALONG RAILROAD LINES AND LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAYS.
    Industrial, commercial and/or residential building sites along railroads
and limited access highways shall be of sufficient size to ensure suitable
depth for such building development and uses. Streets or roads serving such
development along railroads and limited access highways shall be so located as
to not interfere with possible future construction of grade crossing or grade
separation bridges of perpendicular streets. In residential developments a
buffer strip at least twenty-five feet in depth in addition to the normal lot
required shall be provided along railroads and limited access highways. This
strip shall be designated for screening only and suitable plantings must be
provided.
1113.16 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be subject to all the
requirements of these regulations that are appropriate to the planning of all
subdivisions as well as additional standards required by the Planning and
Zoning Commission, and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards
established in the Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance. In imposing
additional standards upon nonresidential subdivisions, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall: consider the suitability of the area in regard to the type of
development; consider special requirements for street, sewers and other
requirements; make efforts to protect existing or proposed residential areas
from nuisance by requiring suitable lot dimensions with permanently landscaped
buffer strips when necessary.
1113.17 LAND SUITABILITY
   Proposals deemed unfavorable due to drainage, floodplain, topography,
geometry, geology, water supply, soil, health, environmental, utility line,
archaeological or historical site, or other characteristic shall not be
approved unless measures adequate to deal with the issues are detailed by the
subdivider, reviewed by the Municipal Engineer and Zoning Inspector, and
approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
1113.18 WETNESS AND DRAINAGE LIMITATION.
   (a)   Poorly drained soils. Soils recognized by these Regulations as having
wetness or high water table (HWT) limitations are listed below. Proposals shall
avoid leaching areas and homes with below grade floor elevations in these
soils. There may be other unfavorable soils or site conditions not on this list
which may also impact or limit development potential.

   (b)   The following note may be required on the Final Plat in order to alert
lot owners of development issues or restrictions: NOTE: Prior to the
construction of the footing/foundation for the residential building to be
constructed on each of the lots, the builder of such structure shall confer
with the Municipal Engineer for the purpose of determining if special
foundation and/or basement construction techniques and/or materials are to be
employed on such lot. 
1113.19 FORESTED AREAS.
   Preservation of remaining forested areas is strongly encouraged,
particularly along riparian corridors. Existing riparian trees should be
maintained to a depth of 120 feet from the watercourse. Development impacts may
be minimized with proper construction and urban forestry management practices.
Care should be taken to avoid safety and maintenance liability for future
owners. Tree planting is encouraged, combined with vegetative filter strips
along perennial streams (as established by the USGS).
1113.20 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION AREA.
   (a)    Purpose. The purpose of a Watercourse Protection Area is to promote
the public health and safety by protecting surface and groundwater quality. By
establishing a forested buffer along stream banks, the Watercourse Protection
Area filters stormwater runoff before it reaches the waterway, provides high-
quality stream habitats, reduces flood impacts, enhances environmental and
community quality of life.
    
   (b)   Stream bank buffer and transition area. The filtering action of the
Watercourse Protection Area will be accomplished by establishing two levels of
buffering – the stream bank buffer and the transition area.
      (1)   The stream bank buffer is intended to protect and promote a
forested corridor along protected watercourses. The buffer typically is a
natural area that serves a host of ecological and aesthetic functions such as
establishing root systems that reduce soil erosion, filtering stormwater
pollutants from the waterway, and providing shade from mature trees, which is
important to surface and water habitat. The stream bank buffer shall be 120
feet, as measured from the ordinary high-water mark, and shall apply to the
following waterways: Alum Creek and Big Walnut Creek.
      (2)   The transition area is the outer level of filtering. It is also
intended to protect the stream bank buffer from damage due to surface runoff
from development and grade change. The transition area shall be 25 feet.
Significant impervious surfaces, such as parking lots, are not permitted in the
transition area. Other impervious surfaces should be kept to a maximum of 10
percent of the transition area. Impervious surfaces are any surface that cannot
effectively absorb or infiltrate rainfall such as roads and streets, parking
lots, roof tops, sidewalks and paved walkways.
   (c)   Vegetation: Plantings in the Watercourse Protection Area shall be
native to the specific area of the development site and follow prescribed best
management practices.

1115.01 GUARANTEE FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   All improvements required herein shall be constructed prior to the granting
of the final plat approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission; or the
subdivider shall furnish the Municipality with cash or a performance bond for
the amount of the estimated cost, as approved by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, of the ultimate installation of the improvements.
1115.02 CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE AND MATERIALS.
   The subdivider shall design and construct improvements not less than the
standards outlined in these regulations. The work shall be done under Municipal
inspection and shall be completed within the time fixed or agreed upon by the
Municipal Engineer. Inspection costs shall be borne entirely by the subdivider
according to the Municipal fee schedule. Materials shall meet the requirements
and shall be in accordance with the standards of the current volume of
“Construction and Material Specifications” of the Ohio Department of
Transportation and the “Standard Construction Drawings of Obetz.”
1115.03 MONUMENTS.
   Iron pins and permanent markers shall be set under the direction of a
registered surveyor at all changes in direction of all outside boundary lines
of the platted property and at all changes in direction of the right-of-way
lines. Iron pins shall be ¾-inch inside diameter, 30 inches long with a plastic
plug placed in the top bearing the initials of the surveyor. Permanent markers
shall be 1 inch inside diameter, material 30 inches long, buried six inches in
depth below final grade with a plastic plug placed in the top bearing the
initials of the surveyor. A minimum of four permanent markers shall be set. All
monumentation shall meet the minimum standards for boundary surveys in the
State of Ohio.
1115.04 STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   All streets shall be graded to their full width, including side slopes, and
improved in conformance with the standards given or referred to in these
regulations.
1115.05 STREET WIDTH.
   Minimum street pavement widths shall conform to the standards given in
Section
1113.05. Where pavement widths greater than those specified in Section
1113.05 are deemed necessary by the Municipal Engineer because potential growth
would cause extension and greater use of the street, then the developer shall
provide a greater than minimum pavement width. The reimbursement to the
developer for the extra width of the street shall be made in accordance to
procedure established by the Planning and Zoning Commission with the approval
of Council. It is the intent of these Subdivision Regulations that future
benefitting developers shall reimburse the original developer, or the
Municipality if the Municipality participated in the financing of the original
over sizing of the street.
   In cases where pavement widths greater than the minimum set forth in Section
1113.05 are deemed necessary by the Municipal Engineer to serve existing
development or traffic flows, the Municipality shall bear the extra cost of
providing the greater width required.
1115.06 STREET SPECIFICATIONS.
   Street subgrade, base course and surface course materials and construction
standards shall follow the minimums as set forth in the “Standard Construction
Drawings” of the Municipality as provided by the Municipal Engineer.
1115.07 STREET CURBS AND GUTTERS.
   Curbs and gutters shall be required on all residential, commercial and
industrial streets of proposed subdivisions. Curbs and gutters shall be
constructed in conformance with the current volume “Construction and Material
Specifications” of the Ohio Department of Transportation and the “Standard
Construction Drawings” of the Municipality.
1115.08 WATER SUPPLY IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   The following requirements shall govern water supply provisions:
      (1)   Individual private wells are prohibited.
      (2)   All subdivisions shall be provided with a complete water
distribution system, built in conformance with the standards of the authorized
water service, including a connection for each lot, and fire hydrants spaced in
such a way that each dwelling is within 400 feet of a hydrant along a public
street. A complete loop type water distribution system shall be required unless
an exception is granted by the engineer of the authorized water service. Public
water distribution and public well systems shall meet the requirements of the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, as cited in Ohio R.C. 6111.44 through
6111.46.
      (3)   The size of water lines should not be based solely on present
needs, but rather on the contemplated population density and land uses of the
area to be served. When oversized water lines are deemed necessary by the
Municipal Engineer because of potential growth, to avoid dead end lines, or to
assure flow and pressure to the area, the developer shall provide sizes of
water lines greater than necessary for a singular subdivision. The
reimbursement to the developer for the extra size of the water lines shall be
made in accordance with the procedures established by the Planning and Zoning
Commission with the approval of Council. It is the intent of these Subdivision
Regulations that future benefitting developers shall reimburse the original
developer, or the Municipality if the Municipality participated in the
financing of the original over sizing of the water lines.
1115.09 SEWAGE TREATMENT.
   (a)   The following requirements shall govern sanitary sewage disposal
treatment.
      (1)   All laws, regulations and guidelines set forth by the Franklin
County Department of Health at the time of this enactment shall be followed and
any future laws, regulations, and guidelines deemed necessary for the
protection of public health shall be followed as they become effective.
      (2)   For all areas in the Municipality, public sanitary sewers shall be
installed to adequately serve all lots. The developer shall extend laterals
from the public system to the lot line. Public sewer system extensions shall
meet the requirements of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and Municipal
standards.
      (3)   The size of sanitary sewers should not be based solely on present
needs, but rather on the contemplated population density and land uses of the
area to be served. When oversized sanitary sewer sizes are deemed necessary by
the Municipal Engineer because of potential growth, the developer shall provide
a greater than necessary sanitary sewer. The reimbursement to the developer for
the extra size of the sanitary sewer shall be made in accordance with the
procedures established by the Planning and Zoning Commission with the approval
of Council. It is the intent of these Subdivision Regulations that future
benefitting developers shall reimburse the original developer, or the
Municipality if the Municipality participated in the financing of the original
over sizing of the sanitary sewer.
1115.10 DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall construct all necessary facilities including
underground pipe, inlets, catch basins, ditches or retention basins, as
determined by the Municipal Engineer in accordance with the Storm Water Design
Manual to provide for the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water and
maintenance of natural drainage courses. In cases of open drainage ditches,
there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right of way of
sufficient width to adequately handle potential maximum flows. Drainage
ditches, wherever possible, should be constructed with landscaped banks. All
storm drainage facilities within the subdivision shall connect to an adequate
drainage outlet. Sound engineering practice considering local physical
conditions or innovative techniques in variance with the Storm Water Design
Manual may be acceptable if approved by the Municipal Engineer.
1115.11 STORM SEWERS AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   (a)   The subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system and connect with
an adequate public storm sewer main. If such storm sewer systems are not
accessible, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the Municipal Engineer, in accordance with the
Storm Water Design Manual. However, in subdivisions containing residential lots
less than 15,000 square feet in area and in all commercial and industrial
districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed to service all
street and parking lot storm water runoff and be conducted to an approved
outfall.
   (b)   In all cases where no storm sewer mains exist, but their extension is
planned, in accordance with information contained in the current Comprehensive
Plan and the sewer facilities plan, then the developer must provide an
underground storm sewer system with approved outfall to service all streets and
parking lots, until such extension is made, at which time connection shall be
made.   
   (c)   The size of storm sewers should not be based solely on present needs,
but rather on the contemplated population density of the drainage basin. The
reimbursement to the developer for the oversized portion of the storm sewer
line shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the
Planning and Zoning Commission with the approval of Council. It is the intent
of these Subdivision Regulations that future benefitting developers shall
reimburse the original developer, or the Municipality if the Municipality
participated in the financing of the original over sizing of the storm sewer.
Storm drainage, including drain tile around basements shall not be permitted to
discharge into any sanitary sewer facility.
1115.12 CULVERTS AND BRIDGES.
   (a)   Where natural drainage channels intersect any street right of way, it
shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to have satisfactory bridges and
culverts constructed. Where culverts are required, the following minimum
requirements shall be observed:
      (1)   All culverts shall extend across the entire right-of-way width of
the proposed street and any additional width as determined by the Municipal
Engineer. The Municipal Engineer shall determine the cover over the culvert and
its capacity. The minimum diameter of a culvert pipe shall be twelve inches.
Depending on existing drainage conditions, head walls may be required.
      (2)   Driveway culverts shall have a minimum length of thirty feet. The
diameter shall be subject to the determination of the Municipal Engineer. The
driveway culverts shall be laid so as to maintain the flow lines of the ditch
or gutter.
1115.13 SURFACE WATER, EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   (a)   Where it is necessary to make changes in the contour of any land
proposed to be subdivided, developed or changed in use by grading, excavating
or the removal or destruction of the natural topsoil, trees, or other
vegetative covering thereon, the same shall be accomplished only after the
owner or his agent has submitted to the Municipal Engineer for approval a plan
for the surface water, erosion and sedimentation control and such plan has been
approved. Such plan shall follow the guidelines and policies of the Franklin

subdivisions in this category.
   (b)   Sidewalks in GC, RI, and LI areas. New subdivisions in this category
that are adjacent to residential areas are required to construct concrete
sidewalks as outlined in subsection (a) above. Sidewalks in other subdivisions
that do not border residential areas may have sidewalks on one or more sides of
the streets as determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission for safety
purposes. In those exception conditions where the Planning and Zoning
Commission determines no sidewalks are required, they may be excluded.

1115.19 EXTRA-SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The utilities, pavements, and other land improvements as required shall be
designed of extra-size and/or extensions provided as may be necessary to serve
nearby land which is an integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage
area in addition to the improvements required for development of the proposed
subdivision.
1115.20 OFF-SITE EXTENSIONS.
   If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of the proposed
subdivision, and if the Planning and Zoning Commission finds the extensions
across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a municipal expense until some future time, the
subdivider may be required, prior to approval of the final play, to obtain
necessary easements or rights of way and construct and pay for such extensions.
Such improvements shall be available for connections by subdividers of
adjoining land.

1117.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Prior to final approval of any plat, the following bonds, deposits and
insurance policies shall be provided by the subdivider:
1117.02 PERFORMANCE BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Purpose. A performance bond shall be posted by the subdivider to
guarantee to the Municipality that in the event the required public
improvements and utilities which were an integral part of the approved final
plan are not installed, the Municipality may install such required public
improvements and utilities at the expense of the subdivider.
   (b)   Bond Requirements. The required bond shall be so worked as to insure
the completion of the improvements, to the extent required by these Regulations
or which may be required by the Planning and Zoning Commission, including: the
construction of all roads and pavements; all sidewalks and curbs and the
installation of a storm drainage system; all sanitary sewage facilities; water
courses and bridges; the installation of trees, the grading of lots, the
seeding of lawns, provision for adequate rear yard drainage, the installation
of all curb cuts and driveways, and the setting of all monuments.
   The applicant shall within one year of the date of approval of the Final
Plat by the Commission, file with the Municipal Clerk a surety bond in favor of
Obetz. Such bond must be executed by a surety company authorized to enter into
such bonds under the laws of the State of Ohio. The bond shall be in such
amount and in such form and contain such conditions as the Commission may
require. The bond shall not be released by the Commission until the Municipal
Engineer and the Utilities Superintendent has determined that all of the bond
conditions have been fully satisfied and until the required Maintenance Bond
has been filed with the Municipality. No building permit shall be issued for
more than one single-family house on the approved subdivision until the bond is
accepted. No Certificate of Occupancy for said single-family house shall be
issued until said bond is accepted and the binder coat is laid on the
subdivision road.
   Should a subdivision be approved in sections, the above requirements may be
applied by section, rather then to the subdivision as a whole at the option of
the subdivider unless specifically required by the Commission. Requirements by
the Commission may include thoroughfare and infrastructure improvements that
are deemed appropriate for the large development and necessary for incremental
development of the section.
   (c)   Term of Performance Bond Extension. The term of a performance bond may
be extended by the Commission upon approval of a petition from the developer to
the Commission requesting an extension subject to agreement of such extension
by the surety company.
   (d)   Maintenance Bond. Prior to the release of a performance bond, the
subdivider shall present a maintenance bond equal to 20% of the value of the
public and private improvements required by the approved subdivision plans and
the subdivision regulations. The developer or designated representative shall
meet with Municipal officials during the eleventh (11th) month of the one-year
maintenance bond to perform a final inspection of the improvements. Any
deficiencies shall be documented in writing and provided to the developer who
shall take appropriate action in addressing said deficiencies.
   (e)   "As Built" Drawing and Release of Bond. Application for the release of
the performance bond, (insuring the proper installation of required
improvements), upon completion of all required improvements, must include "As
Built" drawings if any changes from the approved plans have been made. Two
copies of the above "As Built" shall be submitted to and approved by the
Utilities Superintendent and the Municipality Engineer, showing the location of
said improvements, as constructed, in both plan and profile. In addition, a
revised grading plan, denoting any change made in the direction of surface
water runoff which resulted from a change in the approved grading plan, shall
be submitted to and approved by the Commission prior to the release of the
bond. The "As Built" drawings and revised grading plan shall be signed by a
land surveyor licensed in the State of Ohio.
   (f)   Warrantee Deed. A Warrantee Deed, acceptable to the Municipal
Solicitor, conveying streets, drainage right-of-way easements, and reserved
strips for future streets, to Obetz must be filed with the Commission before
acceptance of streets is recommended to the Municipal Council. After acceptance
by the Municipal Council, the deed must be filed in the Municipal Clerk’s
Office by the developers.
   (g)   Bond Instructions
      (1)   The bond form obtainable from the Zoning Inspector is the only one
acceptable to the Commission.
      (2)   The bond must be for the total amount required by the Commission.
      (3)   Power of Attorney of person signing on behalf of the surety company
must be attached to the bond if not already on file with the Commission.
      (4)   If the person acting as attorney for the surety company is not a
licensed resident agent of the State of Ohio, then a licensed Ohio resident
agent of the company shall countersign this bond.
      (5)   The signatures of two witnesses are required on the bond.
      (6)   If the subdivision applicant is a corporation, then the corporate
seal must be shown in addition to the seal of the bonding company.
      (7)   The bond must show the bond number and the name of the bonding
company’s local agent.
      (8)   Obetz requires a completion date of five (5) years.
      (9)   The Commission will consider application for an extension of time
to complete improvements when good cause for delays is shown and the extension
is agreed to by the surety company.
      (10)   Performance bonds shall not be released until the “As Built”
drawings, as required in Section
1117.02(e), and all improvements have been approved by the Commission and the
road has been accepted by the Municipal Council. No road completed after
October 31 shall be accepted prior to April 1 of the succeeding year.
   (b)   Cash Bond. The Commission may, as its discretion, require the posting
by the developer of a cash bond in lieu of any or all of the provisions of this
Section. Interest on such bond shall accrue to the developer, but in no event
shall be payable thereto until performance has been completed in accordance
with all of the provisions of the Regulations. The Commission shall determine
the amount of such bond.
1117.03 INDEMNITY INSURANCE.
   A policy of indemnity insurance in the amount of $500,000/$1,000,000
personal liability and $1,000,000 property damage protecting the Municipality
against any claims for damage to person or property resulting from or by reason
of the construction of the above mentioned improvements shall be furnished to
the Municipality and maintained in force by the subdivider. The insurance
policy shall remain in full force and effect until all improvements are
completed and maintained to the satisfaction of the Council. 
1117.04 CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION PROCESS.
   (a)   Pre-construction Meeting Required. Prior to the construction of
improvements, a pre-construction meeting will be required between the developer
and/or designated representative(s) and the Municipal Engineer, Water and
Wastewater Superintendents, and the Zoning Inspector. The purpose of this
meeting is to review the construction schedule and related details, as well as
the inspection process.
   (b)   Construction Inspection Process. Following completion of improvements,
the Municipality’s designated construction inspector will review the project
and, if necessary, prepare a detailed list of items which are not in compliance
with Municipal standards. Municipal officials will review this detailed list
and determine which items, if any, must be addressed prior to the Municipality
accepting any building permit applications. All items on the detailed list must
be addressed prior to the Municipality accepting the improvements.

1131.01 AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   This Zoning Ordinance is adopted under the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapters
713.06- 713.15, as may be amended. This Ordinance shall be known as the “Zoning
Ordinance of the Village of Obetz, Ohio” and may be cited as such, as “this
Ordinance” or as “the Zoning Ordinance.”
1131.02 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion
of the public health, safety, and the general welfare. Whenever the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance are at variance with the requirements of
any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or Ordinances, the most
restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards shall govern.
1131.03 SEPARABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of the Zoning Ordinance be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the Zoning Ordinance as a whole, or any part thereof other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
1131.04 REPEAL AND EFFECTIVE DATE.
   All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with this Zoning Ordinance
or inconsistent with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent necessary to give this Zoning Ordinance full force and
effect. The Zoning Ordinance shall become effective from and after the date of
its approval and adoption, as provided by law.
1131.05 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error be discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word
or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and
such word or words supplied, omitted or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct word were contained in the text as originally published. No such
alteration shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the
nature or extent of such error.
1131.06 RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING ZONING CODE.
   This Zoning Code is adopted in whole and is a replacement of the Zoning Code
of Obetz of 1982, as amended, which was repealed by Council effective October
21, 2002.
1131.07 RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING.
   It is the intention of Council that this code shall implement the planning
policies adopted by Council for Obetz, as reflected in a comprehensive plan,
land use plan, and all other planning documents formally adopted by the
Council. While the Council reaffirms its commitment that this Code and any
amendment to it be in conformity with adopted planning policies, the Council
hereby expresses its intent that neither this Code nor any amendment to it may
be challenged on the basis of any alleged nonconformity with any planning
document.
1131.08 AMENDMENTS: EFFECTIVE DATE AND REFERENDUM.
   (a)   Amendments, as per Chapter
1181 , adopted by Council shall become effective thirty (30) days after the
date of such adoption. Such amendment fails to become effective if within
thirty (30) days after the passage of the ordinance there is presented to the
Clerk a petition, signed by a number of qualified voters residing in the
Municipality equal to but not less than ten (10) percent of the total vote cast
in such area at the last preceding general election at which a Governor was
elected, requesting Council to submit such ordinance to the electors of the
Municipality for approval or rejection at the next general election.
   (b)   No amendment for which such referendum vote has been requested shall
be put into effect unless a majority of the vote cast on the issue is in favor
of the amendment. Upon certification by the applicable County Board of
Elections that the amendment has been approved by the voters it shall take
immediate effect.
1131.09 RELATIONSHIP TO PUBLIC WORKS AND BUILDINGS.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be construed to prevent Obetz from
constructing, repairing or maintaining public works or public buildings in the
Municipality.
1131.10 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   The districts established in Chapters
1138  through
1163  of the Zoning Ordinance are shown on the Official Zoning Map which,
together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted as part of the
Zoning Ordinance. The district boundaries shown thereon are legally described
as follows:
   (a)   Identification of the Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map
shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the Municipal
Clerk, and bearing the seal of the Village of Obetz.
   (b)   Interpretation of District Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning districts as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the center lines of streets or highways, street lines, or highway right-of-way
lines, such center lines, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines shall be
construed to be such boundaries;
      (2)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;
      (3)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, or the
center lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall
be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as
indicated on the Official Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions
shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Official Zoning Map;
      (4)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such
boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of such
railroad line; and
      (5)   Where the boundary of a district follows a stream, lake, or other
body of water, such boundary line shall be deemed to be at the limit of the
jurisdiction of the Municipality, unless otherwise indicated.

1159.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)    Planned districts shall include residential, commercial, industrial,
and mixed use subdistricts: Planned Residential District (PRD), Planned
Commercial District (PCD), Planned Industrial District (PID), and Planned Unit
District (PUD).
   (b)    It is the intent of the Planned Districts to promote the progressive
development of land and construction thereon and to encourage imaginative
architectural design and layout, flexibility in building styles and types, and
sensitivity to the natural environment.
   (c)    The Planned Districts are designed to guide development in an
orderly, coordinated and comprehensive manner that preserves natural quality
and beauty and provides supporting community facilities in the development of
diverse, sound urban environments consistent with accepted land planning,
landscape architecture practices and engineering principles. Such developments
should:
      (1)    Provide a well-designed and connected open space and recreational
system that includes pedestrian and bicycle areas, play areas, and scenic
areas.
      (2)    Preserve and utilize natural topography and geologic features,
scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, while preventing disruption of
normal drainage patterns.
      (3)    Provide a more efficient pattern of development that reduces
investments in utility lines, streets, and similar infrastructure.
      (4)    Promotes a development pattern in harmony with the Municipal land
use objectives and priorities.
   (d)   In order to accomplish the above purposes, the intent of the Planned
Districts is to allow the applicant to lessen the development standards in some
areas in exchange for an increase in development standards in another.
   (e)   The process for achieving the above purpose and intent is to require
the submission and approval of a preliminary plan for the total proposed
development and the submission and approval of a final development plan for all
or any part of the area, defined in the preliminary plan, prior to obtaining a
zoning certificate as part of the approval for the construction of any portion
of the area. As part of the preliminary plan, the applicant must prepare and
submit a development standards text that identifies any development standards
that is less restrictive than the standards set forth in this chapter or other
chapters of the Codified Ordinances. As part of the development standards text,
the applicant must justify the modifications of these standards based on the
fact that the proposed development goes beyond minimum requirements in other
areas that will result in a superior development than if the standards set
forth in this chapter and the other chapters of the Codified Ordinances has
been followed. As part of the final development plan, the applicant must
reaffirm use of the previously approved development standards text or submit as
part of the final development plan a modified development standards text for
approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.

Plan and determine whether it complies with the regulations of this chapter.
Planning and Zoning Commission will forward a recommendation to Council.
      (4)    A Preliminary Plan shall be valid for five years after Council
approval. Construction of any phase of the development must begin within this
period or a new Preliminary Plan is required.
   (b)    Submission of Final Development Plan. 
      (1)    Prior to filing for Final Development Plan Approval, the applicant
shall meet with the Zoning Inspector, Administrator, Economic Development
Director and Municipal Engineer to review the Final Development Plan relative
to the previously approved Preliminary Plan and Development Standards Text as
well as procedures for approval.
      (2)    The applicant shall submit an application to the municipality
including the required number of copies of the proposed Development Plan,
Development Standards Text modification if appropriate and any other required
information in accordance with the submission schedule of the Planning and
Zoning Commission. In order to defray the cost of examination of the materials

of the Planning and Zoning Commission, minor modifications of the approved
Preliminary Development Plan may be made. Such modification shall not increase
the overall density of the site or change the essential character of the
approved plan. If the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that such
proposed changes significantly alter the approved preliminary development plan,
it is considered a major modification and a revised preliminary development
plan must be resubmitted to Council for approval. Development of land shall not
proceed prior to final approval of the revised Preliminary Development Plan.
Any development undertaken without such final approval is in violation of this
Zoning Code and an abatable nuisance.
   (e)    Variances from Development Standards. The Planning and Zoning
Commission and/or Council may approve variances from the Development Standards
of this Chapter as part of the Development Standards Text and Preliminary or

1159.07 OWNERSHIP OF COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   Different ownership and management options apply to the permanently
protected common open space created through the planned development process.
The common open space shall remain undivided and may be owned and managed by a
homeowners association, the Municipality, or a recognized land trust or
conservation district (conservancy). A public land dedication, not exceeding
ten (10) percent of the total parcel size, may be required by the Municipality
to facilitate trail or pathway connections. A narrative describing ownership,
use and maintenance responsibilities shall be submitted for all common and
public improvements, utilities, and open spaces.
   (a)    Ownership Standards. Common open space within planned developments
shall be owned, administered, and maintained by any of the following methods,
either individually or in combination, and subject to approval by the
Municipality.
      (1)    Offer of Dedication. The Municipality shall have the first offer
of dedication of undivided common open space in the event said land is to be
conveyed. Dedication shall take the form of a fee simple ownership. The
Municipality may, but not be required to accept undivided common open space
provided: 1) such land is accessible to all the residents of the Municipality;
2) there is no cost of acquisition other than incidental costs related to the
transfer of ownership; 3) the Municipality agrees to maintain such lands; 4)
the land is not potentially hazardous. Where the Municipality accepts
dedication of common open space that contains improvements, the Municipality
may require the posting of financial security to ensure structural integrity of
improvements for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months.
      (2)    Homeowners Association. The undivided common open space and
associated facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowners
association. The association shall be formed and operated under the following
provisions:
         A.    The developer shall provide a description of the association,
including its bylaws and methods for maintaining the common open space.
         B.    The association shall be organized by the developer and shall be

         D.    The association shall be responsible for maintenance of
insurance and taxes on the undivided common open space, enforceable by liens
placed by the Municipality on the association. The association may establish
rules to ensure proper maintenance of property, including monetary liens on the
homes and home sites of its members who fail to pay their association dues in a
timely manner. Such liens may impose a penalty of interest charges.
         E.    The members of the association shall share equitably the costs
of maintaining and developing, where appropriate, such undivided common open
space. Shares shall be defined within the association bylaws.
         F.    In the event of transfer, within the methods here permitted, of
undivided common open space land by the homeowners association, or the
assumption of maintenance of undivided common open space land by the
Municipality, notice of such pending action shall be given to all property
owners within the development.
         G.    The association shall provide for adequate staff to administer
common facilities and property and continually maintain the undivided common
open space.
         H.    The lease shall be subject to the approval of the homeowners
association board and any transfer or assignment of the lease shall be further
subject to the approval of the board. Lease agreements shall be recorded with
the Franklin County Recorders Office, whichever is applicable, and notification
shall be provided to Council within thirty (30) days of action by the board.
         I.    The homeowners association may lease common open space lands to
any other qualified person, or corporation, for operation and maintenance of
common open space lands, but such a lease agreement shall provide:
            1.   That the residents of the development shall at all times have
access to the common open space lands contained therein (except croplands
during the growing season);
            2.   That the undivided common open space shall be maintained for
purposes set forth in this chapter; and,
            3.   That the operation of common open space facilities may be for
the benefit of the residents only, or may be open to all residents of the
Municipality, at the election of the developer and/or homeowners association.
In cases where public trails or paths are provided as linkage between
developments or as a continuous link of common open space within the
Municipality, all residents of the Municipality shall have access to such
identified paths/walkways.
      (3)    Condominiums. The undivided common open space and associated
facilities may be controlled through the use of condominium agreements,
approved by the Municipality. Such agreements shall be in conformance with all
applicable laws and regulations. All undivided common open space land shall be
held as a "common element".
      (4)    Dedication of Easements. The Municipality may, but shall not be
required to, accept easements for public use of any portion or portions of
undivided common open space land, title of which is to remain in ownership by
condominium or homeowners association, provided:
         A.    Such land is accessible to Municipal residents;
         B.    There is no cost of acquisition other than incidental transfer
of ownership costs; and

bona fide conservation organization with perpetual existence;
         B.    The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for the proper
reverser or retransfer in the event that organization becomes unwilling or
unable to continue carrying out its function; and,
         C.    A maintenance agreement acceptable to Council is entered into by
the developer and the organization.
1159.08 MAINTENANCE OF OPEN SPACE.
   (a)    The ultimate owner of the open space shall be responsible for raising
all monies required for operations, maintenance, or physical improvements to
the open space through annual dues, special assessments, etc. The owner shall
be authorized under its bylaws to place liens on the property of residents who
fall delinquent in payment of such dues, assessments, etc.
   (b)    In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space shall at any time after establishment of the planned
development fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order and
condition in accordance with the Final Development Plan, the Zoning Inspector
may serve written notice upon such organization or upon the property owner(s)
and/or residents of the planned development setting forth the manner in which
the organization has failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable
condition. The notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of
maintenance be cured within thirty (30) days thereof, and shall state the date
and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within fourteen (14) days of
the notice. At such hearing Council may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the defeciencies and may give an extension of time within which they
shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be cured within said thirty (30) days or any
extension thereof, Council, in order to preserve the taxable values of the
properties within the planned development and to prevent the common open space
from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon said common open space and
maintain the same for a period of one (1) year. Said entry and maintenance
shall not vest in the public any rights to use the common open space. Before
the expiration of said year, Council shall, upon its initiative or upon the
request of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such organization, or
to the residents of the planned development, to be held by Council, at which
hearing such organization or the residents of the planned development shall
show cause why such maintenance by Council shall not, at the election of
Council, continue for a succeeding year. If Council determines such
organization is ready and able to maintain said common open space in reasonable
condition, Council shall cease to maintain said common open space at the end of
said year. If Council shall determine such organization is not ready and able
to maintain said common open space in a reasonable condition, Council may, in
its discretion, continue to maintain said common open space during the next
succeeding year and subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each
year thereafter. The decision of Council in any such case shall constitute a
final administrative decision subject to review as provided by law.
   (c)    The cost of such maintenance by the Municipality shall be assessed
against the properties within the planned development that have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a tax lien on said
properties. The Municipality, at the time of entering upon said common open
space for the purpose of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the
office of the Franklin County Recorder, upon the properties affected by such
lien within the planned development.

1161.01  PURPOSE.
   The overlays shall exist concurrently with the underlying zoning district
classifications and provide additional regulations related to use of the
property as well as design and development guidelines. In cases where the
requirements and standards of the Overlay District conflict with similar
requirements and standards of the underlying zoning district, the Overlay
District shall supersede such underlying zoning district.
    (a)    Obetz Junction Center. Obetz Junction Center is the central business
district of the Village of Obetz. This area is part of the original village
section of Obetz. The complexity of this mixed-use area cannot adequately be
addressed through traditional zoning techniques. Therefore special design and
development standards are necessary to create an identity for the area.
   (b)    Alum Creek Drive. Alum Creek Drive is a major arterial in the Village
of Obetz and the main commercial corridor. Design and development guidelines
are necessary in order to create an identity for the area and promote
architectural styles compatible with the municipal government center.
   (c)   Williams Road. Williams Road is the northern boundary of Obetz and the
main route to Fortress Obetz. Obetz' investment in property along Williams Road
presents a unique opportunity to create an area which includes businesses and
services that meet the needs of the patrons of Fortress Obetz as well as the
businesses and neighborhoods surrounding it. Williams Road is a two lane road
not capable of accommodating large volumes of tractor trailer traffic.
      (Ord. 17-17. Passed 6-26-17.)
1161.02 PERMITTED USES.
   The Permitted Uses of the underlying zoning districts apply to the Overlay
Districts unless otherwise prohibited in Section
1161.04. Additional permitted uses are as follows:
   (a)    Obetz Junction Center.
      (1)    Second and third story multi-family dwellings.
         (Ord. 17-17. Passed 6-26-17.)
   
1161.03  CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Conditional Uses of the underlying zoning districts apply to the Overlay
Districts unless otherwise prohibited in Section
1161.04. The Planning and Zoning Commission may impose requirements as needed
to preserve the intent of the overlay districts.
   (a)   Williams Road.
      (1)   Public or private recreation buildings, grounds, and accessory
buildings in conjunction with playgrounds and athletic fields.
      (2)   Public or private athletic training facilities, grounds, and

      (5)   Design criteria for corrective measures when necessary.
      (6)   Opinions and recommendations covering the stability of the site.
         (Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.06 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
       (a)   Responsibility. ESC Plan approval does not constitute assurance
that the proposed BMPs will perform in the manner indicated by the design. The
responsibility of the proper functioning operation and maintenance of the BMPs
remains with the owner. The owner shall be responsible for providing any
additional means or methods necessary to meet the intent of these regulations.
   It shall be the responsibility of the site owner to provide notification to
the Village 48-hours prior to commencement of initial site earth-disturbance.
In addition, the site owner shall provide notification to the Village, at least
48 hours prior to any work within or across a stream channel or a riparian
buffer conservation zone. Furthermore, within 45 days after site final
stabilization has been achieved, it shall be the responsibility of the site
owner to inform the Village Engineer that site activities are complete.
   (b)   Performance Liability. No provision of this standard shall limit,
increase or otherwise affect the liabilities of the developer nor impose any
liability upon the Village not otherwise imposed by law.
   (c)   Ownership and Maintenance. The person(s) or entity responsible for the
continued maintenance of temporary and permanent erosion control measures
shall, prior to any earth -disturbance, be identified to the satisfaction of
the Village. This party, both during and after site development, shall be
responsible for:
      (1)    Carrying out all provisions as approved on the erosion and
sediment control plan and required by this standard.
      (2)   Promptly removing all soil, miscellaneous debris and other
materials that may become spilled, dumped or otherwise deposited on any public
thoroughfares during transport to and from the development site, and taking
precautions to inhibit the deposition of sediment into any sewer system or
natural watercourse.
      (3)   In addition, the developer shall assume responsibility and all
costs for removing any sedimentation deposited in downstream drainage ways or
facilities deemed objectionable by the Village to the proper functioning of
these downstream areas.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance procedures
needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and shall
ensure the responsible party has adequate funding to conduct maintenance
activities as deemed necessary.
      (5)   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
shall be designed and constructed to minimize maintenance requirements. They
shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued performance of
their intended function. All sediment control practices shall be maintained in
a functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the Village Engineer.
      (6)   The applicant shall inform all contractors and subcontractors not
otherwise defined as "operators" as defined in the Ohio EPA's NPDES Permit, who
will be involved in the implementation of the ESCP of the terms and conditions
of the ESCP. The applicant shall maintain a written document containing the
signatures of all contractors and subcontractors involved in the implementation
of the ESCP as proof acknowledging that they have reviewed and understand the
conditions and responsibilities of the ESCP. The written document shall be
created and signatures shall be obtained prior to commencement of work on the
construction site. Any contractors or subcontractors hired after the original
signatures are obtained are also required to sign the document prior to
starting work on the site. A copy of the written document with signatures hall
be provided to the Village Engineer prior to commencing with the project and
after any new signatures are obtained.
 
      (d)   Inspection and Enforcement.
      (1)   General inspection requirements.
                     A.    The Village Engineer may inspect all site
development activities, including erosion and sediment control devices and
facilities while a development site, when subject to this regulation, is under
construction. When facilities are not constructed according to approved plans,
the Village Engineer has the explicit authority to compel compliance with the
approved plan and the objectives and standards of this regulation.
         B.   A copy of the approved erosion and sediment control plan shall be
maintained on site, or in a location easily accessible by the applicant and the
Village's inspector.
                   (2)    Enforcement procedures.
                    A.    Erosion and sediment control practices for
construction sites shall be inspected periodically by the Village to ensure
they are being properly maintained and, if not, the Village may compel the
owners to make the necessary repairs at the expense of the owner.
         B.   When practices require repair or maintenance: If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained with three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be
repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         C.   When practices fail to provide their intended function: If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the ESC plan and that another, more
appropriate control practice is required, the plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
         D.   When practices depicted on the ESC plan are not installed: If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented with ten
days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that
the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement
of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
               (3)    Applicant inspections required.
                     A.   At a minimum, all controls on the site shall be
inspected at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any
storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The owner
shall assign qualified inspection personnel (those with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls) to conduct these inspections to ensure that the control practices are
functional and to evaluate whether the ESC Plan is adequate and properly
implemented in accordance with the proposed permit schedule or whether
additional control measures are required. Internal inspections and
documentation of corrective actions taken must be made available upon request.
          B.   Disturbed areas used for storage of materials exposed to
precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential for
pollutants entering the drainage system.
         C.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the approved

erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         E.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
       (2) Final site inspection. Prior to the final site inspection by the
Village, the developer's engineer shall provide the site grading plan
documenting the intended site final grades.
         (Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.07  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither approval of a plan submitted under the provisions of these
regulations nor compliance with the provisions of these regulations shall
relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any person otherwise
imposed by law. The provisions of this regulation are promulgated to promote
the health, safety, and welfare of the public and are not designed for the
benefit of any individual or for the benefit of any particular parcel of
property.
(Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.08  COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS.
   All submittals are required to show proof of compliance with all state and
federal regulations. Approvals issued in accordance with this Chapter do not
relieve the applicant of responsibility for obtaining all other necessary
permits and/or approvals from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and other federal, state, and/or county agencies. If requirements vary, the
most restrictive requirement shall prevail. These permits may include, but are
not limited to, those listed below.    
   (a)    Ohio EPA NPDES permits authorizing storm water discharges associated
with construction activity or the most current version thereof. Proof of
compliance with these requirements shall be the applicant's Notice of Intent
(NOI) number from Ohio EPA, a copy of the Ohio EPA Director's Authorization
Letter for the NPDES Permit, or a letter from the site owner certifying and
explaining why the NPDES Permit is not applicable.
   (b)    Section 401 of the Clean Water Act: Proof of compliance shall be a
copy of the Ohio EPA Water Quality Certification application tracking number,
public notice, project approval, or a letter from the site owner certifying
that a qualified professional has surveyed the site and determined that Section

         (Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)    Prior to the start of grading and within seven days from the start of
grubbing the applicant must implement the erosion and sedimentation controls.
   (b)    Erosion and sedimentation controls shall meet these minimum
performance standards:
      (1)    During active construction:  
         A.   Non-structural preservation measures. The applicant must make use
of practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable as determined by the Village Engineer. Such practices may include
preserving riparian areas, preserving existing vegetation and vegetative buffer
strips, phasing of construction operations in order to minimize the amount of
disturbed land at any one time, and designation of tree preservation areas or
other protective clearing or grubbing practices.
         B.   Erosion control practices. The applicant must make use oferosion
controls that are capable of providing cover over seventy percent (70%) of
disturbed soils.
         C.   Runoff control practices. The applicant must make use of measures
that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
         D.   Sediment control practices. The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than 7 days. Such practices may include,
among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm    drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding or filtering runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth
diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control
practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
         E.   Non-sediment pollutant controls: No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials and concrete wash out water shall be discharged in
storm water runoff. The applicant must implement site best management practices
to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering
water resources or wetlands.
         F.   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      (2)   Maintenance. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired
as needed to ensure continued performance of their intended function until
final stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or
installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures
shall be followed:
         A.   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.   
         B.   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the ESCP and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the ESCP must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When practices depicted on the ESCP are not installed. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
      (3)   Final stabilization defined. The site reaches final stabilization
when all    soil disturbing activities are complete and a uniform perennial
vegetative    cover with a density of 70 percent coverage for the area has been
established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures.
In addition, all temporary erosion and sediment control practices have been
removed and disposed of in an acceptable manner.
   (c)   Post construction water quality practices.  
       (1)   Non-structural water quality practices: Non- structural post
construction best management practices include preservation, planning, or
procedures that direct development away from water resources or limit creation
of impervious surfaces. Practices such as conservation easements, riparian and
wetland setbacks, and conservation subdivision design are all non-structural
controls.
         A.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected from
disturbance throughout the construction phase of the project.
         B.   All non-structural water quality practices must be protected in
perpetuity through the use of appropriate legal tools. All easement or
conservation areas must appear on the final plat or other legal document.
      (2)   Structural water quality practices:  Structural post construction
best management practices are permanent features constructed to provide
treatment of storm water runoff either through storage, filtration, or
infiltration. All structural water quality practices must be established prior
to the completion of the project. Structural water quality practices should be
made functional once the disturbed areas on site are stabilized. If detention/
retention facilities were used for sediment control uring     development
sediments must be removed prior to the basin being used for post construction
storm water quality.
      (3)   Maintenance.  The post construction water quality practice must be
maintained in perpetuity by those parties identified in the ESCP or the Storm
Water Management Maintenance Agreement.
         (Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.10 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    All development areas are subject to external inspections by the
Village and/or designated representative to ensure compliance with the approved
ESCP.
   (b)    After each external inspection, the Village and or designated
representative shall prepare and distribute a status report to the applicant.
    
   (c)    If an external inspection determines that operations are being
conducted in violation of the approved ESCP, the Village may take action as
detailed in Section
1164.14.
(Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.11 BOND.
   If an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan is required by this Chapter,
then a performance and maintenance bond shall be posted according to Chapter
1117 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Obetz. The performance bond
shall be posted prior to the start of any construction process requiring an
ESP. No project will be released from Bond if there is failure to comply with
an approved ESCP. The bond will be released upon final site stabilization as
defined in Section
1164.09.   
(Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.12  APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any order, requirement, determination, or any other
action or inaction by the Village in relation to the regulations of Chapter
1164 may appeal to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The person seeking the
appeal shall give written notice of the appeal to the Planning and Zoning
Administrator. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall schedule a hearing
within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice. Following the hearing,
the Commission shall give written notification to the Appellant of its
determination within thirty (30) days of the hearing. Following receipt of the
Commission's determination, the Appellant may appeal the decision of the
Commission to the Village Council within five (5) days of receipt of the
notice. Appeals to Village Council shall be filed with the Council Clerk. All
appeals shall include the Appellant's name, address, phone number, and a
description of the order, requirement, determination, or other action or
inaction by the Village.
(Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)

or ordinance, the most restrictive provisions shall prevail.
   (b)    If any clause, section, or provision of this regulation is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)    These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property, and compliance with
the provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such a nuisance.
   (d)    Failure of the Village to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the site owner
from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and
shall not result in the Village, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 37-10. Passed 12-13-10.)
1164.14 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)    No person shall violate or cause or knowingly permit to be violated
any of the provisions of this regulation, or fail to comply with any of such
provisions or with any lawful requirements of any public authority made

the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line joining
points along said street lines fifty (50) feet from the point of the
intersection.
      (2)    In nonresidential zones at intersections of street rights of way,
a sight triangle shall be established as described by the right-of-way lines of
the intersection streets and the third side being a line passing through a
point on each right-of-way line that is a distance from their point of
intersection equal to the sum of the width of both rights of way divided by
four.
1165.04 ONE USE PER RECORDED LOT.
   In all residential districts (SR, R-l, R-2, R-3, and R-12) there shall not
be more than one (1) principal permitted use on each recorded lot.
1165.05 MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL USES PERMITTED.
   In all NC, GC, RI, LI, SO, and CF districts, multiple uses may be permitted
on a single lot of record subject to the following standards:
   (a)    Uses Shown on Approved Final Site Plan. Multiple uses may be
permitted on a single lot of record when such uses are shown on an approved
final site plan.
   (b)    Use Permit Issued. Multiple uses may be permitted on a single lot of
record when such uses are located in a multi-tenant structure and a use permit
is issued for the various uses.
1165.06  LAND DEDICATIONS AND IN-LIEU FEES.
   (a)    Mandatory Land Dedication. Acreage shall be set aside in all platted
residential subdivisions and multi-family residential developments, including
planned residential and planned unit development districts for the provision of
public areas. Such public areas shall be used as sites for public parks, open
space, and recreational areas. Such lands may be deeded to the Municipality and
thereby developed and managed by the Municipality or held, developed and
maintained by a private association, the bylaws and creation of which shall be
by approval of Council as an element of the subdivision platting process. Title
to dedicated land shall be transferred to the Municipality within sixty (60)
days of final plat approval. The amount of acreage to be set aside shall comply
with the following schedule:
 
ZONING DISTRICT PERCENT OF GROSS DEVELOPABLE ACRES
SR & R-1        15.0
R-2 & R-3       20.0
R-2             20.0
PRD & PUD       20.0
   (b)    Review And Approval Process. The mandatory land dedication
requirement shall serve as a component of the subdivision review process or
development review process if the development is except from the subdivision
review process. The Planning and Zoning Commission may review and reject the
proposed acreage if such site(s) is not appropriate for the intended use given
environmental, technical or land use considerations. In such circumstances, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall request an alternative site(s), which may

1167.01 PURPOSE. 
   The purpose and intent of this chapter is the preservation and promotion of
landscaping as a suitable and necessary aspect of land development, as a
component of Municipal development character, as an important beneficial
element of the microclimate through the provision of shade and as buffers, and
to promote the public health, safety and general welfare. It is further the
purpose of this Chapter to promote the preservation and, when necessary,
replacement of major trees removed in the course of land development, to
promote the proper utilization of landscaping as a buffer between certain land
uses to minimize conflicts, and to protect, preserve and promote the character
of the Municipality. (Ord. 42-16. Passed 6-13-16.)
1167.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Caliper - Caliper refers to the trunk diameter of a nursery stock or
younger tree. The measurement is taken 12 inches above the ground.
 
   (b)   Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) - Tree dbh is a standard method for
measuring the trunk of a standing tree. When measuring dbh, measure
approximately 4.5' from the ground up along the trunk. If the tree's branches
or bumps interfere with the dbh measurement, take the measurement below the
branch or bump. If a diameter tape is not available, measure tree circumference
by wrapping a normal tape measure around the tree at 4.5' from the ground, then
divide the resulting circumference in inches by 3.14 to determine dbh.
(Ord. 42-16. Passed 6-13-16.)
1167.03 PRESERVATION OF TREES AND WOODED AREAS.  
   (a)    Tree Preservation. All trees with a dbh of six (6) inches or more
shall be maintained and preserved as part of all existing or proposed non-
residential development unless the removal of the trees is approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. In new development or redevelopment, the
location of all driveways, off-street parking and loading areas, and all other
improvements, including grading, shall be designed to avoid the destruction of
any such existing tree defined herein. Trees may be removed without tree
replacement requirements under the following conditions:
      (1)    An existing tree will be located within a public right-of-way or
easement.
      (2)    An existing tree is located within the area to be covered by a
proposed structure or within twelve (12) feet from the perimeter of such
structure(s) and such structure(s) cannot be located in a manner to avoid
removal of an existing tree at the same time permitting desirable, logical and
appropriate development of the lot.
      (3)    An existing tree will be located within a proposed driveway, off-
street parking area or other improvement and relocation of such improvement
would not permit desirable, logical, and appropriate development of the lot.
      (4)    An existing tree is damaged or diseased.
      (5)   The tree is an undesirable species.
   (b)   Tree Replacement. The replacement of trees shall be as follows:
      (1)   Trees with a dbh between 6 inches and 12 inches shall be replaced
on a one (1) inch for one (1) replacement basis.
      (2)   Trees with a dbh greater than 12 inches but less than 24 inches
shall be replaced on a two (2) inch for one (1) replacement basis.
      (3)   Trees with a dbh of 24 inches or greater shall be replaced on a
three (3) inch for one (1) inch replacement basis.
      (4)   The type of replacement tree must be approved by the Zoning
Inspector prior to planting. The total number of tree replacement inches is a
separate requirement from other planting requirements, including but not
limited to, perimeter, interior, street trees, and additional site plantings.
      (5)    Payment in Lieu of Tree Replacement. The Planning and Zoning
Commission can authorize payment in lieu of tree replacement if the replacement
of trees on the site would interfere with the development or make the site
overcrowded. Payment will be placed in a dedicated Tree Fund, such funds being
used to pay for new trees in other areas of the Village of Obetz. The
replacement value of the trees will be calculated on a caliper basis and will
be included on the fee schedule adopted by Council.
      (6)   Tree Removal Permit Required. In all non-single family residential
zoning districts, a Tree Removal Permit must be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator prior to the removal of any tree with a dbh of 6" or greater. A
Tree Removal Permit shall be required when developing all new residential
subdivisions.
   (c)   Significant Trees. All significant trees, as determined by the Village
of Obetz, shall be protected and preserved to ensure that the value provided to
Obetz and its citizens by the cultural, historical, biological, or
horticultural significance of any tree, is continued into the future.
   (d)   Wooded Areas. Streets, lots, structures and parking areas shall be
laid out to avoid the unnecessary destruction of heavily wooded areas. If
heavily wooded areas are destroyed, trees shall be replaced pursuant to the
Tree Replacement Provisions included in this Chapter.
(Ord. 42-16. Passed 6-13-16.)

remove the normal canopy or disfigure the tree. With an immature tree, removing
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the canopy will be considered topping.
   (c)    Height of Limbs Over Sidewalks and Streets. Every owner of any tree
overhanging any street or public right of way within the Village shall prune
the branches so that such branches shall not obstruct light from any street
lamp or obstruct the view of any street intersection. There shall be a clear
space of eight (8) feet above the sidewalk and fourteen (14) feet above the
street.

guidelines as recommended by the National Arborists Association for line
clearance work.
   (e)    Public Tree Care.

municipality, shall attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising poster,
decoration, decorative lighting, or other contrivance to any tree on
Municipally owned property. No person shall permit any fire to burn where such
fire or heat therefrom, or heat from any source will injure any portion of any

1171.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate accessory uses and structures
in order to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by permitting such
structures and uses to be established in a manner that makes them compatible
with the principal use of the property at issue and harmonious with all uses
upon adjacent properties.
(Ord. 37-13. Passed 8-12-13.)
1171.02 DEFINITION.
   "Accessory Structure or Use" means a structure or use that: (1) is
subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to the principal use; (2) contributes
to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of the principal use; and (3) is
located on the same lot and in the same zoning district as the principal use.
Examples of accessory structures include, but are not limited to, detached
garages, carports, sheds, greenhouses, decks, patios, gazebos, swimming pools

1173.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this section is to establish regulations controlling the
location, installation and standards for fences in order that a property owner
may construct a fence which retains the privilege of privacy, allows attractive
landscape design, or offers reasonable security while assuring that such fences
are located and constructed to respect the rights and enjoyment of neighboring
property owner, the appearance of the community, and the overall health,
safety, and public welfare of its residents.
   This section sets forth regulations pertaining to the location, installation
and standards for new fences in all zoning districts in the Municipality. Any
fence erected prior to the date of this section, which does not comply with
these regulations, shall be nonconforming. However, the Zoning Inspector may
order appropriate remedial measures to alleviate any hazardous conditions
related to any fence, whether newly constructed following adoption of this
section, or constructed prior to the adoption of this section, whether
conforming or nonconforming, when the Zoning Inspector determines that such
condition, without immediate remedial measures jeopardizes the health and
safety of nearby residents or occupants. (Ord. 33-03. Passed 5-5-03.)

1175.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide standards for signs to safeguard
life, health, property, safety, and public welfare, while encouraging
creativity, variety and compatibility, and enhancement of the Municipality’s
image. Signs shall be regulated relative to time, place, and manner. The
individual user’s right to convey a message must be balanced with the public’s
right to be free of signs which unreasonably distract drivers and pedestrians.
This Chapter is based on the premise that signs are subject to control as much
as noise, odor, debris, and other similar characteristics of land use, and that
if not regulated, can become a nuisance to adjacent properties or the community
in general, or depreciate the value of other properties within the community.
The provisions of this Chapter are intended to:
   (a)   Encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute in a
positive way to the Municipality’s visual environment, express local character,
and help develop a distinctive image for the Municipality;
   (b)   Encourage signs that are responsive to the aesthetics and character of
their particular location, adjacent buildings and uses, and the surrounding
neighborhood. Signs should be compatible and integrated with the building's
architectural design and with other signs on the property;
   (c)   Prevent or limit traffic or pedestrian accidents, injuries, deaths,
and property damages resulting from obstructed vision, distraction, or
confusion to the public due to the undue proliferation of signs;
   (d)   Encourage a healthful economic and business environment in the
community;
   (e)   Limit the height and size of signs to those that are appropriate in
scale to the community; and,
   (f)   Provide adequate way finding signage for motorists and pedestrians.
   (g)   Reduce visual clutter.
   (h)   Minimize the risk of damage and injuries from signs that are
structurally unsafe.
   (i)   Prevent blight characterized by oversized, overcrowded, abandoned,
obsolete, and/or dilapidated signs.
   (j)   Protect the public’s right to receive information protected by the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
      (Ord. 24-08. Passed 6-9-08.)
1175.02  APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   Generally. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, all signs
placed, erected, installed, painted, modified or altered in Obetz shall conform
to the standards set forth in this Chapter and shall require permits in
accordance with Section
1175.09 of this Chapter. Erection, modification, alteration, placement,
replacement or other action involving a sign that is in any way inconsistent
with this Chapter
1175 shall be a violation of the Zoning Code and subject to penalties and
remedies set forth in Chapter
1183 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Sign Standards. The sign standards provided in this Chapter are
intended to apply to signs in each zoning district in the Municipality. Only
signs authorized by this Chapter shall be allowed.
   (c)   Existing Signs; Continuance. Except as otherwise specifically
provided, nothing in this Chapter shall require removal or discontinuance of an
existing on-premises or existing off- premises sign. No existing signs shall be
enlarged or extended without a Sign Permit. Such nonconforming signs shall not
be enlarged or extended and these signs shall be deemed a nonconforming sign
under the terms of the Zoning Code.
   (d)   Nonconforming Signs.  
      (1)   Any legal nonconforming sign, as defined in Section
1175.03, may be continued in use if maintained in accordance with this sub-
section. Temporary signs shall not be considered legal, non-conforming signs.
      (2)   All pre-existing illegal nonconforming signs must be removed in
accordance with this sub-section. The Zoning Inspector shall issue an order for
the sign to be removed within fifteen (15) days. The cost of removal will be
assessed to the property owner. If the property owner refuses to pay for
removal of the sign, the cost of such removal shall be assessed to the property
owner’s tax records.
      (3)   Any nonconforming sign displayed on the premises shall be removed
or brought into conformance with the provision of this Chapter before a permit
for a new sign may be issued.
      (4)   A legal nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal
nonconforming designation and shall be immediately brought into compliance with
this Chapter and a new permit is required, or shall be removed upon any of the
following occurrences:
         A.   The nonconforming sign is structurally altered, enlarged,
relocated, or replaced.
         B.   The nonconforming sign is determined by the Zoning Inspector or
the Chief Building Official to be in a dangerous or defective condition; to
fail to conform to health and fire codes; a public nuisance; or abandoned,
deteriorated; or in need of repair or replacement.
         C.   The nonconforming sign face and/or supportive structure is
destroyed or damaged in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the combined
replacement value of the sign and supportive structure, by any cause.
         D.   Upon the discontinuance of the present use of property for which
the sign was intended for a period of more than six (6) months.
      (5)   A nonconforming sign shall not be moved in whole or in part to any
other location unless such sign is made to conform to this Chapter. If an owner
is forced to move a nonconforming sign by Municipal, state, or federal
officials for any reason other than enforcement, such sign shall maintain its
nonconforming status, but must still adhere to the setback requirements.
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the ordinary repair,
maintenance, and non-structural alteration of nonconforming signs. Maintaining
the nonconforming sign to the exact legal nonconforming design shall be
allowed; however, any proposed changes to a nonconforming sign, except for
refacing an existing sign, shall require that the sign be made to conform to
the requirements of this Chapter. Refacing an existing nonconforming sign shall
not be considered an alteration as long as the refacing constitutes an exact
replica of the existing sign face. The design, color scheme, translucency,
graphics and text must exactly match those existing. No structural alterations
shall be made in, to, or upon such nonconforming sign, except those required by
law to make the sign conform to the requirements of this Chapter.
      (7)   Nonconforming signs are also subject to the provisions of Chapter
1179 in addition to this Chapter. (Ord. 24-08. Passed 6-9-08.)

faith such as ordering materials or signing a contract with a licensed
contractor, the Zoning Inspector shall grant an extension of thirty days for
completion of the work. If an appeal is filed in accordance with Section
1175.15, the time for performance shall be delayed until resolution of the
appeal. If the Zoning Inspector finds that the lack of repair constitutes a

1179.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance or amendments that
may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures,
and characteristics of use which were lawful before this Zoning Ordinance was
passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent
of this Zoning Ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they
are removed, but not to encourage additional non-conformities.
1179.02  PARTLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDINGS.
   To avoid undue hardships, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed
to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently.
1179.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (a)    The construction of a conforming structure and/or the conduct of a
permitted use shall be allowed on any lot of record which has an area and/or
lot width less than that required for such structure or permitted use in the
zoning district in which the lot is located. Variance of any development
standard other than minimum lot area and/or minimum lot width shall be obtained
only through action of the Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance with
Chapter
1181.
   (b)    Such nonconforming lots must be in separate ownership and not of
continuous frontage with other land in the same ownership on the effective date
of this Zoning Code. Otherwise, development shall be permitted only in
accordance with development standards of the zoning district in which such
ownership is located.
1179.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND DEVELOPMENTS.
   Structures and/or accessory development, which by reason of size, type,
location on the lot, or otherwise in conflict with regulations of the zoning
district in which they are located may be altered, reconstructed or extended on
appeal to the Planning and Zoning Commission, provided the applicant shows
that:
   (a)    The nonconforming structure and development was lawful at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Such alteration, reconstruction or extension is necessary and
incidental to such existing lawful nonconforming use as demonstrated by the
applicant.
   (c)    Such extension shall not increase the total floor area by more than
fifty (50) percent.
   (d)    No extension shall be requested within two (2) years of the last
previous extension as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
1179.05  NONCONFORMING USES.
   The lawful nonconforming use of a lot and/or structure may be continued,
expanded, substituted, changed, or re-established subject to the following:
   (a)    Continuation. The lawful use of any dwelling, building, or structure,
and of any land or premises, as existing at the time of enactment of this
Zoning Code, may be continued. However, if any such nonconforming use is
voluntarily discontinued for a period of six (6) months or more, any future use
of such land shall be in conformity with this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Expansion. A lawful nonconforming use may be expanded within an
existing structure manifestly arranged or developed for such use on appeal to
the Planning and Zoning Commission, provided the applicant shows that:
      (1)    The nonconforming use was lawful at the time of enactment of this
Zoning Code.
      (2)    Such expansion is necessary and incidental to such existing lawful
nonconforming use as demonstrated by the applicant.
      (3)    No expansion shall be requested within two (2) years of the last
previous expansion as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (c)    Substitution. On approval of an appeal to the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the substitution of a lawful nonconforming use existing at the time
of enactment of this Zoning Code by another lawful nonconforming use may be
permitted if no structural alterations, except those required by law or
resolution are made, provided that any use so substituted shall be of the same
or a more restricted classification, subject to approval of an appeal to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, provided the applicant shows that:
      (1)    The nonconforming use was lawful at the time of enactment of this
Zoning Code.
      (2)    Such substitution is compatible with adjacent land use, adjacent
zoning, an to appropriate plans for the area.
      (3)    No substitution shall be requested within two (2) years of the
last previous expansion as approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (d)    Re-establishment. A lawful nonconforming use of any structure damaged
by fire, explosion, flood, riot, or act of God may be continued and used as
before any such calamity, provided the building or structure has not been
destroyed to an extent of more than one-half (½) of its fair value, and
provided such reconstruction is started within twelve (12) months of such
calamity and is continued in a reasonable manner until completed.

1181.04 PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIANCES.
   (a)    Planning and Zoning Commission Consideration. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the
terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use
of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district and no
permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance.
   (b)    Requirements for Variance. A variance from the terms of the Zoning
Ordinance shall not be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless and
until a written application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning Inspector
and the Planning Commission containing:

to the following considerations shall be examined in the review, public
hearing, and approval of an application for a variance:
      (1)    That special circumstances or conditions exist which are not
applicable to other lands or structures in the same zoning district.
      (2)    That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties
in the same zoning district under the provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (3)    That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
      (4)    That the granting of the variance will not confer on the applicant
any undue privilege that is denied by this Zoning Code to other lands or
structures in the same zoning district.
      (5)    That the granting of the variance will in no other manner
adversely affect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity,
and general welfare.
      (6)    That the granting of the variance is not solely based upon the
showing that the property could be put to better economic use than presently
permitted by zoning regulations.

otherwise not permitted within the respective zoning district.
   (d)    Review Procedure.

Zoning Code and punishable as prescribed herein. The Commission's determination
in taking action on a requested variance shall be accompanied by findings of
fact and a statement of the reasons for the decision reached.
   (e)    Issuance of Zoning Certificate. Upon approval of the Planning and
Zoning Commission or upon appeal and approval by Council, and with such
conditions attached by either body as may be necessary to secure the objectives
of this Zoning Code, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance for all approved variances to the applicant within ten (10) days of
approval. The requirements relative to expiration of Section
1183.05 shall apply.

      (1)    Filing of Application. Fifteen (15) copies of a completed
application shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector at least thirty five days
(35) days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Prior to accepting such application, the Zoning Inspector shall
review the submittal and determine whether such application is complete and
meets all submittal requirements. Failure to submit a complete application, as
determined by the Zoning Inspector, shall result in a refusal of acceptance.
      (2)    Public Hearing. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear the
application at its next regularly scheduled meeting provided the applicant
meets the requirements of subsection (c)(1) hereof. Nothing in this section
shall prevent the Commission from granting a continuance of the public hearing.
      (3)    Public Notice for Hearing. At least one (1) notice shall be given
at least ten (10) days prior to a scheduled public hearing in one (1) or more
newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality. Such notice shall
include the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed
variance(s).
      (4)    Notice to Property Owners. Written notice of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Municipality, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of a
scheduled public hearing to all property owners as listed under Section
1181.05(a)(4). The notice shall correspond to subsection (c)(3) hereof in

render one of the following decisions:
         A.   Approval of conditional use as requested.
         B.   Approval of conditional use with modifications.
         C.   Disapproval of conditional use.
   (d)   The Commission shall apply criteria in subsection (b) hereof in
reaching its determination. In approving a conditional use, the Commission may
prescribe additional conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning
Code. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the conditional use is approved, shall be deemed a violation
of this Zoning Code and punishable as prescribed in Chapter
1183 and shall result in revocation of the conditional use approval and
respective Certificate of Zoning Compliance. The Commission's determination in
taking action on a requested conditional use shall be accompanied by findings
of fact and a statement of the reasons for the decision reached.
   (e)    Issuance of Permit; Expiration. Upon approval of the Planning and
Zoning Commission or upon appeal and approval by Council, and with such
conditions attached by either body as may be necessary to secure the objectives
of this Zoning Code, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a conditional use permit
to the applicant within ten (10) days. Such permit shall authorize one
particular conditional use and such permit shall automatically expire if, for
any reason, the conditional use shall not be commenced within two (2) years,
including any construction or renovation. Such permit shall expire if a
conditional use is discontinued for more than six (6) months. The conditional
use permit serves as a contract between the municipality and the property
owner. The property owner must follow the conditions outlined in the permit and
will be required to sign an affidavit stating such at the time that the
conditional use permit is granted. If the property is sold, the new owner will
be required to sign such affidavit within thirty (30) days of taking ownership.
At that time, additional conditions may be attached to the conditional use
permit by the Zoning Inspector. If the property owner does not sign such
affidavit within thirty (30) days of taking ownership, the new owner must
reapply for a conditional use permit.
   (f)    Appeals. Whoever is aggrieved or affected by the decision of the
Commission involving an application for conditional use shall have the right to
file an appeal with Council. The appeal shall be filed in writing with the
Clerk no later than ten (10) days after the decision of the Commission. Council
shall have a maximum of sixty (60) days from receipt of an appeal for public
hearing, consideration, and a decision on the appeal. In reaching a
determination on a requested conditional use on appeal by Council, the
applicable portions of subsection (b) hereof shall apply.

1185.06  NEIGHBORHOOD IDENTITY FEATURES.
   The purpose of this section is to provide an organizational framework or
structure for the layout of new residential subdivisions. On a neighborhood-
wide scale, residents will have easy access to at least one central
neighborhood identity feature or gathering place (i.e. neighborhood park or
recreation center). Such neighborhood identity features lend a "sense of place"
to a new subdivision, thereby encouraging people to connect with their physical
surroundings and interact with their neighbors. A neighborhood identity feature
shall be provided within all eligible single- family, two-family, multifamily
and mixed use residential developments as shown in Section
1185.05(a). Identity features may include a school (as approved by the
appropriate school district), pocket park, trail system, pedestrian plaza or
courtyard, community (clubhouse) building or garden, artwork such as a
sculpture, water feature, fountain, picnic/barbeque area, or playground. When
parks, trails, pedestrian plazas or courtyards, gardens, or picnic/barbeque
areas are provided, the acreage that constitutes these features may count
toward meeting fifty percent (50%) of the open space/parkland dedication
requirements of the zoning code/subdivision regulations. Signage, fencing, and/
or other aspects of a required perimeter treatment shall not be counted as an
identity feature. In no event shall an identity feature credit be given for the
area associated with features such as landscaping or perimeter treatment,
entrance features, retention and detention area, or other items that are
required by other provisions of the zoning and subdivision code unless
specifically stated herein. A mechanism shall be defined and established by the
developer to ensure approval and perpetual maintenance of all neighborhood
identity features, per the development agreement.
   (a)    Neighborhood Identity Feature Table: Where the number of acres and
the number of dwelling units proposed in a development results in two different
numbers of required identity features, the larger number of required identity
features shall be used.
 
Size of Residential Development (Residential Number of Required Features
Acreage, Dwelling Units)
Under 5 acres or up to 20 dwelling units     None
5 -10 acres or 21 - 50 dwelling units        One
11 - 50 acres or 51 -150 dwelling units      Two
51 - 100 acres of 151 - 300 dwelling units   Three
Over 100 acres or over 301 dwelling units    Four
 
   (b)   Credit shall be given for identity features as follows:
      (1)    A system of trails throughout the entire development shall count
as one (1) identity feature. Trails should be designed to provide interesting
and distinct areas for walking, bicycling and/or riding in areas separate from
and in addition to traditional sidewalks. Trails shall be designed and
constructed using one of the following designs appropriate for the location as
determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and Parks & Recreation
Director or designee:
         A.   Ten (10) foot wide concrete or asphalt shared use trail;
         B.    Five (5) foot wide concrete or brick trail;
         C.    Five (5) foot wide crushed fines trail with collared edges -
this trail is intended for the preservation of wetland and natural riparian
areas; or
         D.    Five (5) foot wide decking or boardwalk trail.
      (2)    A pocket park, two (2) to five (5) acres in size shall count as
one (1) identity feature. A park of 10 acres shall count as two (2) identity
features. One neighborhood identity credit will be given for each five acre
increment of contiguous parkland set aside. All parkland must be deeded to the
Village.
      (3)    A water feature, fountain, or artwork such as a sculpture, shall
count as one-half (½) identity feature.
      (4)    Play grounds with commercial grade equipment, picnic/barbeque
areas with commercial grade equipment, or court games (tennis, volleyball or
basketball) at least one-thousand (1,000) square feet in size shall each count
as one (1) identity feature. Such features shall be reviewed and approved by
the Parks and Recreation Director.
      (5)    Plazas, courtyards, or community gardens with collars to define
garden hedges, which cover at least one thousand (1,000) square feet in size
shall each count as one (1) identity feature.
      (6)    A community (clubhouse) building at least two thousand (2,000)
square feet in size shall count as two (2) identity features.
      (7)    An in-the-ground swimming pool site at least (2,000) square feet
in size shall count as two (2) identity features. If these facilities are
utilized, they shall be maintained by the property owner/developer or
homeowner's association.
      (8)    Other features may be considered credit toward meeting the
identity feature requirement, subject to approval by the Planning and Zoning
Administrator or designee. (Ord. 38-04. Passed 10-11-04.)

   (a)    Design Standards for Garages for Two-family and Multifamily
Residential:
      (1)    Garages for attached townhouse and multifamily dwellings shall be
designed and oriented so that they do not dominate the front facade of the
building to which they are attached and so that they provide variety in the
front plane or facade of the building and visual interest on all sides of the
garage that are visible from the public right-of-way. Detached garages for
townhouse and multi-family dwellings shall be designed to be compatible with
the related residential structures and shall be designed and oriented to
minimize the visual effect of the scale and massing of the garages and create
visual interest on all sides of the garage that are visible from the public
right-of-way, through the use of landscaping, berming, architectural features
or styles, building materials, and/or orientation of the site.
      (2)    To the maximum extent feasible, garage entries, carports, and
parking garages shall not be located between a principal multi-family building
and a required street frontage, but shall instead be internalized in building
groups so that they are not visible from adjacent public streets.
      (3)    Detached garages and carports shall be compatible with the
principal building architecture, and shall incorporate similar and compatible
forms, scale, materials, colors, and details.
      (4)    Detached garages and carports shall have pitched roofs with a
minimum slope of 4:12. (Ord. 65-03. Passed 9-2-03.)

state that all dwellings covered by the approval shall be constructed as shown
in the application documents, except as such designs may have been amended by
conditions attached to the approval.
   (n)    Extension of Approval Periods.
      (1)    Once a Building Permit Review has been completed and approved it
becomes a part of the Building Permit and is subject to the same conditions of
the Building Permit. The Building Permit and the approval may be extended for
six (6) months with the approval of the Building Department and the Planning
Department if at least thirty percent (30%) of the overall building permits
have been issued in the subdivision for which the extension is being requested.
Only one such extension shall be granted.
      (2)    If the Building Permit Review has been approved for a phased
project, the approval will be void if no building permit is applied for within
a three year period. If one phase is completed which accounts for at least
thirty percent (30%) of the total project, the Building Permit Review approval
for the remaining phases shall be valid for an additional three (3) years from
the date of completion of the first phase. The issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy for the last building constructed in a phase shall mark the
completion of that phase. Only one such extension shall be granted for
multiphase projects.
   (o)    Appeal. Disputes regarding the Village's decisions shall be first
appealed to the Planning and Zoning Administrator, or designee. Disputes
regarding the Administrator's decisions shall be appealed to the Planning

this subsection may be amended by filing a new application for Building Permit
Review together with all supporting documents.
   (q)    Lapse of Approval. The right to construct residential structures in
accordance with the Building Permit Review approval shall lapse and be of no
further effect with respect to any homes for which a building permit has not
been obtained within six (6) months of the date of Review approval, unless an
extension has been granted.
   (r)    Building Permits. No building permit relating to any non-exempt
residential development shall be issued until the applicant has received a
Building Permit Review approval pursuant to the terms of this chapter.
(Ord. 65-03. Passed 9-2-03.)
1185.14 VARIANCES.
   If specific site conditions make it impossible or clearly impractical to
construct dwellings as required by these Residential Design Standards, the
applicant may request a variance from the terms of these Residential Design
Standards through the Village's standard zoning variance procedure set forth in
Section
1181.04, as amended. The variance process may not be used to vary the terms of
a subdivision approval or a Building Permit Review approval where the site
conditions supporting the variance were caused by the applicant or known to the
applicant at the time of the subdivision or Design Review application.
(Ord. 65-03. Passed 9-2-03.)
1185.15 ENFORCEMENT.
   Any violation of these Residential Design Standards, including without
limitation, construction of any new single-family detached, duplex dwelling
unit, or multifamily building without first obtaining subdivision or Design
Review approval, or filing false or misleading information on a subdivision or
Design Review application, shall be a violation of the Obetz Zoning
Regulations, as amended, and shall be subject to all the enforcement provisions
of those regulations. Without limiting the generality of the previous sentence,
these Residential Design Standards may be enforced by withholding residential
building permits, suspending or revoking building permits previously granted,
or issuing stop work orders effective until violations of these Standards have
been corrected.
(Ord. 65-03. Passed 9-2-03.)
1185.16 VIOLATION, PENALTY.
   Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a
violation of this chapter and shall be punished as provided in Chapter
1183.

application is still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Economic Development Director pursuant to Section
1193.13. The Economic Development Director shall grant an application for
renewal of a provisional license unless he/she determines that new grounds
exist for denial of a license application pursuant to Section
1193.08 or Section
1193.10, which did not exist at the time of the original license application.
In the event that an application for renewal of a provisional license is denied
and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the Village has the
right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial appeal of the
previous license denial.
1193.17 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   (a)    A sexually oriented business license is not transferable from one
licensee to another, from one location to another. Any purported transfer of a
sexually oriented business license shall automatically and immediately revoke
that license.
   (b)    A sexually oriented business employee license is not transferable
from one licensee to another, but the use of the license by the individual to
whom it was issued may be transferred from one licensed sexually oriented
business to another such licensed establishment during the term of the license,
provided that the licensee gives written notice of such transfer to the
Economic Development Director or his designee within fifteen (15) days of such
transfer.
1193.18  PROHIBITION OF ADULT MOTELS.
   (a)    No person shall operate an adult motel within the Village.
   (b)    Evidence that a sleeping room in a hotel, motel, or similar
commercial establishment has been rented and vacated two or more times in less
than ten (10) hour creates a rebuttable presumption that the establishment is
an adult motel as that term is defined in Section
1193.02.
   (c)   Evidence that a person in control of a sleeping room in a hotel,
motel, or similar commercial establishment has rented or sub-rented a sleeping
room to a person and, within ten (10) hours from the time the room was rented,
has rented or sub-rented the same sleeping room again, creates rebuttable
presumption that the establishment is an adult motel as that term is defined in
Section
1193.02.
   (d)    For purposes of subsection (b) hereof, the terms "rent" or "sub-rent"
mean the act of permitting a room to be occupied for any form of consideration.
   (e)    Any person who operates a hotel, motel, or similar commercial
establishment that is found to be an adult motel, as defined in Section
1193.02, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree.
1193.19 REGULATION OF EXHIBITION OF SEXUALLY EXPLICIT FILMS,  VIDEOS OR LIVE

"specified anatomical areas", without complying with the following
requirements:
      (1)    The sexually oriented business license application required under
this chapter shall be accompanied by a diagram of the premises showing a plan
thereof which specifies the location of one or more employee's stations and the
location of all overhead lighting fixtures, and which designates any portion of
the premises in which patrons will not be permitted. The diagram shall also
designate the place at which the sexually oriented business license will be
conspicuously posted, if granted. A professionally prepared diagram in the
nature of an engineer's or architect's blueprint shall not be required;
however, each diagram should be oriented to the north or to some designated
street or object and should be drawn to a designated scale or with marked
dimensions sufficient to show the various internal dimensions of all areas of
the interior of the premises to an accuracy of plus or minus six (6) inches.
      (2)   The interior of the premises shall be configured in such a manner
that there is an unobstructed view from an employee's station of every area of
the premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose, including
the interior of all viewing booths and excluding restrooms. Restrooms may not
contain video reproduction equipment, and no entertainment of any kind may be
offered in restrooms. If the premises has two or more employee's stations
designated, then the interior of the premises shall be configured in such a
manner that there is an unobstructed view of each area of the premises to which
any patron is permitted access for any purpose from at least one of the
employee's stations. The view required in this subsection must be by direct
line of sight from the employee's station.
      (3)    No alteration in the configuration or location of an employee's
station shall be made without the prior approval of the Economic Development
Director or his designee.
      (4)    At least one employee shall be on duty and situated in each
employee's station at all times that any patron is present inside the premises.
      (5)    An employee's station shall not exceed thirty-two (32) square feet
of floor area, and no single dimension of an employee's station shall exceed
eight (8) feet.
      (6)    The view from the employee's station(s) shall remain unobstructed
by any doors, curtains, partitions, walls, merchandise, display racks or other
materials.
      (7)    No patron may at any time be permitted access to any area of the
premises which has been designated in the license application filed pursuant to
this chapter as an area in which patrons will not be permitted.
      (8)    No viewing booth may be occupied by more than one person at any
time.
      (9)    The premises shall be equipped with overhead lighting fixtures of
sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are permitted
access, including both the interior of viewing booths and restrooms, at an
illumination level of not less than five (5.0) foot candles as measured at
floor level.
      (10)   The illumination described above shall be maintained at all times
that any patron is present in the premises. In the event of a power failure,
the business shall stop operating immediately and all patrons shall be cleared
from the premises. The premises shall not be reopened until the minimum
illumination level can be assured.
      (11)   No openings of any kind shall be permitted to exist between
viewing booths or in any wall of a viewing booth.
      (12)    No person shall make or attempt to make an opening of any kind
between viewing booths or in any wall of a viewing booth.
      (13)    The walls of each viewing booth shall be inspected regularly
during each business day to determine if any openings or holes exist.
      (14)    All floor coverings in viewing booths shall be nonporous, easily
cleanable surfaces, with no rugs or carpeting.
      (15)    All wall surfaces, ceiling surfaces and seating surfaces in
viewing booths shall be constructed of, or permanently covered by, nonporous,
easily cleanable material.
   (b)    A person who operates a sexually oriented business or his agent or
employee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree if he operates a
sexually oriented business in violation of subsection (a) hereof.
1193.20 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS FOR OPERATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
   (a)    Nudity, Sexual Activity, Live Entertainment and Performances. The

to entertainers.
      (1)    No employee on the premises of a sexually oriented business may

      (6)    Any live entertainment that is provided on the premises of a
sexually oriented business, in a private or semi-private room, must take place
in the direct, unobstructed line of sight of an employee's station at which at
least one employee is on duty and stationed at all times during which such
entertainment takes place, with all doors to such room completely open and
ajar, if such room is not considered a "viewing booth" under Section
1193.02 and therefore is not subject to the provisions of Section
1193.19.
   (b)    Dressing Rooms. All sexually oriented businesses that offer live
entertainment must provide separate dressing room facilities for female and
male entertainers which shall not be occupied or used in any way by any one
other than entertainers.
   (c)    Minors Prohibited. No person under the age of 18 years shall be
permitted on the premises of a sexually oriented business.
   (d)    Hours of Operation. No sexually oriented business shall remain open
at any time between the hour of 2:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and

sexually oriented business during those hours.
   (e)    Minimum Lighting Level.
      (1)    The premises of every sexually oriented business shall be equipped

or specified anatomical areas, as defined in Section
1193.02, or any person in a state of nudity or semi-nudity, whether by means of
display, decoration, sign, window or any other means.
   (g)    Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any person who
violates subsection (a) hereof; or any person who operates a sexually oriented
business and knowingly permits a violation of subsection (a) hereof on the
premises; shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of
subsection (a) hereof, a violation of subsection (a) hereof will be considered
a misdemeanor of the third degree If the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) hereof, a violation of
subsection (a) hereof will be considered a misdemeanor of the second degree If
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three
violations of subsection (a) hereof; a violation of subsection (a) hereof will
be considered a misdemeanor of the first degree.

fourth degree.
   (j)    Any operator of a sexually oriented business or his agent or employee
who recklessly violates, or operates a sexually oriented business in violation
of subsection (c) hereof commits a misdemeanor of the second degree. Mistake of
age is not a defense to a charge under this section, unless the person under
age eighteen (18) who was permitted on the premises exhibited to the operator
or his agent or employee a draft card, driver's license, birth record, or other
official or apparently official document purporting to show that the person was
eighteen (18) years of age or over, and the person to whom that document was
exhibited did not otherwise have reasonable cause to believe that the person
seeking admittance was under eighteen years old.
1193.21  LOITERING, EXTERIOR LIGHTING AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    It shall be the duty of the operator of a sexually oriented business
to:
      (1)    Initiate and enforce a no loitering policy within the external

located;
      (2)    Post conspicuous signs stating that no loitering is permitted on
such property;

visual inspection or video monitoring to prohibit loitering. The video cameras
and monitors shall operate continuously at all times that the premise is open
for business. The monitors shall be installed within a manager's station.
   (b)    It shall be unlawful for a person having a duty under this section to
knowingly fail to fulfill that duty.
1193.22  INJUNCTION.

1363.05 NOTICE TO ABATE.
        (a) Notice to Abate. Upon determining that a public nuisance exists on
a property, the Code Enforcement Officer shall cause written notice to be
served upon the owner(s), in accordance with this Section. The notice shall
state that unless such nuisance is so abated or removed, the cost thereof will
be charged to the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining
the nuisance and such cost shall be a lien on the real property where the
nuisance was abated or removed. Such notice shall also state that the failure
of such owner, occupant or person to abate the nuisance as required by such
notice shall be deemed an implied consent for the Village to abate or remove
such nuisance. Such implied consent shall be deemed to form a contract between
such owner, occupant or person and the Village. If the public nuisance does not
constitute a great and immediate danger to the public health, safety or
welfare, the Code Enforcement Officer or designee may serve the owner or
occupant of such premises or the person in whose name such real estate was last
billed for property tax purposes a notice to demand the abatement or removal of
the violation within a reasonable amount of time as determined by the Code
Enforcement Officer. Service may be had by certified mail or personal service;
or by posting the notice on the property and mailing a copy of the notice by
first class mail. In the notice provided under this Section the Code
Enforcement Officer shall inform the person responsible that committing another
violation of the same or similar nature of any provisions of this code within a
year of the date of the original notice, the Village will proceed with the
prosecution of said violation without further notification. The notice to abate
shall contain a statement as to the right to request an opinion.
 
       (b) Request for Opinion. The person upon whom a notice to abate a
nuisance is served, the property owner, lessee, agent, tenant or person having
charge or care of the subject land may request an opinion from the Planning and
Zoning Commission as to the determination of nuisance. The written appeal must
be made within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice. The Planning and Zoning
Commission may extend the time in which the nuisance must be abated; determine
that a nuisance does not or no longer exists; or that the nuisance must be
abated within the time period set out in the notice or immediately if the
period set out in the notice has run, provided, however, that if the nuisance
was determined to be an emergency and that the opportunity for an appeal was
not available due to the short period of time to abate the nuisance, an appeal
may be heard after the abatement of the nuisance by the Village. In that event,
the Planning and Zoning Commission may determine that the appellant is not
liable for the costs, or that, upon good cause shown, the appellant is not
liable for the costs, that a lien shall not be filed by the Village upon the
property.
(c) Procedure When Owner Fails to Comply. The Code Enforcement Officer may
determine that the public nuisance for which a notice has been issued under
Section
1363.05 hereof constitutes a public nuisance pursuant to Section
1363.02 and that the person having charge or care of the land has failed to
comply with the notice within the time specified in the notice. The Code
Enforcement Officer or his designee may cause the abatement of such public

1701.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Municipality of Obetz has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. (Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-
06.)
1701.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1701.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
      (Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1701.04 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Obetz as identified in Section
1701.05, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Municipality of Obetz.
(Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1701.05 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study for Franklin County and Incorporated Areas,
dated September 19, 2007.
   (b)   Flood Insurance Rate Map Numbers 39049C0426K, 39049C0427K,
39049C0431K, and 39049C0339K, all dated June 17, 2008.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Municipality of Obetz as required by Section
1704.04 Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments. Any revisions to the
aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on
file at the Government Center, 4175 Alum Creek Drive, Obetz, Ohio. (Ord. 03-09.
Passed 2-9-09.)
1701.06 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations. (Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1701.07 INTERPRETATION.
In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1701.08 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Municipality of Obetz, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1701.09 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)

   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)” means the Executive
Order issued by President Carter in 1977, that requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from (1) The overflow of
inland or tidal waters, and/or (2) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff
of surface waters from any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means the zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.

the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE” means the base flood elevation
plus 2 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that meets one or more of the
following criteria:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC’s are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) - A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) - A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) - A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park” means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. (See Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01)
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” means the Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
(Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Obetz Flood Insurance Rate Map, January 16, 1981, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
(Ord. 42-06. Passed 11-27-06.)
   (aa)   “Person” means any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area also known as Areas of Special Flood
Hazard” means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)    “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home,
or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include (1) Any improvement to a structure which is
considered “new construction”; (2) Any project for improvement of a structure
to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified prior to the application for a
development permit by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (3) Any alteration of a
"historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Chapter
1705 , Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field

   The Planning and Zoning Commission as established in Chapter
1181.01 of the Codified Ordinances shall serve as the Appeals Board. (Ord. 12-
06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1705.02 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations. All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public
except that the Appeals Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of
quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question
and shall keep records of all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board
shall be kept and filed in the Village of Obetz Government Center, 4175 Alum

(Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1705.03 APPEALS.
   (a)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within ten (10) calendar days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall hear the
appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting, give notice in writing to
parties in interest, and decide the appeal within sixty (60) calendar days
following the meeting at which the appeal is heard unless a tabling has been
requested by the individual requesting the appeal.
(Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1705.04 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application Process.  
      (1)   Fifteen copies of the completed application along with a fee of
$100 shall be filed with the Floodplain Administrator at least thirty-five (35)
days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information:
         A.   Name, address, and phone number of the applicant(s) and
representative(s) if any, and the signature of the property owner(s).
         B.   A current and accurate legal description of the property(s) in
    question and a current survey prepared by a licensed surveyor.
         C.   A description of the existing use and the proposed use (if
   applicable).
         D.   A description of the variance sought and the reason for the
variance request including what provisions of the Floodplain Regulations are
affected.
         E.   A list of all property owners within, contiguous to, and directly
across the street from the property(s) in question. The list of addresses may
correspond to the County Auditor's current tax list.
         F.   A plot plan to show:
            1.   Boundaries and dimensions of the property and the size and
location of all proposed and existing structures.
            2   The nature of the special conditions or circumstances.
            3.   The proposed use of all parts of the lot and structures.
            4.   The location of the floodplain.
            5.   The use of land and location of structures on adjacent
properties.
            6.   Such additional information as may be required by this Appeals
Board and/or requested by the Floodplain Administrator to review the
application.
   (b)   Review Procedure.
      (1)   Public Notice for Hearing. At least one (1) notice shall be given
at least ten (10) days prior to a scheduled public hearing in one (1) or more
newspapers of general circulation in the Municipality. Such notice shall    
include the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the    
proposed variance(s).
      (2)   Notice to Property Owners. Written notice of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Municipality at least ten (10) days prior to the date of a
scheduled public hearing to all property owners as listed under Section
1705.04(a)(1)E. The notice shall correspond to subsection (b)(1) hereof in
content.
      (3)   Procedure at Hearings.
         A.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
         B.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
         C.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
         D.   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
         E.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
         F.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
         G.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
         H.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing    and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the    community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (12)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         F.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size \contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1705.04(c)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 12-06. Passed 5-8-06.)
1705.05 APPEAL TO THE COURT.
   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals Board may appeal such
decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter
2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
