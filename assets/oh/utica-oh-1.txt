EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Codified Ordinances is indicated.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

121.01 RULES GOVERNING MEETINGS AND PROCEEDINGS.
   It is necessary in order to conduct the business of Council that a system of
rules be adopted and henceforth the following rules shall govern all regular
and special meetings unless, by a majority vote of those present, such rules
are suspended or modified.
Rule 1 - Meetings.  Regular meetings each year shall be held on the first
Monday of each month commencing at 7:30 p.m. local time unless otherwise
established by Council when setting meeting dates at the first meeting of the
calendar year.
Rule 2 -Special Meetings. Special meetings may be called by the Mayor or any
three members of Council upon giving at least twelve hours notice to each
Council member, served personally or left at the member's usual place of
business. However, if all members of Council are present at the special
meeting, giving of notice is considered to be waived. In addition, individual
members or all members of Council can expressly waive notice.
Rule 3 - Opening Proceeding. The Mayor shall take the chair at the time
appointed for Council to meet, and shall immediately call the members to order;
he shall then cause the minutes of the preceding meeting to be read and
disposed of, unless otherwise ordered by Council shall perform such duties as
are imposed upon the Mayor. In the absence of both the Mayor and the President
Pro Tempore of Council, Council may appoint a temporary chairman to conduct the
meeting.
Rule 4 - Presiding Officer. The Mayor shall preserve order and decorum, and
confine members in debate to the question. He may in common with any other
member, call any member to order who shall violate any of the rules, and shall,
when in the chair, decide all questions of order, subject to any appeal to
Council on the demand of two members. On such appeal there shall be no debate,
but the member making the appeal may briefly state his reasons for the same,
and the
presiding officer shall have the same right to a similar statement. The
presiding officer shall have no vote except in the case of a tie.
Rule 5 - President Pro Tempore of Council.  Each year at the first meeting in
January, Council shall select one of its members to serve as President Pro
Tempore of Council for the ensuing year. The person so selected shall, in the
absence or disability of the Mayor, preside over all meetings of Council with
the same power and authority exercised by the Mayor.
Rule 6 - Standing Committees.
   (a)    No later than the first regular meeting of Council after its
organization, the Mayor shall appoint standing committees, each consisting of
three members the first named to be chairman, of the following named subjects:
      (1)   Finance
      (2)    Public Service
      (3)    Street
      (4)    Light
   (b)    The Mayor, or Council by a majority vote, may at any time remove any
member or members of any committee.
   (c)    The Finance Committee shall maintain general oversight of budgetary
matters; shall review pending legislation to determine compliance with proposed
expenditures or revenues and the effect on existing legislation and available
funds; shall make recommendations to Council on financial affairs of the
Municipality; and shall review bills prior to Council Meetings.
   (d)    The Public Service Committee shall be charged with oversight of the
Police Department; shall study mattersof concern affecting that Department or
the public safety and shall review legislation proposed making such
recommendations as the Committee deems best; shall oversee the Park Board;
shall deal with personnel matters of any Village employee; shall oversee Cable
TV operations; and shall act as liaison with. County governances.
   (e)    The Street Committee shall review actions of the Street Department;

construction of streets, curbs, lawns or sidewalks and make recommendations to
Council concerning same; and shall oversee Town Hall maintenance.

rates, service or facilities of any utility operating within the Municipality
and make such recommendations to Council as are deemed best; shall act as
liaison with the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs; and shall review any
nuisance complaints.
(Ord. 84-12. Passed 4-8-85.)
Rule 7 - Order of Business.
   (a)   The business of regular meetings of Council shall be transacted in the
following order:
      (1)   Call to order and roll call;
      (2)   Pledge of Allegiance;
      (3)   Approval of minutes of previous meeting;
      (4)   Public participation;
      (5)   Ordinances and resolutions;
      (6)   Business of Solicitor;
      (7)   Committee reports;
      (8)   Old business;
      (9)   New business;
      (10)   Business of the Mayor;
      (11)   Business of the Fiscal Officer;
      (12)   Payment of bills;
      (13)   Adjournment.
   (b)   The presiding officer may at any time permit a member of Council to
introduce an ordinance, motion, or resolution out of the regular order for the
same, unless objected to by a majority of the members present.
   (c)   Members of the public will be recognized to address Council during
both Sessions of Public Comments. Each speaker shall be limited to five
minutes, provided that the presiding officer may impose different reasonable
time limitations and may also grant time extensions. (Ord. 23-005. Passed 4-10-
23.)
Rule 8 - Quorum; Majority. A majority of the members elected to Council shall
constitute a quorum to do business, but a lesser number may adjourn from day to
day. A majority vote of those present at a meeting at which there is a quorum
is sufficient to pass any measure other than an ordinance or resolution. An
ordinance or resolution shall require the favorable vote of at least a majority
of the members elected to Council.
Rule 9 - Legislation.
   (a)   Ordinances and resolutions are to be prepared or approved by the
Solicitor before final passage. They shall be given a first reading and may be
referred to the committee concerned with the subject matter of the next Council
meeting. Committees may also report ordinances or resolutions for first
hearing. Each member of Council, the Mayor, the Fiscal Officer and the
Solicitor shall be furnished with a complete copy of any ordinance or
resolution introduced.
   (b)   Council may accept or reject any committee report, in whole or in
part. The Solicitor has the responsibility of preparing legislation in the
manner prescribed by law. The committees to which legislation is referred shall
not concern themselves with the fulfillment of legal requirements. They will
only determine whether the subject matter has been fully covered. Example: The
Finance Committee may request certain salary adjustments be made. Council may
approve the request and vote to have the necessary legislation prepared by the
Solicitor. The legislation at first hearing would be referred to the Finance
Committee to determine whether all of the adjustments are included. Members and
committees may prepare ordinances but they must be approved by the Solicitor as
to form before the third reading or a vote for passage.
   (c)   Each ordinance or resolution shall be read by title only unless by
majority vote, Council directs it to be read in full.
   (d)   After three separate readings the ordinance or resolution shall be
ready for passage. A member may then move for its passage and, after seconding
and discussion, a final vote shall be taken. If a majority approves the
legislation, it shall be signed by the Fiscal Officer and presiding officer and
shall take effect as provided by law. The Fiscal Officer shall record each vote
by yeas and nays and enter the same upon the journal.
Rule 10 - Suspension of the Rules. If an ordinance or resolution is presented
to Council requiring immediate action, the presiding officer should entertain a
motion to suspend the rules. If three- fourths of the members approve the
motion, the Fiscal Officer shall record such vote by yeas and nays on the
journal and further readings thereof shall be dispensed with. The legislation
shall then be ready for passage.
Rules 11 - Effective Date of Legislation.
   (a)   Ordinances and resolutions which are passed in the ordinary course of
business and which do not contain an emergency clause, shall take effect and be
in force from and after thirty days after passage unless the ordinance or
resolution contains a later date.
   (b)   Emergency ordinances and resolutions deemed necessary for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety in the
Municipality shall so state, shall contain the reasons therefor, and shall take
effect immediately upon passage.
   (c)   Appropriation ordinances for current expenses of the Municipality
shall take effect immediately upon passage.
Rule 13 - Reference to Committees.  Any report, resolution, ordinance or matter
before Council for consideration, except appropriation ordinances, before their
final passage, may be referred either to the standing committee to which the
subject matter is most closely related or to a committee specially appointed by
the presiding officer. Any such committee shall consider the matter thus
referred to it and report thereon to Council without unnecessary delay.
Rule 14 - Committee Meetings. Notice of each committee meeting shall be filed
with the Clerk of Council and each meeting shall be open to the public. Any
committee may require any Village officer to confer with it and provide
information needed in connection with any matter pending before the committee.
Rule 15 - Motions: Order of Preference. When a question or proposition is
before Council, or under debate, no motion shall be received except the
following:
      To adjourn,
      To lay on the table,
      For the previous question,
all of which shall be decided without debate.
Rule 16 - Amendments. These rules may be amended or altered or new rules
adopted by a vote of the majority of all members elected at any meeting of
Council.
Rule 17 - Punishment and Expulsion of Members. Council may punish or expel any
member for disorderly conduct or violation of its rules, and declare his seat
vacant for absence without valid excuse, where such absence has continued for
two months. No expulsion shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds
of all the members elected, and until the delinquent member has been notified
of the charge against him and has had an opportunity to be heard.

days immediately preceding and immediately following the observed holiday. If
the employee has not worked a scheduled work day either before or after, he or
she shall be paid the regular pay. If a part-time employee works on a holiday,
he or she shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half times the regular rate,
provided he or she has worked the scheduled work days immediately preceding and
immediately following the holiday. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “the
holiday” shall be the day identified in subsection (a) of this section and not
a Friday or Monday preceding or following a holiday which falls on a weekend as
provided in subsection (c) of this section. If the part-time employee has not
worked a scheduled work day either before or after the holiday, that employee
shall be paid the regular rate of pay. Any employee who substitutes for another
employee scheduled to work on a holiday other than the “Floating Birthday”
holiday shall be paid based on the regular rate of pay of the employee who
actually works.

   (c)   When sick leave is used, it shall be deducted from the employee’s
credit on the basis of one hour for every hour of absence from previously

employment in the Village, provided that such re-employment takes place within
ten years of the date on which the employee was last terminated from the
Village. The Mayor shall require an employee to furnish a satisfactory written,
signed statement to justify the use of sick leave.
   (d)   If medical attention is required and three or more consecutive days of
sick leave are used, a certificate from a licensed physician stating the nature
of the illness shall be required to justify the use of sick leave.
Falsification of either a written, signed statement or a physician’s
certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary action including, but not limited
to dismissal. (Ord. 93-3. Passed 4-12-93.)
   (e)   Sick leave upon termination of employment shall be as follows:
      (1)   No sick leave may be granted to a Village employee upon or after
his or her retirement or termination of employment.

sick leave to be paid such retiring employees shall be as follows:
         A.   One-fourth of the accumulated sick leave up to thirty days; plus
         B.   One additional day of sick leave for each completed year of
service with the Village, up to a maximum of thirty additional days. No such

work week. The provisions shall not apply to work performed on paid holidays,
the working on such days being provided for elsewhere in this chapter.
151.11 WORK ENVIRONMENT.
   (a)   Attendance. Reporting to work on time, regular attendance during all
scheduled hours of work, and continuing to work to the end of the work period
are required of every employee. Employees who frequently are late to work shall
have their pay reduced proportionately. A written warning for repeated
tardiness will be given an employee prior to any pay reduction.
   (b)   Absence.
      (1)   Absence for any reason must be reported to the department head at
least thirty minutes prior to the scheduled starting time.
      (2)   Three consecutive days absence without reporting shall be
considered willful resignation.
      (3)   The Village maintains the right to investigate any employee’s
absence.
   (c)   Safety and Accidents.
      (1)   Different departments have varying safety rules relating to the
type of function performed within the department. The employee’s immediate
department head will acquaint the employee with the safety rules applicable to
the job and department.
      (2)   All employees working for the Village are covered by Worker’s
Compensation. Employees must file an immediate written report with the
department head for all injuries sustained while on the job.
   (d)   Expense Reimbursement. Expenses incurred by employees in carrying out
authorized Village business shall be reimbursed. However, approval for such
expenses must be obtained in writing from the department head or Fiscal Officer
prior to incurring such expenses. Reimbursement for mileage in the use of an
employee’s personal motor vehicle shall be at the rate promulgated by the
Internal Revenue Service for Federal income tax purposes.
   (e)   Clothing Allowance. Those employees whose duties necessitate the use
of special protective clothing or uniforms or whose duties would cause damage
to personal clothing shall be entitled to a clothing allowance in the amount to
be established by Council.
   (f)   Alcohol, Drugs and Gambling.
      (1)   Alcoholic beverages of any kind are not to be consumed by employees
during the course of any work day, including break or meal period. In addition,
no employee shall keep alcoholic beverages on Village property or report to
work with the odor of alcohol on his or her presence. Detection of alcohol or
the effects of alcohol on employees is a serious breach of policy which can
lead to discharge.
      (2)   Suspicion of selling or bringing drugs on Village premises will be
directed to the Mayor. Findings will determine further action. Drug abuse can
result in dismissal.
      (3)   Unauthorized gambling, lotteries or games of chance operated by
individuals on Village property violate policy and can lead to discharge.
151.12 ESTABLISHMENT OF POSITIONS; COMPENSATION.
   (a)   All positions to be staffed by members of the work force shall be

   Duties to be performed by employees of the Water and Wastewater and Street
Departments shall be established by the Village Administrator. Duties to be
performed by the Assistant Fiscal Officer shall be established by the Fiscal
Officer. Duties to be performed by all other employees shall be established by
the Mayor or his designated representative.
(Ord. 90-9. Passed 7-9-90.)
151.14 DISCIPLINE.
   (a)   Discipline procedures exist to prevent or correct situations which may
jeopardize the employee’s welfare and the welfare of other employees or the
Village.
   The following indicates the Village’s approach toward discipline:
      (1)   Warnings. Warnings may be oral or written. The object of the
initial contact with any employee who has apparently violated a rule or
regulation is to gather all the facts relevant to the situation prior to making
a judgment. If a rule or regulation has been violated, an oral warning is
normally sufficient for the first offense, unless the seriousness of the case
demands stronger action. A written warning normally will be given for repeated
violation.
      (2)   Discharge for cause. When an employee’s action is of a very serious
nature the above procedure may be disregarded and immediate dismissal
instituted as follows:
         A.   If an employee is dismissed, the employee will receive his or her
final pay according to the scheduled normal pay plan period as defined
elsewhere in this chapter.
         B.   The individual responsible for informing the employee of the
dismissal shall inform the employee of the reason(s) for the dismissal, and
shall present the employee with a termination memorandum containing the
following information: the name and position of the employee, the date of
termination, the reason(s) for termination, a list of any previous disciplinary
actions taken against that employee, and the signature of the individual
responsible for informing the employee of the dismissal.
         C.   The employee shall be requested to sign the termination
memorandum indicating that the employee has received and read a copy of the
memorandum. If the employee refuses to sign the memorandum, the reason(s) for
dismissal should be explained to the employee in the presence of a witness. The
witness shall then sign the termination memorandum and shall indicate on that
form the employee’s refusal to sign.
            (Ord. 90-26. Passed 12-10-90.)
   (b)   When the Mayor has reason to believe that a member of the police
service has been guilty of incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, bribery,
drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the
public, neglect of duty, or any other act of misfeasance, malfeasance or
nonfeasance in the performance of duty, he shall take such action as is
required, and the hearing and disposition of such charges shall be made as
provided in Ohio R.C. 737.171.
   (c)   Employees other than those covered by subsection (b) hereof, may be
removed at any regular meeting of Council. At such meeting, the employee
subject to removal shall have the right to be heard in person or by counsel,
and to present evidence and to examine and cross- examine any witness. Removal
of employees under this subsection shall be without cause and in the discretion
of Council.
151.15 RETIREMENT AGE.
   (a)   Each police officer in the employ of the Village shall retire at an
age no later than sixty-two (62) years, unless the Village receives, as set
forth below, a physician’s report indicating that the officer is physically
able to continue in the capacity of a police officer. For an officer over the
age of sixty-two years to continue employment as a police officer, the Village
must receive a physician’s report every two years, which report must indicate
that the officer is physically able to continue in the capacity of a police
officer. Council has determined that the vast majority of officers over the age
of sixty-two years may be physically incapable of performing the strenuous
physical duties required of police officers in their normal line of duty. To
the extent that certain individuals over the age of sixty-two may be physically
capable of performing such duties, Council has determined that each officer,
when he or she reaches the age of sixty-two, and every two years thereafter, be
required to take a physical exam to determine whether that officer is
physically able to continue in the capacity of a police officer. A doctor will
be specified by the Village of Utica to conduct the required physical exam at
Village of Utica’s expense.
   (b)   Except as provided in subsection (a) hereof, Village employees shall
not be required to retire at any given age, but may continue to serve so long
as they are physically and mentally capable of performing assigned task.
(Ord. 04-009. Passed 9-13-04.)
151.16 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   Any regular employee of the Village may invoke the grievance procedures, as
established by this section to seek redress for alleged wrongs relating to
conditions of work, administration of this chapter or other job related
concerns.
   (a)   The employee shall verbally inform his department head of the nature
and details of the grievance. The department head shall, within three days,
counsel the employee in a private manner which will not embarrass the employee.
Every effort will be made to settle the grievance in a manner satisfactory to
both parties.
   (b)   If the grievance is not settled according to the procedure set forth
in subsection (a) hereof, or if the employee has no immediate department head
other than the Mayor, the employee shall in writing inform the Mayor of the
nature and details of the grievance. The Mayor shall, within three working
days, counsel the employee in a private manner which will not embarrass the
employee. Every effort will be made to settle the grievance in a manner
satisfactory to both parties.
   (c)   If the grievance remains unsettled, the employee shall file a written
description of the nature and details of the grievance with the Mayor and with
the Fiscal Officer. The Mayor shall, within five working days after receiving
the written grievance, provide a written reply to the employee, and a copy
shall be filed with the Fiscal Officer. Such written reply shall specify the
findings and conclusions of the Mayor.
   (d)   If the grievance remains unsettled, the employee may refer the
grievance in writing to Council for determination. Upon notification by the
employee, the Fiscal Officer shall submit copies of all written material filed
with the Fiscal Officer according to subsection (c) hereof, to the members of
Council. Council, or a committee of Council, shall hear and consider the
grievance within thirty days after receiving the written material. The decision
of Council shall be final.
151.17 JURY DUTY.
   (a)   Employees required to perform jury duty or serve as court witnesses
under summons or subpoena will receive full pay for time away from work.
   (b)   In the event a part-time Village employee appears in any Court
proceeding as a witness for the Village, which appearance requires that he take
time away from employment with an employer other than the Village, such
employee shall be compensated at the higher of the rate paid by the Village or
such other employer for such time away from work.
   (c)   In order for any employee to qualify for payment under this section,
such employee must pay over to the Village department head all jury duty fees
and/or witness fees, exclusive of travel, lodging and meal allowances, and
compensation received from such other employer, if any, for payment to the
Village general fund.
(Ord. 87-29. Passed 10-5-87.)
151.18 MATERNITY/ADOPTION LEAVE.
   (a)   Employees of the Village who become pregnant, or employees who are
adopting a child, and who desire to return to work at a future date, shall be
granted maternity or adoption leave for up to nine weeks, which may be extended
upon agreement of both parties.
   (b)   Application for maternity or adoption leave shall be in writing, and
shall contain a statement of the expected date of birth, or in the case of
adoption, the date of obtaining custody, the date on which the leave of absence
is to commence and the intended date of return to service. Such written
application shall be submitted sixty days in advance of the beginning date of
the leave.
   (c)   Employees shall be entitled to the use of sick leave pay during
maternity or adoption leave. The use of such sick leave with pay shall be
requested on the application for maternity/adoption leave. Upon exhaustion of
all available/earned vacation and sick leave, maternity leave shall revert to
leave without pay status.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-7-89.)
   (d)   Upon return from approved maternity/adoption leave at the time set
forth in the application for leave, the employee shall be entitled to
reinstatement to the same position which was held prior to the leave or to an
equivalent position.
      (1)   An employee, who because of miscarriage, other unforeseen
circumstances or a personal desire to return to service, and who is physically
able to resume her duties before the stated intended date of return, may
present a medical certificate from the attending physician indicating the
employee’s ability to return at a date earlier than specified. After
presentation of such medical certificate, and upon approval of the Mayor, the
employee may return to service at a date earlier than specified. The Mayor may
withhold approval if the employee’s same or equivalent position is not
available until the end of scheduled maternity leave.
      (2)   The Village requires certification by a medical doctor that an
employee is physically able to perform all normal obligations upon intended
date of return from maternity leave. If the employee cannot present medical
certification declaring the employee to be physically fit to resume all such
obligations, the employee shall not be reinstated as an employee.
         (Ord. 90-17. Passed 10-8-90.)
   (e)   An employee who is on maternity leave shall receive continued
hospitalization, medical-surgical and major medical insurance benefits during
the authorized leave of absence, for up to three months. (Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-
7-89.)
151.19 UNIFORM ALLOWANCE.
   (a)   There is hereby created a new uniform allowance schedule. The initial
schedule shall go into effect for the calendar year 2016 and shall be as set
forth on attached Exhibit A. Only employees holding positions set forth on that
schedule shall be entitled to a uniform allowance. The schedule shall be
adjusted, by ordinance, at Council’s discretion, and shall remain as set forth
on Exhibit A until such time as an amended schedule is adopted.
   (b)   Payment of Allowance:  
      (1)   The Village may purchase uniform shirts for employees of the water,
wastewater and street departments in June of 2016 and January of each
subsequent year. Uniform shirts may also be purchased for new employees upon
hire. The cost of uniform shirts will count toward the uniform allowance.
      (2)   The Fiscal Officer shall pay the amount of uniform allowance that
remains for water, wastewater and street department employees after purchase of
the shirts described in paragraph (1) above, and all of the uniform allowance
for all other employees, according to the attached schedule, during June of
2016 and January of each subsequent year. This payment shall be made to each
full-time employee who is entitled to such allowance.
      (3)   Part-time employees who are required to work 400 hours to earn the
allowance shall be paid the allowance (or for water, wastewater & street
employees the remainder of the allowance after uniform shirt purchases) at the
end of the first pay period following the earning of a clothing allowance. No
more than one clothing allowance shall be paid to any employee in one calendar
year.
   
   (c)   The Fiscal Officer shall maintain a uniform allowance journal for each
employee who is entitled to a uniform allowance, noting the date and amount of
uniform allowance received by the said employee on or after January 1, 2016. In
these journals, the Fiscal Officer shall also note each Village uniform
purchase and each uniform purchase for which the employee provides an adequate
receipt or proof of purchase, together with the date of each such purchase.
   (d)   Purchases may exceed the allowances received in any or all years, and
allowances may exceed purchases in any given year. However, the information set
forth in each uniform allowance journal shall be provided annually by the
Fiscal Officer to the employee, the employee’s immediate supervisor, and the
Chief of Police (for Police Department employees) or the Village Administrator
(for street, water and waste water department employees).
   (e)   Failure to provide an adequate receipt or proof of uniform purchases
to prove the expenditure of the amount of at least one year’s annual allowance
in a three year period shall be cause for suspension of the clothing allowance,
as the employee who fails to provide such receipt or proof is not using the
allowance for the purpose for which it is intended. A clothing allowance
suspended in accordance with this subsection shall be reinstated only upon
submission of receipts or proofs of purchase which total the sum of all
allowances received through the three year term preceding the date upon which
the allowance was suspended.
   (f)   Employees will receive annually, upon request, a copy of their uniform
allowance journal or annual report from the Fiscal Officer, advising of uniform
allowance usage.
   (g)   The following clothing items are acceptable for uniform purchases to
be noted in the uniform allowance journals: uniform caps, hats, shirts, coats
and jackets identified with a patch, embroidery, silk screen or by other means
as being worn by a representative of the Village of Utica or a division of the
Village government; uniform pants; patches, embroidery, markings, rank
insignia, standard policy uniform accessories; gloves, boots, weapons,
holsters, and such other items worn as standard uniform and approved by the
appropriate division supervisor.
   (h)   The following items are not acceptable for clothing allowance purposes
and shall not be noted in the uniform allowance journals: socks, except those
specific to outdoor winter wear; underwear, except thermal or that specific to
outdoor winter wear; shirts, jackets, hats and coats that do not bear the name
of the Village or division of employment, and pants not specific to the
matching uniform shirts worn by the employee. Exceptions to these rules may
apply to the Village Administrator and Chief of Police, upon approval of the
Mayor, due to the fact that duty assignments of the Administrator and Chief
involve both clerical duties and service to the community.
   (i)   If the amount of any clothing allowance paid to any employee in a
calendar year, less receipts and proofs of purchase noted in the employee’s
uniform allowance journal, exceeds five hundred dollars ($500.00) in a calendar
year, the Fiscal Officer shall be required to issue an IRS form 1099 to the
employee. Regardless of the above requirement, each employee shall be
responsible for any income taxes due on clothing allowances paid for which
receipts or proofs of purchase are not provided to the Fiscal Officer in the
calendar year in which received.
(Ord. 16-012. Passed 5-2-16.)

to further public purposes.

activity is detected, the employee is to gather all related documentation,
write a description of the situation and present this information to the
Program Coordinator who will then complete additional authentication to
determine the appropriate response. (Ord. 09-016. Passed 11-9-09.)

report and receives a notice from a consumer reporting agency of an address
discrepancy, the appropriate employee shall establish that the consumer report
relates to the consumer about whom the Village (or applicable service provider)
has requested the consumer report. This may be done by: verification of the
address with the consumer, review of the utility’s records, verification of the
address through third-party sources, or other reasonable means.
(Ord. 09-016. Passed 11-9-09.)
153.09 UPDATING PROGRAM.
   This chapter shall be updated periodically to reflect changes in risks to
customers or to the safety and soundness of the Village from identify theft
based on factors such as: the experiences of the Village with identity theft,

theft. The reports by staff shall address material matters related to this
chapter and evaluate issues such as: the effectiveness of the chapter in
addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered
accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts, significant incidents
involving identity theft and the Village’s response, and recommendations for
material changes to the chapter. The Program Coordinator shall train staff, as
necessary, to effectively implement the chapter. The Program Coordinator shall
also oversee any service provider arrangements in the event that the Village
engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or
more covered accounts to assure that the activity of the service provider is
conducted in accordance with this chapter and any reasonable policies and
procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor’s Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor’s Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Contempt.
171.02   Failure of persons summoned to appear.
171.03   Clerk of Mayor’s Court.

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

         If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
181.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any

lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

returns required under this section.

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

181.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be

which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,

received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that

individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
           (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
181.30  of this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(b)(1) or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
            (5)    When an election made under Section
181.30  of this Chapter is terminated, a valid election made under Section
181.36  of this Chapter is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder
of the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
181.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality

181.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first

tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
181.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

181.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
181.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village but who received
net profits or qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered
outside of Village, and who has paid a municipal income tax on such net profits
or qualifying wages in another municipality, shall be allowed a credit for the
amount so paid by that individual taxpayer on his or her behalf in such other
municipality, such credit not to exceed one-half percent (1/2 %) of that
taxpayer's municipal taxable income. This credit is to be applied only to the
extent of the tax assessed by this chapter by reason of such net profits and
qualifying wages earned in such other minicipality where such tax is paid.
   (B)   This section shall not be construed to create a credit for any income
taxes paid to any school district under (1) school district income tax, or (2)

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extend
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section 181.081 of this
Chapter. (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section 181.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate
is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
181.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
181.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
181.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
181.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A) (2) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
181.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
181.10 of this Chapter.

and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this section shall be exercised by the Tax
Administrator only in connection with the performance of the duties

income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

      (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
 
181.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section 181.18
of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision,
finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of
Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
181.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-032. Passed 12-21-15.)

this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the
taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of each

      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to Sections

not less than sixty days before the effective date of the increase, after which
effective date the commissioner shall apply the increased rate.

taxpayer's notification of election under division (b) of this section, shall
submit to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner,
the following information regarding the taxpayer:
         (A)    The amount of any net operating loss that the taxpayer is
entitled to carry forward to a future tax year;
         (B)    The amount of any net operating loss carryforward utilized by
the taxpayer in prior years;
         (C)    Any credits granted by the municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer is entitled, the amount of such credits, whether the credits may be
carried forward to future tax years, and, if the credits may be carried
forward, the duration of any such carryforward;
         (D)    Any overpayments of tax that the taxpayer has elected to carry
forward to a subsequent tax year;
         (E)    Any other information the municipal corporation deems relevant
in order to effectuate the tax commissioner's efficient administration of the
tax on the municipal corporation's behalf.
      (3)    If any municipal corporation fails to timely comply with divisions
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the tax commissioner shall notify the director
of budget and management, who, upon receiving such notification, shall withhold
from each payment made to the municipal corporation under Section
181.33  of this Chapter fifty per cent of the amount of the payment otherwise
due to the municipal corporation under that section. The director shall compute
the withholding on the basis of the tax rate most recently certified to the tax
commissioner until the municipal corporation complies with divisions (c)(1) and
(2) of this section.
   (d)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the tax
commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (e)    No tax administrator shall utilize Sections
181.31  to
181.45  of this Chapter in the administrator's administration of a municipal
income tax, and those sections shall not be applied to any taxpayer that has
not made the election under this section.
   (f)    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to make any section of
this chapter, other than Sections
181.03  and
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter, applicable to the tax commissioner's administration of
a municipal income tax or to any taxpayer that has made the election under this
section.
   (g)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in Section
181.03  of this Chapter.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.31 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used
in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to
federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
181.03  of this Chapter, the definition in this section shall control for all
uses of that term in Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter.
   As used in Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter only:
   (a)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
181.32  of this Chapter, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating
loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (c)(23)(E)(ii) of Section
181.03  of this Chapter, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (A)    Except as provided in division (b)(4)(B) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (B)    Division (b)(4)(A) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         (C)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of
Section
181.36  of this Chapter.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(b) of Section
181.36  of this Chapter.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (c)(47)(B) of Section
181.03  of this Chapter, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made
the election described in division (c)(23)(E)(ii) of Section
181.03  of this Chapter, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable
income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
181.03 , except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer"
may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes,
and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
181.30 to
181.45 of this Chapter is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation
of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax
commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
181.40 .
      (Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.32 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
Section
181.30 .
   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
181.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (A)    Separate accounting;
         (B)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (D)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section
181.40  of this Chapter.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of Section
181.40  of this Chapter.
   (c)    As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)    The employer;
         (B)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)(B) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)    For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (A)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (B)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (c)(11)(L) of Section
181.03  and division (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code by a
municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its
net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation.
In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon
which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the
stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (g)    When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.33 CERTIFICATION OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.
   (a)    On or before the last day of each month, the tax commissioner shall
certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to each
municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and
declarations of estimated tax under Sections
181.35 and
181.38 of this Chapter, less any amounts previously distributed and net of any
audit adjustments made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for the calendar
month preceding the month in which the certification is made. Not later than
the fifth day of each month, the director shall provide for payment of the
amount certified to each municipal corporation from the municipal income tax
fund, plus a pro rata share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund
since the previous payment under this section. Each municipal corporation's
share of such earnings shall equal the proportion that the municipal
corporation's certified tax payment is of the total taxes certified to all
municipal corporations in that quarter. All investment earnings on money in the
municipal income tax fund shall be credited to that fund.
   (b)    If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a
taxable year exceeds the amount payable to that municipal corporation under
Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter after accounting for amounts remitted with the annual
return and as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall proceed according to
divisions (A) and (B) of section 5703.77 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.34 INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Sections
181.30  to

information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial
order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code. The
tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies of

   (b)    In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
each tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer that

municipal corporation and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.
   (d)    Not later than the thirty-first day of January of each year, every
municipal corporation having taxpayers that have made the election allowed
under Section
181.30  of this Chapter shall provide to the tax commissioner, in a format
prescribed by the commissioner, the name and mailing address of up to two
persons to whom the municipal corporation requests that the commissioner send
the information described in divisions (b) and (c) of this section. The
commissioner shall not provide such information to any person other than a
person who is designated to receive the information under this section and who
is employed by the municipal corporation or by a tax administrator, as defined
in Section
181.03  of this Chapter, that administers the municipal corporation's income
tax, except as may otherwise be provided by law.
   (e)   (1)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules that further govern the
terms and conditions under which tax returns filed with the commissioner under
this chapter, and any other information gained in the performance of the
commissioner's duties prescribed by this chapter, shall be available for
inspection by properly authorized officers, employees, or agents of the
municipal corporations to which the taxpayer's net profit is apportioned under
Section
181.32  of this Chapter.
      (2)    As used in this division, "properly authorized officer, employee,
or agent" means an officer, employee, or agent of a municipal corporation who

Section
181.41  of this Chapter or division (b) or (c) of this section, a municipal
corporation discovers that it has additional information in its possession that
could result in a change to a taxpayer's tax liability, the municipal
corporation may refer the taxpayer to the tax commissioner for an audit. Such
referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall
include any information that forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)    Upon receipt of a referral under division (f)(1) of this section,
the commissioner shall review the referral and may conduct an audit of the
taxpayer that is the subject of the referral based on the information in the
referral and any other relevant information available to the commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in division (f) of this section shall be construed as
forming the sole basis upon which the commissioner may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer.
      (4)    Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a municipal corporation
from filing a writ of mandamus if the municipal corporation believes that the
commissioner has violated the commissioner's fiduciary duty as the
administrator of the tax levied by the municipal corporation.
         (Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.35 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section
181.07  of this Chapter, shall be submitted to the tax commissioner, on a form
and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth
day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one

181.31 ,
181.32 , and, if applicable,
181.36  of this Chapter onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
   (b)   The tax commissioner shall immediately forward to the treasurer of
state all amounts the commissioner receives pursuant to Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter. The treasurer shall credit ninety-nine and one-half
per cent of such amounts to the municipal income tax fund and the remainder to
the municipal income tax administrative fund established under section 5745.03
of the Revised Code.
   (c)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall

         (B)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (d)   (1)   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (B)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (C)    An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code,
the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
   (e)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (f)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
   (b)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding
for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial
election unless a change in the reporting method is required under federal law.
The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period
unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
division (b)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
181.30  of this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(b)(1) or (2) of Section
181.063  of this Chapter is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
181.30  of this Chapter is terminated, a valid election made under this section
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (c)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.31  of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income"
for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (b) of Section
181.31  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (A)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.32  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.32  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (A)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
181.32  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (f)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
181.32  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.37 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
181.30  of this Chapter fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
Section
181.40  of this Chapter, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.38 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (A)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (A)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (B)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(b) of Section
181.35 .
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (A)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (C)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with Section
181.33  of this Chapter.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.39 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (A)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (B)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
181.30  of this Chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be
paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen
per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be
imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
181.30 to 181.95 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
181.41  of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed
under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund
from the date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
181.40  without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under Section
181.33 .
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.40 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
181.41  of this Chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (b)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (d)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
181.41  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.41 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (a) of Section
181.40  of this Chapter. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under Section
181.33  of this Chapter.
   (c)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.42 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
181.30  of this Chapter and used to determine the tax due under Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
181.40  of this Chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
181.41  of this Chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
181.41  of this Chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 18-010. Passed 6-18-18.)
181.43 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (b)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
181.30  to
181.45  of this Chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the

to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a

303.991  COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:

         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
 331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.

entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in

considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.
   (l)   Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension. If a person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under this section files an appeal regarding
any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s

construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident

4510.02.

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

            2.   Traveling to or from an official function sponsored by the
school the holder attends between the hours of one a.m. and five a.m., provided
that the holder has in the holder’s immediate possession written documentation
from an appropriate official of the school;
            3.   Traveling to or from an official religious event between the
hours of one a.m. and five a.m., provided that the holder has in the holder’s
immediate possession written documentation from an appropriate official
affiliated with the event.
      (3)   An employer, school official or official affiliated with a
religious event is not liable in damages in a civil action for any injury,
death or loss to person or property that allegedly arises from, or is related
to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

and holders of probationary driver’s licenses may utilize that form or may
choose to utilize any other written documentation to meet the requirements of
that subsection.

highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family
member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed that
required the holder of the probationary driver’s license to operate a motor
vehicle in violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. of this section; or the
holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   If a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months
or the date the holder attains the age of seventeen years, whichever occurs
first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
      (2)   “Family member” of a probationary license holder includes any of
the following:
         A.   A spouse;

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or
vehicle registration.

DRIVING.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

one of the following:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(3)B. or C. of this
section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the court may order, for sixty days, the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar of the termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and
notifies the Registrar, the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to
permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

an operator does not have a valid license, or insurance if the operator fails
to show proof of such upon being lawfully stopped.

Village limits. Moreover, no person shall operate a golf cart on any Village
street in the Village of Utica where the posted speed limit exceeds twenty-five

speed limit exceeds twenty-five (25) miles per hour provided they comply with
all other applicable state and local laws.
   (c)   Occupants of golf carts governed by this ordinance shall be seated at
all times on the seat of the golf cart and wearing a seat belt when the golf
cart is in motion. Standing on any portion of the golf cart when it is in

fourth degree; on each subsequent offense after the second offense the person
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

offense.

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this

   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

delicti remains undiscovered.

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section

      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,

unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
                                             Maximum
Type of Misdemeanor                           Fine

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11 , either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

531.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations shall have the meaning given herein. When not inconsistent
with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in
the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include
the plural. "Shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
   (a)    "Minor" means any person under the age of eighteen or, in equivalent
phrasing often herein employed, any person seventeen or less years of age.
   (b)    "Parent" means any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)    As a natural or adoptive parent;
      (2)    As a legal guardian;
      (3)    As a person who stands in loco parentis; or
      (4)    As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.
   (c)    "Remain" means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily
upon the streets, including the congregating of groups, or of interacting
minors, totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be
using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or
going home.
   (d)    "Street'' means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use
of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the
case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. "Street" includes the legal
right of way, including but not limited to the traffic lanes, the curb, the
sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found
within the legal right of way of a street. "Street" applies irrespective of
what it be called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or
otherwise.
   (e)    "Time of night" is based upon the prevailing standard of time,
whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, generally
observed at that hour by the public in the Municipality, prima facie the time
then observed in the Municipal Administrative Offices and Police Station.
   (f)    "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth
to, but not including the day of, the next, such as the eighteenth birthday,
making it clear that seventeen or less years of age is herein treated as
equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen years of age". Similarly, for example,
eleven or less years of age means under twelve years of age.
531.02 CURFEW HOURS.
   No person seventeen or less years of age shall be or remain in or upon the
street within the Municipality at night during the period of time commencing at
10:30 p.m. and ending at 5:30 a.m.
531.03 EXCEPTIONS.
   In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a street during the nocturnal
hours for which Section
531.02 is intended to prove the maximum limits of regulation shall not be
considered in violation of this chapter:
   (a)    When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   (b)    When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take the parent’s place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   (c)    When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United State
Constitution such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
first delivering, to communications center personnel at the Municipal Building,
where and by whom high priority messages to the Chief of Police are regularly
received, written communication signed by such minor and countersigned if
practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone
number, addressed to the Chief of Police specifying when, where and in what
matter the minor will be on the streets at night, during the hours when this
chapter is otherwise applicable to the minor, in the exercise of a First
Amendment right specified in such communication.
   (d)    In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent
has communicated to the Police station personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a
described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of such
communication or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of
Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received
and of the names and address of such parent and minor, shall be admissible
evidence.
   (e)    When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.
    (f)   When returning home, by a direct route from, and within thirty
minutes of the termination of a school activity, or an activity of a religious
or other voluntary association, of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for
immediate reference by, the Chief of Police of the officer assigned by him on
duty at the Police Station.
   (g)    When the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each
calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more
than forty-five days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and place of employment and
his hours of employment.
   (h)    When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle.
   (i)    Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations, such
as provisions for notification, are severable, and additional, also severable
exceptions, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled
respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be considered by
Council as warranteed by future experience illuminated by the views of student
government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward,
precinct and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority
concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.
531.04 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or by
inefficient control, allow such minor to be or remain upon any street under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this chapter. "Knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
531.05 POLICE PROCEDURES.
   A policeman, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the
streets in prima facie violation of this chapter, normally shall take the minor
to the Police station, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for
such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access
to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a
birth certificate, a policeman on the street shall in the first instance, use
his best judgment in determining age.
   (a)    Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a
parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example, a minor of
tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or
are known.
   (b)    When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except the the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will on
behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   (c)    In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of the violation with
a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this
chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable
penalties.
531.99 PENALTY.
   If, after the warning notice pursuant to Section
531.05 of a first violation by a minor, a parent violates Section
531.04 in connection with a second violation by such minor, this shall be
treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a
parent shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and for each subsequent offense,
a parent shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2)       hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them
as a single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

(30) days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to correct the violation
before the Village may impose liquidated damages unless the violation is of

proceeds diligently within the thirty (30) days to cure the violation in which
case the Grantee must proceed diligently within the thirty (30) days to correct
the violation, or as promptly as possible thereafter to correct the violation.

skill or any person operating an electronic gaming parlor.
      (Ord. 07-003. Passed 4-9-07.)
   (b)    (1)   “Skill-based amusement machine” means a mechanical, video,
digital or electronic device that rewards the player or players, if at all,
only with merchandise prizes or with redeemable vouchers redeemable only for
merchandise prizes, provided that with respect to rewards for playing the game
all of the following apply:
         A.   The wholesale value of a merchandise prize awarded as a result of
the single play of a machine does not exceed ten dollars;
         B.   Redeemable vouchers awarded for any single play of a machine are
not redeemable for a merchandise prize with a wholesale value of more than ten
dollars;
         C.   Redeemable vouchers are not redeemable for a merchandise prize
that has a wholesale value of more than ten dollars ($10.00) times the fewest
number of single plays necessary to accrue the redeemable vouchers required to
obtain that prize; and
         D.   Any redeemable vouchers or merchandise prizes are distributed at
the site of the skill-based amusement machine at the time of play.
      (2)   A device shall not be considered a skill-based amusement machine
and shall be considered a slot machine if it pays cash or one or more of the
following apply:
         A.   The ability of a player to succeed at the game is impacted by the
number or ratio of prior wins to prior losses of players playing the game.
         B.   Any reward of redeemable vouchers is not based solely on the
player achieving the object of the game or the players’ score.
         C.   The outcome of the game, or the value of the redeemable voucher
or merchandise prize awarded for winning the game, can be controlled by a
source other than any player playing the game.
         D.   The success of any player is or may be determined by a chance
event that cannot be altered by player actions.
         E.   The ability of any player to succeed at the game is determined by
game features not visible or known to the player.
         F.   The ability of the player to succeed at the game is impacted by
the exercise of a skill that no reasonable player could exercise.
      (3)   All of the following apply to any machine that is operated as
described in subsection (b)(1) hereof:
         A.   As used in this section, “game” and “play” means one event from
the initial activation of the machine until the results of play are determined
without payment of additional consideration. An individual utilizing a machine
that involves a single game, play, contest, competition, or tournament
participation may be rewarded redeemable vouchers or merchandise prizes based
on the results of play.
         B.   Advance play for a single game, play, contest, competition, or
tournament participation may be purchased. The cost of the contest,
competition, or tournament participation may be greater than a single
noncontest, competition or tournament play.
         C.   To the extent that the machine is used in a contest, competition,
or tournament, that contest, competition, or tournament has a defined starting
and ending date and is open to participants in competition for scoring and
ranking results toward the awarding of redeemable vouchers or merchandise
prizes that are stated prior to the start of the contest, competition, or
tournament.
      (4)   For purposes of subsection (b)(1) hereof, the mere presence of a
device, such as a pin-setting, ball-releasing or scoring mechanism, that does
not contribute to or affect the outcome of the play of the game does not make
the device a skill-based amusement machine.

of the following:
      (1)   Cash, gift cards, or any equivalent thereof;

905.01 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO IMPROVING STREETS.
   No department of the Municipality shall accept, lay out, open, improve,
grade, pave, curb or light any street or other way, unless the street or way
has been accepted or opened or otherwise has received the legal status of a
public street or way prior to the effective date of this chapter or unless the
street or way corresponds in location and extent with a street or way shown on
a recorded plat which has been legally accepted by Council.
905.02 OPENING PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   No person, other than the Village Administrator, engineer, or the
authorized employees or agents of either, shall make any opening in any street,
alley, sidewalk, or public way of the Municipality unless a permit to make the
opening has been obtained prior to commencement of the work.
   (b)   Each permit for making an opening shall be confined to a single
project and shall be issued by the Village Administrator. Application shall be
made on a form prescribed by Council, giving the exact location of the proposed
opening, the kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated, and such other
facts as may be provided for. The permit shall be issued only after a cash
deposit sufficient to cover the cost of restoration has been posted with the
Village Administrator, conditioned upon prompt and satisfactory refilling of
excavations and restoration of all surfaces disturbed. This deposit may be
waived by the Mayor or Village Administrator upon a showing of good cause.
(Ord. 92-11. Passed 5-11-92.)
905.03 RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.

time specified in the permit or where not specified therein, within a
reasonable time after commencement of the work, the Municipality may proceed

the street repair fund of the Municipality, except such part demanded and paid
to the permittee as the difference between the deposit and the charges of the
Municipality for restoration services performed by it. If the amount of such
services performed by the Municipality should exceed the amount of the deposit,
the Clerk or other proper administrative officer shall proceed to collect the
remainder due from such permittee. (A.O.)
   (c)   Any hole opened in an asphalt paved surface shall be closed and
restored within seven days after its opening unless additional time is granted

three inches shall be filled with asphalt such as that commonly known as “hot
mix”. In the event hot mix is not available because of the weather at the time
of year in question, the hole shall be filled with the dirt and gravel mix to
the final surface level until such time as hot mix is available. Within thirty
days after hot mix is next reasonably available in the area, three inches of
dirt and gravel mix shall be removed and hot mix shall be placed in the opening
to the final surface of the pavement.

are received as well as the occupant of the real estate if the real estate is
not occupied by the owner and the water and sewer service account is in the
occupant’s name.
   (b)   All billings for regular and delinquent water and sewer shall be sent
to the occupant and a copy of the billing for delinquent water and sewer

   (c)   The owner and the occupant of the real estate referred to in
subsection (a) above shall be jointly and severally responsible for payment of
all water and sewer bills relating to the real estate.
   (d)   Water and sewer bills shall be rendered and payable monthly. All bills
are payable fifteen (15) calendar days after the mailing date of the bill. At
this date, the bill, if unpaid, shall be deemed delinquent and a surcharge will
be added as set forth in Section
921.08 hereof, and a delinquent bill be prepared and sent. Delinquent bills
shall be payable five (5) calendar days after the mailing date of the bill.
   (e)   Certain delinquent accounts are eligible for a payment plan as set
forth in this subsection:
      (1)   The payment plan is available only to any real estate owner or
occupant who is two months delinquent on payment of water and sewer bills and
has received a shutoff notice.
      (2)   The payment plan must be completed in writing and signed by the
account holder and an authorized Village Official or employee, prior to the due
date of the regular current (third) month’s bill.
      (3)   The delinquent amount plus the current (third) month’s bill is
totaled and divided by three to arrive at the payment plan amount.
      (4)   The payment plan amount is due each of the following three (fourth,
fifth, and sixth) months (“payment plan period”), on the same date as and in
addition to, the current water and sewer bill for those months.
      (5)   If any payment plan amount or current payment amount is not timely
made during the payment plan period, the Village can terminate water service on
the business day following the due date of the payment, unless full payment is
made of all unpaid amounts plus the reconnection fee.
      (6)   The owner or occupant of any one property can enter into a payment
plan under this subsection (e) only two times per year.
   (f)   Delinquent water and sewer bills that remain unpaid more than thirty
(30) calendar days and are not the subject of a pending payment plan shall be
subject to collection as follows:
      (1)   If the bill has arisen pursuant to a service contract made directly
with an owner who occupies the property served, the Village Administrator may
certify such fact along with the bill to the County Auditor to be placed on the
real property tax list and duplicate in accordance with Ohio R.C. 735.29(A).
      (2)   The Village Administrator may cause collection action to be taken
including, but not limited to, instituting action at law in the name of the
Village against an owner, occupant and/or other person who is liable to pay the
bills. (Ord. 19-005. Passed 3-18-19.)
921.07 DISCONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Once all or a portion of two consecutive months’ water bills have
become delinquent, if the bills are not paid in full by the first business day
of the following month, a delinquency notice will be hung on the door of the
property for which water and sewer services are billed. At that time, a
delinquency will result in termination of water services to the property,
according to the procedure set forth in this Section 927.07.
   The notice will include the shut off bill and a letter stating that, to
avoid disconnection, the full amount of the shut off bill must be paid on or
before to the 15th day of the month that the notice is given, or if the 15th
day of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, that the full amount of the
shut off bill must be paid on or before the first business day following the
15th day of the month the notice is given.
   If the property is a residence, the notice shall also be given to the owner
of the property (“owner”), and both owner and occupant shall be given an
opportunity to request a hearing on such termination within ten days of the
mailing and hanging of the notice. If either the owner or occupant requests a
hearing, service cannot be terminated until after such hearing. If water
service is in the name of the owner, the occupant may, at or before such
hearing, transfer the account into the name of the occupant upon paying any
unpaid water bills on any account already in the name of the occupant, paying a
new security deposit, and establishing a new account. The notice described in
this subsection shall be hung on the door of the property and sent by ordinary
mail to the last known address of the owner, if such address is other than that
of the property subject to disconnection. The owner/occupant and the Village
Administrator have the opportunity to mutually reach a satisfactory agreement
to avoid termination of service but only up to the date of termination.
   (b)   Disconnection of service shall be done on the next business day
following the date on the notice for payment of the shut off amount. If a
hearing described in subsection (a) above, has been requested within ten days
of the posting and mailing of the notice but has not yet been held,
disconnection shall be postponed until the business day following the hearing.
In order to preclude service being terminated over a weekend, disconnections
shall not be made on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays.
   (c)   The Village shall not disconnect service to the home of any customer
during such time as any resident therein is seriously ill, as certified to the
Village Administrator by a registered physician. A registered physician’s
certification of serious illness shall be sufficient if initially made by
telephone. In such an event the Village Administrator shall inform the
certifying physician that he or she must forward to the Administrator within
seven (7) days, a written certification indicating the name and address of the
seriously ill person, the nature of the illness, and its likely duration. Upon
receipt of this notice, the Administrator shall forward an installment note,
payable upon demand, evidencing the full amount of the unpaid bill, which must
be returned with the customer’s signature within ten (10) days in order for
this section to be applicable. Collection upon the note can be made by the
Village at any time. Serious illness affects disconnection only. It has no
effect on necessity to pay by the customer or collection by the Village.
   (d)   If the Administrator sends an employee to the customer’s premises for
the purpose of disconnecting service, and the customer then and there tenders
payment in full of the bill to prevent disconnection, the service shall not be
disconnected; provided, however, that the Administrator may charge such
customer twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for sending such employee to the
premises, which amount must also be paid to prevent disconnection. This
disconnection fee shall also be charged to any account for which service has
been disconnected. For purposes of this section, the utility’s field personnel
and employees shall be deemed to be authorized and shall be required to accept
full payment from the customer and give the customer a receipt for any payment
made but shall not be required to make change or to enter into agreements with
the customer. Any employee sent to disconnect service shall bring with him or
her either a copy of the customer’s bill showing the amount outstanding, or all
the information contained therein.
   (e)   Water and sewer bills that remain unpaid for seven (7) calendar days
after service is terminated will result in the customer’s security deposit
being applied to the unpaid bill and the amount closed.
   (f)   Water service that has been terminated will not be restored until any
unpaid balance for water and sewer service and the $25.00 disconnection fee has
been paid in full. Water service that has been terminated and the account
closed will not be restored to the property until any unpaid balance for water
and sewer service is paid in full, a new account established, a new security
deposit made and water service restoration fee paid. This procedure will apply
to the property whether occupied by the same occupant as when service was
terminated, a new occupant or owner.
   (g)   If a customer disputes any part of an original or delinquent bill as
rendered, he or she shall notify the Fiscal Officer in writing within three
business days after receipt of the bill. The Fiscal Officer shall promptly
notify the Village Administrator who shall investigate the dispute promptly and
thoroughly and make a diligent attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory
settlement of the dispute. If a mutually satisfactory settlement is not
reached, the customer will be so informed in writing and shall also be informed
in writing of his or her right to appeal to Council in accordance with Section

the manner set forth herein.
   (b)    Upon determination by the Village Administrator of the existence of
the following conditions, the Village Administrator shall take the following
actions:
      (1)    Level 1 Water Alert. When moderate but declining supplies of water
are available and/or mild strains are placed on the distribution capabilities
of the Village water supply system, the Village Administrator shall, through
appropriate means, call upon the general population to employ prudent restraint
in water usage, and to conserve water voluntarily by whatever methods are
available.
      (2)    Level 2 Water Alert. When limited supplies of water are available
and/or moderate strains are placed on the distribution capabilities of the
Village water supply system, the Village Administrator shall, through
appropriate means, institute mandatory water conservation measures, including
the following:
         A.    The watering or irrigation of lawns, shrubbery, trees, grass,
plants, gardens or any other vegetation may only occur at an even numbered

date system as described in the Level 2 Water Alert;
            2.    Greenhouse or nursery stocks;
            3.    Watering by commercial nurseries of freshly planted
vegetation.
         B.    The washing of residential and individual mobile equipment,
except:
            1.    Commercial enterprises for washing motor vehicles for the
public, whereby persons pay a charge or fee for each vehicle washed, shall not
be restricted in operation, provided such facilities of the enterprise have a
water recycling system approved by the Village Administrator. Each such
facility or washing location shall post a conspicuous sign so identifying the
use of a recycling process. Where there is not installed or in operation a
recycling process, each such facility or location shall operate or be open to
the public only during hours so determined by the Village Administrator.
         C.    The washing of streets, driveways, parking lots, sidewalks,
exterior of homes, apartments and office building or other outdoor surfaces by
residential, commercial or institutional customers.
         D.    The operation of any ornamental fountains or other structure
making a similar use of water.

fire suppression or public emergency.
         F.    The filling of swimming pools or the refilling of swimming pools
which were drained after the effective date of the order. Normal requirements
to maintain operating levels within swimming pools will be permitted; such
normal requirements being attributed to replacement of water lost because of
evaporation or overflow resulting from, or caused by use.
      (5)    Level 5 Water Alert. When critically limited supplies of water are
available and/or critical strains are placed on the distribution capabilities
of the Village water supply system, the Village Administrator may institute
mandatory reductions on each customer, including but not limited to rate
penalties for exceeding specified water allotments; provided, however, any plan
proposed under this Water Alert Level must be submitted to and approved by
Council.
      (6)    Level 6 Water Alert. When crucial supplies of water are available
and/or extremely critical strains are placed on the distribution capabilities
of the Village water supply system, the Village Administrator shall restrict
the use of water to purposes which are absolutely essential to life, health and
safety.
   (c)   A second or third violation of this section shall be a minor
misdemeanor.
   (d)   Penalties for violation of any of the measures provided for under this
section shall be:

19-15.)
921.15 BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Village Administrator, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water system, the
Village Administrator will give notice to the water consumer to install such an
approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the
Village Administrator and shall have inspections and tests made of such
approved devices as required by the Village Administrator.
   (b)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the Village of Utica may enter the supply or distributing
system of said Municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water
supply and the method of connection and use of such water supply shall have
been approved by the Village Administrator and by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency.
   (c)   It shall be the duty of the Village Administrator to cause surveys and
investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated as often as the Village Administrator shall
deem necessary.
   (d)   The Village Administrator or said Administrator’s duly authorized
representative shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system of the Village for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or
systems thereof. On demand, the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so
served shall furnish to the Village Administrator any information which the
Village Administrator may request regarding the piping system or systems or
water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when demanded,
shall, within the discretion of the Village Administrator, be deemed evidence
of the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Village Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains. Water services to such property shall not be
restored until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this section.
   (f)   The water consumer shall, on any premises on which any containment
principle backflow preventer required by rules 3745-95-04 and 3745-95-05 of the
Ohio Administrative Code (“device”) is installed, have thorough inspections and
operational tests made to the backflow preventers at the time of installation
or repair, and as may be reasonably required by the Village Administrator and
or Utilities Superintendent, but in all cases at least once every twelve
months. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water
consumer and shall be performed by a person qualified to inspect and test
backflow preventers.
      (1)   These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the
expense of the consumer whenever they are found to be defective.
      (2)   Records of such inspections, tests, repairs and overhaul shall be
kept by the water consumer and submitted on the proper form to the Village of
Utica within 10 days of the inspections tests, repairs and/or overhaul, but no

929.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (a)   Authority. This chapter is adopted under the authority granted by Ohio
R.C. 715.40 and 3707.42.
   (b)   Title. This chapter shall be known as, referred to, or cited as the
“User Charge and Sewer Use Ordinance for the Village of Utica, Ohio,” and
hereinafter referred to as this chapter.
   (c)   Findings and Declaration of Policy. Council hereby finds that the
requirements for the issuance of Federal grants and the acceptance of such
grants by the Village under Title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
as amended, (Public Law 95-217, of the Clean Water Act of 1977) and the
regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as promulgated in the
May 12, 1982, Federal Register, Volume 47, Number 92, Part II, for the
construction of waste treatment works to improve the quality of effluent
discharges from the Village establish:
      (1)   The necessity of adopting a user charge system that would be
proportionate to all classes of users and produce the revenue required to
sustain the sewage collection and waste treatment system;
      (2)   The necessity of enacting regulations that control the use and
inflow into waste treatment works.
   (d)   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the
public health, safety, prosperity, aesthetics and general welfare of the
citizens of the Village and is designed to provide the legislative enactments
required under Public Law 95-217, and applicable Federal regulations for the
acceptance of construction grants to improve the quality of effluent discharges
from waste treatment works. It is further intended to provide for
administration and enforcement of this chapter and to provide penalties for its
violations.
   (e)   Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the Village shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other power granted by the statutes of the State.
   (f)   Severability. If any section, provision or portion of this chapter is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of the chapter shall not be affected thereby.
   (g)   Repeal. All other ordinances or parts of ordinances of the Village
inconsistent or conflicting with this chapter, to the extent of the
inconsistency only, are hereby repealed.
   (h)   Effective Date. This chapter shall become effective January 1, 1985,
after adoption by Council and publication or posting as provided by law.
(Ord. 84-14. Passed 6-4-84.)
929.02 REVENUES.
   (a)   Establishment of Revenue System. A user charge shall be assessed to
all users, according to their classifications, by the Village in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter. The Village may, under applicable statutes
of the State and Village ordinances, levy ad valorem taxes for general
obligation bond principal and interest payments and any other purpose provided
by law not related to the operation, maintenance and replacement of the works
of the system.
   (b)   User Charge System.
      (1)   User classes. Each user shall be classified as residential,
commercial, industrial, institutional or governmental in accordance with the
definitions in Section
929.07  for each class.
      (2)   Budget and appropriation. The Village Administrator shall annually
prepare an estimate of anticipated costs for each category or user charge, as
outlined hereafter, for the forthcoming fiscal year. These estimates shall be
made in the form of a rate ordinance and shall be proposed to Council for
enactment in the manner provided by the Ohio Revised Code. Any change in user
charges shall maintain proportionality among user classes. (Ord. 84-14. Passed
6-4-84.)
      (3)   Operation, maintenance and replacement charges. The unit charges
for operation, maintenance and replacement shall be determined as follows:
         A.   The estimated annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs
shall be apportioned to treatment, conveyance, collection and billing. The
costs associated with billing shall be separated from all other O, M and R
costs and charged to users according to subsection (b)(5) hereof.
         B.   The annual O, M and R costs for treatment, conveyance and
collection shall be divided by the previous year’s total billable flow in 100
cu. ft. (estimated if not available). The unit charge obtained shall be the
basis for user charges to all users of the Village sanitary sewer system. All
users with a billable flow less than 500 cu. ft. per month shall pay a minimum
charge per month. The minimum monthly charge for O, M and R shall be based on
the unit charge obtained above.
         C.   In addition to the unit charge described in subsection (3)B.
above, the Village may establish a per account charge, not to exceed five
dollars ($5.00) per month, for the purpose of paying for operation, maintenance
and replacement costs.
            (Ord. 04-020. Passed 2-14-05.)
      (4)    Extra strength waste charges. For each industrial, commercial,
institutional or governmental user discharging extra strength wastes, a
surcharge for such wastes shall be levied in addition to any other charges
using the following formula:
         Cs =    .00624 [Bc (B-200) + Sc (S-250) 1 Vu
         Where
         Cs =    Surcharge per quarter
         Bc =    Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of a pound of BOD
         B =    Concentration of BOD (mg/l) from user
         Sc =    Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of a pound of
suspended solids.
         S =    Concentration of suspended solids (mg/l) from user
         Vu =    Volume contribution from user in 100 cu. ft. of billable flow
per quarter.
The unit operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of BOD and
suspended solids are obtained by separating the annual operation, maintenance
and replacement costs into the parameters of flow, BOD and SS using the
percentage breakdown of fifty percent (50%) for flow, twenty-five percent (25%)
for BOD and twenty-five percent (25%) for SS. The unit charges for BOD and SS
are obtained by dividing the annual operation, maintenance and replacement cost
for each parameter by the annual billable pounds for each parameter.
      (5)    Billing charges.  A unit handling charge per bill to cover the
cost of billing and collection shall be assessed against each user. The total
administrative and overhead costs associated with billing and collection shall
be determined by the Village Administrator. The unit handling charge is
obtained by dividing the total administrative and overhead costs by the
forthcoming year's estimated total number of bills.
      (6)    Additional charges. Additional charges shall be billed, as
required for the following:
         A.    Actual costs incurred for user-requested samplings and analyses.
         B.    Actual costs incurred for special handling not provided for
elsewhere in this chapter.

to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning by the user and for inspection
by the Village Administrator.
      (2)    Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the user, at his own expense, and shall be kept in continuous and
efficient operation at all times.
      (3)    In the event the Village approves the admission of any materials
into its sewers as set forth in subsection (b)(2) hereof, the Village shall
direct the user causing admission of any such materials to, at his own expense,
construct, install, and operate such preliminary treatment plants and
facilities as may be required in order to:
         A.    Reduce the BOD to 300 parts per million and the suspended solids

regulations, and unless written approval of the plans, specifications,
technical operating data, and sludge disposal has been obtained from Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency and any other local, State or Federal agency
having regulatory authority with respect thereto.
      (5)    All such preliminary treatment facilities as required by this
chapter shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operating condition by the user or person operating and maintaining the
facility served thereby, and at the user's expense.
      (6)    No provision contained in this chapter shall be construed to
prevent or prohibit a separate or special contract or agreement between the
Village and any industrial user whereby industrial waste and material of
unusual strength, character or composition may be accepted by the Village for
treatment, subject to additional payment therefor by the industrial user;
provided, however, that such contract or agreement shall have the prior
approval of Council.
      (7)    The Village reserves the right to reject admission to the system
of any waste harmful to the treatment or collection facilities or to the
receiving stream.
   (d)    Discharge Permits.
      (1)    The Village reserves the right to require a discharge permit from
commercial or industrial users of the sewer, and, if the Village does exercise
the option, commercial or industrial users shall not discharge to a sewer
system, without having first applied for and obtained a permit from the Village
Administrator. Upon official notification from the Administrator, each
commercial or industrial user presently discharging material to the sewer shall
apply for and obtain such a discharge permit within ninety days from the date
of such notification.
      (2)    Commercial and industrial classification codes set forth in the
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972 Edition, as amended and

provided for that purpose by the Administrator and shall be fully completed
under oath by the property owner, user or a duly authorized and knowledgeable
officer, agent or representative thereof, and acknowledged. If requested, the
person making application shall also submit such scientific or testing data, or
other information as may be required by the Administrator. The Administrator
shall also have, at his discretion, the right to personally inspect the
premises, equipment and material and laboratory testing facilities of the
applicant.
      (4)    No fee shall be charged for a discharge application or permit,
unless the Administrator will incur costs to have the application reviewed by a
private firm. The Administrator will then charge fees to cover such costs.
      (5)    No discharge permit shall be issued by the Administrator to any
person whose discharge of material to sewers, whether shown upon the
application to determine after inspection and testing conducted by the
Administrator, is not in conformance with Federal, State or Village statutes,
ordinances, rules and regulations, unless a waiver or variance of such
standards and requirements is granted by the Administrator in the manner
hereinafter set forth. The Administrator shall state in writing the reason or
reasons for denial or requirement for waiver-variance and such written
communication shall be mailed or personally delivered to the applicant within
five days after denial.
      (6)    In the event the type or volume of material from property for
which a discharge permit was previously granted shall materially and
substantially change, the person granted such permit previously, shall make a
new application to the Administrator in the same manner and form as originally
made.
      (7)    If the application for a new permit or for one because of change
in the type or volume of material discharge is denied by the Administrator, or
if the discharge indicated from the permit application or inspection is not in
accordance with the requirements of subsection (d)(5) hereof, and a waiver or
variance is required, the user may have the Administrator review the denial or
may request waiver-variance, provided the user shall give written notice of his
request within thirty days after receiving the denial. The Administrator shall
review the permit application, the written denial, and such other evidence and
matters as the applicant and the Administrator shall present at its next
regular meeting following receipt of request for its review, and the decision
of the Administrator rendered publicly at such meeting shall be final.
      (8)    In the event that any discharge of material to a sewer shall
materially and substantially differ in type and volume than shown in the
application and permit, the person and user shall immediately, upon order of
the Administrator, cease and desist from such discharge and shall also be
subject to disconnection, fine and other penalties provided by this chapter.
      (9)    A grant of waiver or variance by the Administrator may set forth
such conditions, exceptions, time limitations, durations, and expirations as
the Administrator deems necessary and proper.
   (e)    Reporting Criteria for Nonresidential Users.
      (1)    The Village reserves the right to require any nonresidential user
to submit quarterly to the Village Administrator on forms provided by the
Village, a certified statement of the characteristics of its industrial wastes
discharged in the sewers and treatment works of the Village or to any sewers
connected to its treatment works. This statement shall be filed with the
Village Administrator no later than the tenth day of the month following the
quarter for which the report is required.
      (2)    The waste characteristics to be measured and certified by the user
shall be:
         A.   BOD in milligrams per liter.
         B.   Suspended solids in milligrams per liter.
         C.   Such other constituents of wastewater as directed by the Village
Administrator.
      (3)    Should there be a difference in understanding between the
Administrator and user as to the characteristics in subsection (e) hereof, the
Administrator reserves the right to use his results from analyses for purpose
of billing. Should submission not be made during the ten day period, the
Administrator shall use his results from analyses for purposes of billing.
      (4)    Whenever required by the Administrator, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying nonresidential wastewater and material
shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber in the building sewer in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Administrator and
installed and maintained at all times at the user's expense. There shall be
ample room in each sampling chamber to accurately sample and composite samples
for analysis. The chamber shall be safely, easily and independently (of other
premises and buildings of user) accessible to authorized representatives of the
Administrator at all times. Where construction of a sampling chamber is not
economically or otherwise feasible, alternate arrangements for sampling may be
arranged at the discretion of the Administrator.
      (5)    Each sampling chamber shall contain a Parshall flume, weir, or
similar device with a recording and totalizing register for measuring liquid
quantity; or the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as a
measure of liquid quantity where it is substantiated by the Administrator that
the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same or
where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the Administrator is made in the
metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity.
      (6)    Samples shall be taken every hour or half hour, as determined by
the Administrator, and properly refrigerated and composited in proportion to
the flow for a representative twenty-four hour sample. Such sampling shall be
done as prescribed by the Administrator to insure representative quantities for
the entire reporting period. Minimum requirements for determination of
representative quantities or characteristics shall include reevaluation during
each twelve month period. The determination of representative quantities and
characteristics shall include not less than seven consecutive calendar days of
twenty-four hour composite samplings taken during periods of normal operation,
together with acceptable flow measurements.
      (7)    The sampling frequency, sampling chamber, metering device,
sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any time, to
inspection and verification by the Administrator.
      (8)    All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this section shall be
determined in accordance with the standard methods specified in Section
929.07 (57) or with any other method approved by the Administrator.
      (9)    The Administrator may elect, at his option, to have the metering
and sample collection done by the industrial plant personnel and have composite
samples delivered to the Village wastewater treatment laboratory for analysis.
This procedure can also be terminated at any time by the Administrator upon
reasonable notice.
   (f)    Private Sewage Treatment and Disposal.
      (1)    Where a public sewer is not available, as set forth in subsection
(a) hereof, the building or structure shall be connected to a private sewer,
and a disposal or treatment system shall be constructed in compliance with the
terms and provisions of all applicable City, County, State and Federal laws and
regulations.
      (2)    Within ninety days after a property served by a private sewer or
disposal system as described in this section shall become subject to the terms
and provisions of subsection (a)(7), a direct connection shall be made to the
public sewer according to the terms and provisions of this chapter, and all
private sewers, disposal systems, septic tanks, cesspools, and other
appurtenances of such private sewer and disposal system shall be disconnected
and abandoned and all openings, tanks, or other containers of human wastes,
garbage and other wastes shall be permanently filled with granular material.
      (3)    The Village shall not be responsible in any way for the operation
and maintenance of a private sewer or disposal system or facility.
      (4)    No provisions of this chapter shall be construed to provide lesser
requirements for private sewers and disposal systems as are presently or may
hereafter be imposed and required by any other local governmental body or the
State or Federal government.
   (g)    Service to Outlying Territory.
      (1)    The Village, by proper resolution of Council, shall have the right
at its discretion, upon payments, terms and conditions as may be mutually
agreed upon, to contract in writing for the right to use any sewer serving
property located wholly or partly outside the Village's corporate limits.
      (2)    In the event a contract is made pursuant to subsection (g)(1)
hereof, a user of any sewer serving property wholly or partly outside the
Village's corporate limits shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions
of this chapter, and in addition to all payments and charges, be required to
pay all equivalent costs, taxes, charges and expenses as would be imposed upon
and paid by a user situated within the corporate limits of the Village.
      (3)    If any property of a person desirous of becoming a user is
situated outside the corporate limits of the Village, the Village at its
discretion may permit such a connection, provided that a contract providing
essentially the following be entered into between the Village and the user:
         A.    The user may connect buildings situated only on the fully-
described tract or area set forth in the agreement and in accordance with all
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations of the Village and local, State and
Federal governments.
         B.    The wastes and material discharged shall meet all present and
future standards for content and volume, and the user shall further agree to
pay all future connections, user, and treatment or service charges which are
applicable to all property and users uniformly.
         C.   The user shall, in addition to costs noted previously, pay debt
service charges as established by the Village Administrator, if applicable.
         D.   If the user, or any successor or assigns thereof, shall fail to
pay the charges when due, each and every sewer upon the property, or any
subdivided tract thereof, for which payment is not made shall be disconnected
by the owner from any other sewer which was connected under the contact and
ultimately attached to the Village treatment plant. The user shall have caused
or required its sewer system to be constructed within the property in order
that separate tracts may be so disconnected. By tapping into the Village
sanitary sewer system, the user for himself and his heirs, successors and
assigns, forever, shall be deemed to have given and granted the Village an
irrevocable easement for the purpose of going upon his land and disconnecting
any such sewer if the producer, its successors or assigns, fail to disconnect
promptly when such is required.
         E.   In addition to the right of disconnection, the Village shall have
the right to file a civil suit to collect such amounts as are delinquent and
due against the user, the full cost incurred in disconnection, and all its
reasonable legal expenses and attorney’s fees incurred as a result of the suit.
         F.   All amounts charged under subsection (g)(3) are due and shall
continue to be due hereunder, whether or not such sewer is disconnected, and no
sewer shall be reconnected until the Village is paid in full for all amounts
due it.
   G.   The Village shall not, without its prior written consent and
acceptance, have dedicated to it, or own, any sewer system installed within the
property, and the producer, its successors and assigns, shall maintain the same
at its own cost; provided, however, that this provision shall not be construed
to prohibit the dedication of part or all of such sewer system to another unit
of government.
         H.   Upon conveyance by the owner of all or any subdivided portion or
tract of the property, the successor in title shall succeed to all rights and
liabilities hereunder, and such owner shall have no future liability to the
Village thereunder in respect to such tract except as shall have accrued as of
the date the instrument of conveyance is recorded in the office of the Recorder
of Licking or Knox County, State of Ohio.
         I.   In the event that such property therein described, or any
subdivided or separate tract thereof, shall be annexed to the Village by proper
ordinance, then the agreement executed pursuant to subsection (g)(3) hereof, as
to such property or the subdivided or separate tract thereof which is so
annexed, shall then terminate and be of no further force and effect.
         J.   The agreement executed under subsection (g)(3) hereof shall be
recorded and filed with the Fiscal Officer, which recording shall constitute
notice to any successor or assign of the owner of its terms and provisions and
to which any subsequent conveyance or assignment of the owner shall be subject.
         K.   If any part or provision of the agreement shall be found or held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then the
entire agreement shall terminate and all sewers of the owner or its successors
or assigns shall be promptly disconnected from any such system which ultimately
connects to the Village treatment plant.
         L.   The applicant for treatment service under an agreement pursuant
to subsection (g)(3), shall agree to assume user charges, industrial waste
charges, and debt service charges, if applicable, and to obtain from the
Village the proper building permit by which the connection is allowed and the
discharge permit, if applicable, which indicates what discharge will be made to
the treatment system.
   (h)   Septic Haulers.
      (1)   Nonindustrial users hauling liquid wastes to the treatment plant
shall be assessed user charge unit charges for billable flow and extra strength
waste charges, if applicable, all of which are to be determined by the Village
Administrator.
      (2)   Industrial users hauling liquid wastes to the treatment plant shall
be assessed user charges as described in subsection (h)(1).
      (3)   Liquid wastes hauled to the treatment plant containing
concentrations of constituents in excess of the limits set forth in subsection
(b) hereof shall not be accepted.
   (i)   Construction of Sewers and Connections for Buildings.
      (1)   No unauthorized person shall make connections with any public sewer
or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the
Village Administrator.
      (2)   Application for a permit shall be signed by the owner, lessee or
agent of the property for which the connection is desired and by the person
employed to perform the work, and must describe the property and state the
purpose for which the connection is desired. All applications filed shall be
accompanied by a tap-on fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) payable to the
Village. Applications shall be filed with the Fiscal Officer upon a form to be
supplied by the Village.
      (3)   The owner shall be responsible for making connection to the Village
sanitary sewer system. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and
connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the Village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly
be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
      (4)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
      (5)    Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the Village Administrator
to meet all requirements of this chapter.
      (6)    The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a
building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
jointing, testing and backfilling the trench shall be as follows:
         A.    Size. The minimum size for any building sewer shall be four
inches inside diameter.
         B.    Grade. The building sewer shall be laid on a straight, uniform
and minimum grade of one percent (1%).
         C.    Materials. The pipe and joints for any building sewer shall be
manufactured of either unplasticized, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic meeting
the requirements of ASTM Specification 03034, latest revisions, or other pipe
material approved by the Village Administrator.
         D.    Excavation.
            1.    Except in rock, water-bearing earth, or where a granular or
concrete base is to be used, mechanical excavation of trenches shall be stopped
above the final invert grade elevations so that the pipe may be laid on a firm,
undisturbed, native earth bed. If overdigging occurs, all loosened earth must
be moved and the trench bottom brought back to grade with granular material.
            2.    All sewers shall be constructed on firm foundations and the
sewer builder shall use such construction methods as may be necessary to
prevent settlement of the pipe after it is laid. If, in the opinion of the
Village Administrator, the material encountered at the bottom of the trench at
the grade of the sewer is unsuitable for foundation, the sewer builder shall
excavate to such further depth or width, or shall take such other steps as may
be directed by the Village Administrator, to provide a good foundation.
Authorized excavation below grade shall be filled with suitable material as
directed by the Village Administrator.
            3.   The bottom of the trench shall be carefully graded, shaped and
tamped to conform to the outside circumference of the pipe before any pipe is
laid. Bell holes, if bell and spigot pipe is used, shall be ample size to
permit joints to be made but shall not unduly encroach upon the bottom bearing
for the pipe barrel. All rock or stones protruding above the prepared bed of
the pipe shall be removed so that in no case will rock touch pipe either along
the barrel or in bell holes. Onto this prepared bed, the pipe shall be
carefully bedded and checked for line and grade.
         E.    Pipe placement.
            1.    The laying of pipe in finished trenches shall be commenced at
the lowest point, with the spigot ends pointing in the direction of flow.
            2.    Preparatory to making pipe joints, all surfaces of the
portions of the pipes to be jointed, or of the factory-made jointing material
shall be clean and dry. Lubricants, primers, adhesives, etc. shall be used as
recommended by the pipe or joint manufacturers’
specifications. The jointing materials or factory-fabricated joints shall then
be placed, fitted, joined and adjusted in such a workmanlike manner as to
obtain the degree of watertightness required. Trenches shall be kept waterfree
and as dry as possible during bedding, laying and jointing for as long a period
as required.
         F.    Backfilling.
            1.    After the sewer pipe has been laid and the joint completed,
care shall be taken in subsequent operations to maintain the pipe to line and
grade and to prevent movement. Backfilling operations shall be so conducted as
to insure against such movement.
            2.    Sand, crusher run stone, grits, bank run sand and gravel, or
selected trench excavation, if approved by the Village Administrator, shall be
hand-placed and tamped along the sides of the pipe and worked under the sides
of the pipe without "lifting" the pipe or causing other movement which will
break the joint or cause the pipe to move off alignment. The foregoing
described selected material shall be used as backfill around the pipe up to the
spring line, halfway up the pipe. Select earth backfill shall then be placed
along the sides of the pipe and thoroughly tamped in six inch layers until the
top of the pipe is covered with six inches of select tamped material.
Mechanical or other means of accomplishing the balance of the backfill may be
used then for filling the remainder of the trench.
            3.    The trenches and other excavation shall be backfilled with
the best of excavated material, in such a manner as will insure the least
possible settlement, The backfill and removing of the surplus materials shall
follow immediately on the satisfactory laying of the pipe.
         G.    Testing.
            1.    A test shall be required to demonstrate the watertightness of
the building sewer and shall be made under the supervision and direction of the
Village Administrator. The sewer builder shall furnish all labor, equipment and
materials required in connection therewith.
            2.    If the exfiltration test is used, the sewer lateral shall be
closed with water until the water elevation in the upstream end of the sewer is
not less than four feet above the invert of the sewer pipe or four feet above
the ground water elevation in the trench, whichever is higher. The exfiltration
will be determined by measuring the amount of water required to maintain the
above-stated water elevation for a period of one hour from the start of the
test. The entire length of section to be tested shall be full of water for a
period of approximately twenty-four hours prior to the start of the test.
            3.    The amount of exfiltration shall not exceed a rate of 200
gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of sewer in each and every
section tested.
            4.    If the low-pressure air test is used for testing, the testing
procedure shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Spec. C828-75T or the
latest revision. Test pressure shall be from 3-1/2 p.s.i. to 2-1/2 p.s.i. with
allowable air loss of 0.003 cubic feet per minute per square feet of internal
pipe surface. All safety precautions as required by ASTM C828 shall be followed
when conducting the air test.
            5.    If the test results do not come to within the limits
specified, such work as may be necessary in order to insure conformance, even
to the extent of reconstructing the defective section or sections, will be
required.
      (7)    The building sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation to permit gravity flow to the public sewer. In buildings in which the
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means at
the owner's expense and discharged to the building sewer.
      (8)    The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
be made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.
If the public sewer is twelve inches in diameter or less, and no properly
located "Y" branch is available, a "Y" branch or saddle shall be installed in
the public sewer at the location specified by the Village Administrator. Where
the public sewer is greater than twelve inches in diameter, and no properly
located "Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer
to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an
angle of about forty-five degrees (45°). A forty-five degree (45°) ell may be
used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past
the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the
point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the
invert of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made, and the
connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. All such
connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Special fittings may be used
for the connection only when approved by the Village Administrator. The cost of
installing the connection shall be included in the owner's tap-on fee.
      (9)    The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Village Administrator when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Village Administrator.
      (10)    All excavations for building sewer installation shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in
the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the
Village. (Ord. 84-14. Passed 6-4-84.)

1313.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Utica, Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Utica has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Utica as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the Village of Utica.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective May 2, 2007.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Utica as required by Section
1313.04 (c), Subdivisions and Major Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 39 Spring Street Utica, Ohio 43080.
      (4)   In addition, these regulations shall apply to Future Condition
Flood Hazard Areas determined through FEMA approved certified engineering
analysis. Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas may be determined in the FIRM
and FIS, or per Section
1313.04 (c) of these regulations.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Utica, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 07-004. Passed 3-12-07.)
1313.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      (1)   “Accessory Structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      (2)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain
Administrator's interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a
request for a variance.
      (3)   “Base Flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be
referred to as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or 100 year flood.
      (4)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from l to 3 feet).
      (5)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (6)   “Best Available Data” means any data provided by a federal or State
agency or professional engineer registered in the State of Ohio in accordance
with FEMA approved certified engineering analysis. Base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood maps and studies shall take
precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other
source that reflect a reduced floodway and or lower base flood elevation. Other
sources of data showing increased base flood elevations and or larger floodway
areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps and studies, shall be reasonably
utilized by the Floodplain Administrator.

designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse. SFHA
that has been delineated through FEMA approved engineering practices in
accordance with Section
1313.04 (c), Subdivisions and Major Developments, shall also be considered
SFHA.

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Utica's flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1313.01 (f) accurately present flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard

Utica boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Utica suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the Village of Utica has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1313.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations and delineates
floodway limits for all subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
containing at least fifty lots or five acres, whichever is less.
      (5)   The applicant shall meet the requirement to submit technical data
to FEMA in Section
1313.03 (j)(1)A.4. when a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis is completed that
generates base flood elevations as required by subsection (c)(4) hereof.
      (6)   All platted subdivision and major development proposals, including
manufactured home subdivisions and/or parks, shall not include any area
identified as special flood hazard areas upon a lot within said plat, unless
that lot contains more than two acres outside of the flood hazard areas
exclusive of road right-of-ways or other easements of record. Special flood
hazard areas shall be designated as permanent open space unless otherwise
specified by LCPC.
      (7)   For developments occurring adjacent to or near any stream or body
of water not identified by the FIRM, including intermittent streams, the
developer shall determine the 100-year base flood elevations through a
certified engineering analysis. These elevations shall be determined in
accordance with FEMA approved certified engineering analysis by a Registered
Professional Engineer.
      (8)   Where base flood elevation data are utilized within areas of
special flood hazard the following provisions apply:
         A.   Special Flood Hazard Areas. The approval of subdivisions and
major development that is located in or partially in an area of periodic
flooding, or identified as a special flood hazard area shall be limited to the
following:
            1.   Approval shall not be given for streets within a subdivision,

delineation of special flood hazard areas, and such flood prone areas shall be
left undeveloped as open space, recreation areas, etc. No area where natural
elevation is shown as flood prone shall be used for building sites, leach
fields, well sites, or required yard or lot area. These requirements shall be
included in the covenants and deed restrictions on the final plat and
individual lot deed. If the special flood hazard area (or floodway) designation
is disputed, the developer must demonstrate where the FIRM is inaccurate
through an engineering analysis that is accepted by FEMA, according to their
flood map amendment procedures. All central sanitary sewer systems and water
supply systems must either be located outside the special flood hazard areas,
or they must be floodproofed.
         C.   Additional permits may be required for sanitary and septic
systems from the LCPC, Licking County Health Department, Licking County Water
and Wastewater Department, and/or local water and sewer district, and other
agencies.
         D.   Stream, Drainage, Flood Easements, and Stream Bank Buffers. If a
stream flows through, or is adjacent to, the proposed subdivisions and/or major
developments, the subdivider/developer shall provide for a storm water easement
and streambank buffer along the stream(s).
            1.   Access to streams or storm drainage ditches and channels shall

on the preliminary plan and the final plat within identified flood hazard
areas. The buffer area can be located on lots if the lot provides more than two
acres of useable ground outside of the buffer. The buffer area shall be
maintained in its natural or scenic condition to provide water quality
protection and flood buffering, and shall have these conditions incorporated
into the deed restrictions and covenants.
            4.   Whenever a storm drainage ditch or channel has a depth of
three feet or more, a slope of two foot horizontal to one foot vertical shall
be provided.
            5.   Public Access. Floodplain, storm water easements, and
streambank buffers established under these regulations shall provide for public
access for inspection and enforcement of these regulations, and the regulations
adopted by local, state, and federal regulations. The establishment of these
easements and buffers does not in itself provide for public maintenance of
these facilities.
            6.   Stream bank buffers include:
               a.   A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining
an area of greater than 20 square miles.

an area of greater than 0.05 square miles (32 acres) and up to 0.5 square miles
(320 acres).
               d.   A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining
an area of less than .05 square miles (32 acres).
               e.   Where the special flood hazard area (base flood area, or
100 year floodplain, or one percent (1%) annual chance floodplain) is wider
than the stream bank buffer on either or both sides of the stream as prescribed
above, stream bank buffer shall be extended to the outer edge of the special
flood hazard area (base flood area, or 100 year floodplain, or one percent (1%)
annual chance floodplain).
   (d)   Residential Structures.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1313.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Utica and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
         C.   Prohibit dredging, mining, excavation, or similar activities
unless a technical evaluation by a registered professional engineer certifies
there will be no increase in erosion, sedimentation, or turbidity upstream or
downstream of the site.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 0.01 foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible,
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. Watercourses are not to be altered,
including enclosed (piped), unless no practicable alternative exists. For the
purpose of these regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs
within its banks. The extent of the banks shall be established by a field
determination of the "bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull
stage" shall be based on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the “USDA Forest
Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An
Illustrated Guide to Field Technique” or other applicable publication available
from a federal, state, or other authoritative source. For all proposed
developments that alter a watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development; and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Utica specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1313.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
      (4)   Development in riverine areas without base flood elevations or
floodways. Where base flood elevation and floodway boundaries cannot be
determined using other sources of data, the applicant shall determine the base
flood elevation (and floodway limits if necessary) through hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analysis. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
performed only by a registered professional engineer, who shall demonstrate
that the technical methods used correctly reflects standard engineering
practices, and meets FEMA approved certified engineering analysis requirements.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Licking County Planning Commission,
or other agency/persons deemed appropriate. Please see the Planning Commission
on the specifics or for examples of the study required.
   (j)   Streambank Buffer Protection Area. The Stream Bank Buffer Area located
within the delineated 100-year floodplain areas shall be kept in a natural or
scenic condition. Existing bushes, groundcover, shrubs, and trees are not
permitted to be removed from the buffer except to maintain the ecological
health of the forest, to create access to the watercourse, or for the
construction or maintenance of permitted uses such as:
      (1)   Passive recreational uses such as hiking, biking, horseback riding,
hunting, fishing, etc.
      (2)   The installation of Conservation Best Management Practices that
will protect the public health, safety, and welfare along with the environment.
      (3)   Access for compatible public recreational facilities, such as
fishing piers, canoe launches, and all other similar structures, that shall be
perpendicular to the streambank buffer.
      (4)   Storm water outfall, provided such lines are combined where
appropriate, construction activity is minimized, and the buffer is restored to
its preconstruction state.
      (5)   Underground utility crossings, provided such crossings are combined
where appropriate, construction activity is minimized, and the buffer is
restored to its pre-construction state.
      (6)   Additional stream crossings, provided such crossings are combined
where appropriate, construction activity is minimized, and the buffer is
restored to its pre-construction state.
   (k)   Placement of Fill in the Special Flood Hazard Area. Any fill placed
within the floodplain fringe area of the Special Flood Hazard Area shall cause
no rise greater than .01 feet on the site of the fill or adjacent areas. Fill
placed within the Special Flood Hazard Area shall be compacted to current
accepted engineering practices and standards to reduce the occurrence of
erosion or scouring of the fill material from the fill area. Fill sites upon
which structures will be constructed or placed shall be compacted to ninety-
five percent (95%) of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard Proctor
Test method or an accepted equivalent method as approved by Licking County.

Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a
notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         L.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.

substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest

part of the record for appeal.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.

      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

1325.01 SCOPE.
   The Code is limited to the establishment of minimum standards for the
maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning units of all
structures, buildings, and uses within the Village, including lot and yard
areas within the Village. No provisions of this Code shall, in any way,
directly or indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right
of, any owners or residents to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in
such a manner and form as they may determine appropriate; consistent with other
applicable provisions of law. This Code is directed to obvious exterior visual
conditions which may lead to the violation of this code within the Village.
(Ord. 16-022. Passed 8-15-16.)
1325.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Code is to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare by establishing a minimum standard governing the maintenance,
appearance, and exterior condition of all premises and uses throughout the
Village; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents, and
managers of the same as to both separate and correlative responsibilities and
duties; to authorize and establish procedures for the exterior inspection of
such premises and uses; to affix penalties for the violations of this Code; and
to provide a process for the repair, demolition, or vacation of premises unfit
for human habitation, occupancy, or use. This Code is hereby declared to be
remedial and essential for the public interest, and it is intended that this
Code be construed and interpreted to effectuate the purposes at stated herein.
(Ord. 16-022. Passed 8-15-16.)
1325.03 SEVERABILITY.
   Each chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other
divisible part of this Property Maintenance Code is hereby declared to be
severable and if any such chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, clause,
phrase, or other divisible part is declared unconstitutional or otherwise
invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction in a valid judgement or decree,
such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining
chapters, sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases or other divisible
part of this ordinance since the same would have been enacted without the
incorporation into this ordinance of such unconstitutional or invalid chapter,
section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or other divisible part.
(Ord. 16-022. Passed 8-15-16.)
1325.04 APPLICABILITY.
   Every building, residential structure, lot, and yard owner shall comply with
the provisions of this Code, whether or not such building, lot, yard or use
shall have been constructed, altered, or repaired before or after the enactment
of this Code, and without regard to any permits or licenses which shall have
been issued for the use or occupancy of the building premises, for the
construction or repair of the building or use, or for the installation or
repair of equipment or facilities prior to the effective date of this Code.
This Code establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued occupancy
and use of all such structures and properties and does not replace or modify
standards otherwise established for the construction, repair, alteration, or
use of the building. Where there is mixed occupancy, residential, or
nonresidential use shall be regulated by and subject to the provisions of this
Code.
   HISTORIC BUILDINGS: An owner of a building or structure, which has been
designated by a governmental body as having historical significance, may use
that designation as a basis for an appeal from application of the provisions of
this code.
(Ord. 16-022. Passed 8-15-16.)
1325.05 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of the Exterior Property Maintenance Code is
found to be in conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety,
health, or other regulation, the provision of which establishes a higher
standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and health, the
conflicting provision shall prevail.

abated within the time allowed, the Utica Police Department or the Office of
the Village Administrator may cause to have a motor vehicle impounded and all
charges associated with the impound will be the owner's responsibility. (Refer

Vehicle Nuisance).
   
   (d)    When the violation involves a motor vehicle, a copy of the Notice
shall also be conspicuously affixed to the motor vehicle if the surrounding
facts and circumstances make it practicable to do so.
   
   (e)    In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of the
notice of violation and the execution of the failure to comply notice shall
