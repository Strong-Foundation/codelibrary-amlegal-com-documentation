EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Sandusky County Park District Rules
and Regulations into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are based
on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used
in the Ohio Revised Code, and in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
chapter and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the chapter number is 305 (or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 101.08 indicates the code
number is 1, the chapter number is 101 (or the first chapter within code 1),
and the section number is .08.
    This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.

shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
(a)   The repeal of a repealing regulation does not revive the regulation
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
(b)   A regulation which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior regulation and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior regulation.
(ORC 1.54)
(c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a regulation does not, except as
provided in subsection (d) hereof:
(1)   Affect the prior operation of the regulation or any prior action taken
thereunder;
(2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or liability
previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
(3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
(a)   A reference to any portion of the Sandusky County Park District Rules and
Regulations applies to all re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
(b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and the
last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
(c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections, divisions, subdivisions or of subsections of a section,
such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any section, division,
subdivision or subsection included in such reference.
   References in the Sandusky County Park District Rules and Regulations to
action taken or authorized under designated sections of the Sandusky County
Park District Rules and Regulations include, in every case, action taken or
authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by
the Sandusky County Park District Rules and Regulations.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
(a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a number,
the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
(b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they
shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
(c)   (1)    If regulations enacted at different meetings are irreconcilable,
the regulation latest in date of enactment prevails.
(2)   If amendments to the same regulation are enacted at different meetings,
one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be
harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments
are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails. The
fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment,
or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of
itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only
when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
(a)   In enacting a regulation, it is presumed that:
(1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United States
is intended;
(2)   The entire regulation is intended to be effective;
(3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
(4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
(b)   A regulation is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
(c)   If a regulation is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention may
consider among other matters:
(1)   The object sought to be attained;
(2)   The circumstances under which the regulation was enacted;
(3)   The legislative history;
(4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the
same or similar subjects;
(5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
(6)   The administrative construction of the regulation.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Sandusky County Park District Rules and
Regulations or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid, the invalidity does not affect the other provisions or applications of
the section or related sections which can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application, and to this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09 WAIVERS; PERMITS.
(a)   There are occasions when the waiver of a particular rule is appropriate
or necessary with respect to programs or operations (e.g., allowing for group
functions or special event demonstrations or to accommodate extraordinary
attendance situations) or otherwise. Waivers of particular rules must be
written but may be included in permits, including without limitation conditions
of use (collectively, the "permits"). Inquiries regarding a waiver of a
particular rule should be directed to:

      (419) 334-4495
(b)   Whenever a request is made for a waiver of a particular rule by permit or

permits, based on the effect that granting the waiver/permit may have on
maintaining good order; preserving, protecting and maintaining the vegetation,
animals, streams and ponds; safeguarding the park users and the animals;
preventing damage and preserving the environment and otherwise conserving the
natural resources. The Director may designate park employees to execute

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),
the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course,

submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written
evidence.
(2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.02 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
(a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
(1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn movement to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
(2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed alone
or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously
enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or
such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
(3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication, as
provided in Section
313.03, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control device,
shall not cross the roadway.
(b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
(1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
(2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
(3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section  
313.03 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
(c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
(1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication,
unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by another
signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is no
stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication to proceed is
displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this
section.
B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a turn on red
or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular traffic facing
a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a
one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the
provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
(2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall
not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and,
unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by another
signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if there is no
stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection;
or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall
remain stopped until a signal indication or other traffic control device
permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is displayed.
B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a steady
red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
(3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as provided
in Section
313.03 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
(4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation on
State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red signal
at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice thereof
are posted at the intersection.
(5)   The Board may by regulation, or the authorized local authority may by
rule, prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red signal at any
intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice thereof are
posted at the intersection.
(d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication has
no meaning and shall not be used.
(e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
(1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to the left
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the opposite
direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when
such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
(2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to the left
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the opposite
direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when
such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
(3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
(4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
(f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
(1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a flashing
circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but
if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
(2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an intersection,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic
control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked
or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the flashing red
signal indication is first displayed.
(3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a beacon
to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified that
there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained thereon or
that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control device, which
might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. Use of this
signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not enter, or
wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the supplemented
traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
(g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal is
erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of
this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their
nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

States Postal Service or of a newspaper home delivery service, during any
period in which the person is engaged in the operation of an automobile to
deliver mail or newspapers to addressees. Subsections (b)(1) and (3) hereof do

of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of that nature or
causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation
of that nature, and no law enforcement officer shall view the interior or

adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who sustained
injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining device, was
not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was not wearing
such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules of
Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer, distributor or
seller of the passenger car.
C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that the injury
or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by some design
defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not crashworthy.

county peace officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the
county in which the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring
or has occurred has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or
believed to have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
(a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of an
offense unless both of the following apply:
(1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
(2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to
which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
(b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
(c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related to
knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
(2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined in
the Traffic Code.
(3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the
burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
(d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in determining
the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal offense.
Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to
act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily
intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was physically
capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
(e)   As used in this section:
(1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or sleep,
and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's volition,
are involuntary acts.
(3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in Section
501.08.
(4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication resulting
from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
(a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
(b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware
that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably
be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when the person
is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
(c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
(d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from due
care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s conduct
may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent
with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due
care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may
exist.
(e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to
establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
(a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
(b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
(c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
(d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
(e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
(f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
(a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
(b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with whom
the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
(c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless an
offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity in
an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
(d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant
in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the commission
of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an offense or an
offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the
following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
(e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that, prior
to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor terminated his
complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
(f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the commission
of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a principal
offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in
terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
(a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the following
circumstances:
(1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent or
employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of the
officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
(2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
(3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty imposed
by law on the organization.
(4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
(b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
(c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
(d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit or
not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, unincorporated
nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
(a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct
constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
(b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he is
subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC 2901.24)
501.13 EXEMPTIONS.
   Employees of the Sandusky County Parks and other authorized persons are
exempt from rules and regulations to the extent necessary stated in this
document when/where feasible or applicable while acting under their official
capacity as a Sandusky County employee or other authorized person(s).

(b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.04, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.04 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.04, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.04 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
(2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.04 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.04, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.04, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
(3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it is not
necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. Rather, it
is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given span of
time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same employment,
capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)(1) of this
section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims
or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection (b)(2) of this
section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense
in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or
(2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
(c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of property
or services involved in a theft offense:
(1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique, museum
piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic worth to
its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the
expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of materials,
supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business, trade,
occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered under
subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its purpose
regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the property with
new property of like kind and quality.
(3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered under
subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market
value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market value"
is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would accept
for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and the
seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
(d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
(1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
(2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
(3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw agricultural
products for which a local market price is available, the latest local market
price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
livestock, poultry or products.
(4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face value is
prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
(5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading, pawn
ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
(6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
(7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

(a)   A merchant, or his employee or agent, who has probable cause to believe
that items offered for sale by a mercantile establishment have been unlawfully
