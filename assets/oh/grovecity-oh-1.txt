EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

by a reenactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
101.05   CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08   SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.09   REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer or employee of the City exercising the powers, duties or
functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
(Ord. C45-66. Passed 7-11-66.)
101.10   ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word

   (c)   Provided that the current operating budget provides sufficient funds
and in accordance with the procedure set forth below, where applicable, the
following contracts shall not be subject to competitive bidding nor shall they
require further legislative authorization.
      (1)   Professional Services. Contracts for professional services shall

purchases and contracts for the purchase of supplies, materials and equipment
required by the Municipality and every department thereof. All shall be made in
the following manner:
      (1)   Requested purchases for services or supplies shall be made by the
department heads through a requisition form stating explicitly the items or
services desired. Where a requisition exceeds $10,000, it shall be accompanied
by a minimum of two independent vendor quotations, which may include a quote
from a purchasing group and/or consortium. This requirement may be waived at
the discretion of the Purchasing Agent. The requisition form will be submitted

available and sign a purchase order. The Administrative Assistant’s signature
on the purchase order shall constitute prima-facie approval of such procedure.
      (2)   Purchase order shall be on printed forms as determined by the
Administrative Assistant. They shall bear consecutive numbers as to date of
issue. After approval of requisitions, and after the certificate of the Finance
Director stating that money is available for such purchase from the proper fund
and account, the purchase order, with the price or quotation affixed, shall be
issued to the vendor, supplier or person rendering service. Every purchase
order shall be immediately posted to the encumbrance ledger and the sum shall
be subtracted from the respective appropriation account.
      (3)   The notice of receipt of goods or the provision of services along
with approval to pay for the goods shall bear the signature or other approval
of the department head or his/her designee. The signature or other approval
shall be affixed to invoice or saved in some other manner in the permanent
requisition/purchasing order file.
      (4)   All vouchers and warrants for the disbursement of City funds, with
the exception of expenditures for City personal services, shall bear the
purchase order number authorizing such expenditure.
      (5)   When an emergency purchase by an authorized City employee is
necessary outside of the normal operating hours of City Hall, the authorization
for the expenditure must be obtained from the Purchasing Agent or his/her
designee within two normal working days of City Hall. If the expenditure
involves funds which have not been appropriated by Council, an appropriation
ordinance must be passed.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision hereunder, when City Council, by
Resolution, determines that a Design-Build project delivery system shall be
employed on a public improvement and the estimated cost of the project exceeds
thirty thousand dollars ($30,000), the Design-Build contract shall be let as
follows:
      (1)   In addition to the project specific qualifications that the Design-
Builder shall meet as set forth in the contract documents for a particular
project, every Design-Builder, before entering a contract with the City, must

responsible to the Design-builder for project services.
         D.   The Design-Builder and architect shall agree that the architect
will have direct supervision of the architectural work and that the architect's
services will not be terminated on the project, without the immediate
replacement by another architect.
      (2)   When the City Administrator determines the need to engage
professionals to create Bridging Documents, such engagements shall be
Professional Services Contracts not subject to competitive bidding.
      (3)   Once the Bridging Documents are complete and incorporated into a
Request for Proposals for Design-Build Services, that Request for Proposals
shall be advertised in the same manner as the City has, or may establish, for
advertising competitive bids.
      (4)   The Request for Proposals shall require a project price to be
submitted with the Design-Builders’ proposals.
      (5)   The City Administrator shall evaluate and rank proposers according
to the requirements set forth in the Request for Proposals.
      (6)   Once ranked, the City Administrator shall negotiate with the first-
ranked proposer to ensure that the Design-Build contract meets the best
interests of the City.
      (7)   Should Grove City fail to reach an agreement with the first-ranked
proposer after ranking, it shall end negotiations with that proposer and begin
negotiations with the proposer next in the order of rank. Grove City shall
continue to negotiate with the proposers in their order of rank until a
contract is approved by Council.
      (8)   The Bridging Designer shall be eligible to submit a proposal for
the Design Build project for which it developed the Bridging Documents. (Ord.

Ohio Revised Code and the interest therefrom shall be credited to the General
Fund.
(Ord. C6-83. Passed 2-21-83.)
139.07   SCHEDULE OF FEES.
   (a)   The City Administrator shall establish a schedule of fees that shall
be reviewed annually by the City Administrator and Director of Finance, or
designees, and shall make any changes they deem reasonable and appropriate
including, but not limited to adjusting fees, terminating fees, or creating
additional fees. The schedule of fees shall be submitted to Council as part of
the annual budget process.
   (b)   Any fee required by state law to be collected by the City, now or in
the future, shall automatically become a fee chargeable by the City and listed
in the schedule of fees and shall automatically increase, decrease, or
terminate as mandated by state law.
   (c)   In the event of a conflict between any fee contained in the schedule
of fees adopted pursuant to this section and the same fee found in any other
section of the City's Codified Ordinances regarding the imposition of a fee
and/or the fee amount, the fee contained in the schedule of fees shall prevail.
Provisions of the Codified Ordinances requiring the imposition of a fee not
contained in the schedule of fees, and which fee is addressed in another or
other sections of the City's Codified Ordinances shall continue to apply.
   (d)   The schedule of fees shall be available on the City's website and

155.02   EXAMINATIONS; PREFERENCES.
   (a)   All applicants for positions and places in the classified service

of the United States and those persons who have legally declared their
intentions of becoming United States citizens, within certain limitations to be
determined by the Civil Service Commission, as to citizenship, residence, age,

provided in this chapter.
   (b)   Such examination may include an evaluation of such factors as
experience, education, training, capacity, knowledge, habit and moral
character, manual dexterity and physical or psychological fitness. Examinations
shall consist of one or more tests in any combination. Tests may be written,
oral, physical, demonstration of skill, or an evaluation of training and
experiences and shall be designed to fairly test the relative capacity of the
persons examined to discharge the particular duties of the position for which
appointment is sought. Examinations may include structured interviews,
assessment centers, work simulations, examinations of knowledge, skills, and
abilities, and any other acceptable testing methods. Where minimum or maximum
requirements are established for any examination, they shall be specified in
the examination announcement.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, when a position in the
classified service is to be filled, an examination shall be administered. The
Commission shall have control of all examinations. The Commission shall
prescribe the notification method that is to be used by the appointing
authority to notify the Commission that a position in the classified service of
the City is to be filled. Unless prohibited by a collective bargaining
agreement, the Commission may allow the appointing authority to fill a position
without an examination provided that the appointing authority can provide
sufficient justification for such appointment, and provided farther that the
opening has been advertised internally and that the candidate meets the stated
job requirements and is a current employee of the City.
      No questions in any examination shall relate to political or religious
opinions or affiliations. No extra credit for seniority, efficiency, or any
other reason shall be added to an applicant's examination grade unless the
applicant achieves at least the minimum passing grade on the examination
without counting such credit. Seniority shall be applied as set forth in this
chapter. Reasonable notice of the time, place and general scope of every
examination for appointment to a position in the civil service shall be given
by the Civil Service Administrative Advisory Officer or designee. Notices of

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States, has completed more
than 180 days of active duty service, pursuant to an executive order of the
President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States,
may file with the Commission, or its designee, a certificate of service or
honorable discharge, and, upon this filing, the person, on any original
appointment, excluding an original appointment for the Chief of Police, shall
receive additional credit of 10% of the person's total grade given in the
examination in which the person receives a passing grade.

   From the returns of the examinations, the Commission, or its designee, shall
prepare an eligibility list of the persons who scored not less than the minimum
score fixed by the Commission, and who are otherwise eligible. The names shall
be ranked based on examination score, including military and seniority credit,
without reference to when the application for the examination was made, with
the examinee receiving the highest grade being placed first on the list. If two
or more applicants receive the same score on an examination, including
consideration of veteran and seniority credit, priority in the time of filing
the application with the Commission, or its designee, shall determine the order
in which their names shall be placed on the eligibility list, except that
applicants eligible for veteran's preference under this chapter shall receive
priority in rank on the eligibility list over nonveterans on the list with a
rating equal to that of the veteran. Ties among veterans shall be decided by
priority of filing the application.
   An eligibility list expires one year after its creation or upon the
administration of a new examination. The Commission may approve an additional
one-year extension.
(Ord. C08-13. Passed 2-19-13.)
155.04   ORIGINAL APPOINTMENTS; CERTIFIED AND PROVISIONAL APPOINTMENTS;
PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   (a)   Upon written request of the appointing authority in which a position
in the classified service is to be filled, the Commission or its designee shall
certify to the appointing authority the names and addresses of the 12
candidates standing highest on the eligibility list for the class or grade to
which the position belongs; provided that the Commission may certify less than
12 names if 12 names are not available. If more than one position is to be
filled, the Commission shall certify to the appointing authority a list of
names consisting of the original 12 plus one name for each additional position
to be filled.
   (b)   Upon written request of South-Western City School District for a
position in the classified service is to be filled, the Commission or its
designee shall certify to South-Western City School District the names and
addresses of the 12 candidates standing highest on the eligibility list for the
class or grade to which the position belongs, or the top 25% of the eligible
list, whichever is greater; provided that the Commission may certify less than
12 names if 12 names are not available. When less than 12 names are certified
to South-Western City School District, appointment from the list shall not be
mandatory.
   (c)   The appointing authority shall appoint from the candidates on the
certified list. The certified list expires upon the filling of the position(s)
for which the list was requested. Each time a candidate removes himself/herself
from the certified list, the appointing authority may request a new certified
list.
   (d)   A person certified from an eligibility list more than three times to
the same appointing authority for the same or similar positions, may be omitted
from future certification to such appointing authority, provided that
certification for a temporary appointment shall not be counted as one of such
certifications.
   (e)   If an eligibility list becomes exhausted, or when no eligibility list
exists for a position, and it is unreasonable or administratively burdensome to
delay filling a vacancy in the classified service until an eligibility list can
be created, names may be certified by the Commission from eligibility lists
deemed to be most appropriate for the group or class of positions in which the
vacancy exists.
   (f)   Appointments to all positions in the classified service that are not
filled by promotion or transfer, shall be made only from those persons whose
names are certified to the appointing authority, and no employment, except as
provided in such sections shall be otherwise given in the classified service of
the City, unless otherwise provided in this chapter.
   (g)   All original and promotional appointments, including provisional
appointments made pursuant to this chapter, shall be for a probationary period
of one year. No original appointment or promotion is final until the appointee
has satisfactorily served the required probationary period. Service as a
provisional employee in the same or similar class shall be included in the
probationary period. If the service of the probationary employee is
unsatisfactory, the probationary employee may be removed or reduced at any time
during the probationary period. A probationary employee removed or reduced in
position for unsatisfactory service does not have the right to appeal the
removal or reduction. The provisions of this subsection relating to the
probationary period shall not be applicable to employees of South-Western City
School District unless provisions in conformity therewith have been included in
the adopted policies of the Board of Education or any collective bargaining
agreement applicable to such employees.

155.05   FILLING VACANCIES ABOVE RANK OF POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No positions above the rank of police officer in the Division of
Police shall be filled by original appointment, except for the position of
Chief of Police, which may be filled by either promotion or original
appointment, following an examination as defined in this chapter.
   (b)   No position above the rank of police officer in the Division of Police
shall be filled by any person, unless that person has first passed a
promotional examination. Promotion shall be by successive ranks so far as
practicable, and no police officer in the Division of Police shall be promoted
to the rank of Sergeant unless that person has first passed a promotional
examination and has served at least 60 months as a police officer. No person
with the rank of Sergeant or above shall be promoted to the next higher rank
unless that person has first passed a promotional examination and has served at
least 12 months in the then next lower rank. No person who takes an examination
shall be appointed to the position of Chief of Police unless that person has at
least 12 months experience in an equivalent rank or next lower rank in another
police department or law enforcement agency.
   (c)   No examination or promotional examination shall be held unless there
are at least two persons eligible and willing to compete. Whenever the
Commission determines that there are fewer than two persons eligible and
willing to compete, such Commission shall allow persons in the Division of
Police holding positions in the second lower rank than the position to be
filled who are eligible and willing, to compete for the position to be filled.
Whenever a vacancy occurs in the position above the rank of police officer in
the Division of Police and there is no eligibility list for such rank, the
Commission shall, within 180 days of such vacancy, hold a promotional
examination. After such examination(s) has been held and an eligibility list
has been established, the Commission, or its designee, shall forthwith certify
to the appointing authority the names of the three (five for position of Chief
of Police) persons receiving the highest rating, including any applicable
seniority or other preference points. When less than three (five for position
of Chief of Police) names are certified to an appointing authority, appointment
from that list shall not be mandatory. When the minimum number of names
required herein are certified, the appointing authority shall appoint one of
the three (five for position of Chief of Police) persons so certified within 30
days from the date of such certification. An eligibility list expires one year
after its creation or upon the administration of a new examination. The
Commission may approve an additional one-year extension. ( Ord. C32-18. Passed
5-21-18.)
   (d)   No credit for seniority or any other reasons shall be added to an
applicant's examination grade unless the applicant achieves at least the
minimum passing grade on the examination without counting such extra credit.
Seniority of service for a promotion in the Division of Police, beginning with
the date of employment as a full-time police officer with the City, shall equal
for each of the first four years of service, 1% of the total grade attainable
in the promotion examination, and, for each of the fifth through fourteenth
years of service, 0.6% of the total grade attainable. Notwithstanding any
provision herein, a candidate for promotion in the Division of Police may
petition the Commission for additional seniority credit, up to the maximum set
forth herein, for other full-time positions the candidate held if such
positions provided training or other skills that were related to and/or
beneficial to the candidate's current or prospective position within the
Division of Police. When ruling on such a determination, the Commission shall
have the ability to award full or partial credit up to the maximum set forth
herein. The decision of the Commission shall be final and not subject to
appeal.

155.06   PROMOTIONS.
   (a)   This section shall apply to promotions outside of the Division of
Police.
   (b)   Vacancies in positions in the classified service shall be filled
insofar as practicable by promotions, except as otherwise provided in this
chapter. The Commission shall provide for making promotions in the classified
service on the basis of merit, to be ascertained as far as practicable by
promotional examinations and by seniority in service. In all cases where
vacancies are to be filled by promotional examination, the Commission shall
certify to the appointing authority only the names of the three persons having
the highest score.
   (c)   In promotional examinations, seniority in service shall be added to
the examination grade, but no credit for seniority or any other reason shall be
added to an examination grade, unless the applicant achieves at least the
minimum passing score on the examination without counting such extra credit.
For all promotions, seniority of service beginning with the date of full-time
employment with the City shall equal for each of the first four years of
service, 1% of the total grade attainable in the promotion examination, and,
for each of the fifth through fourteenth years of service, 0.6% of the total
grade attainable. Unless otherwise provided herein, the procedural rules and
processes for original examinations shall apply to promotional examinations.

155.07   COMPETITIVE AND NONCOMPETITIVE POSITIONS IN THE SOUTH-WESTERN CITY
SCHOOL DISTRICT.
   (a)   Classifications in the South-Western City School District shall be
either competitive or noncompetitive. The Board of Education shall determine
whether each civil service classification for South-Western City School
District is competitive and therefore subject to examination pursuant to
Section
155.02(a) or is noncompetitive and therefore not subject to examination;
provided that, in determining whether a class shall be designated as
competitive or noncompetitive, the Board shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   The practicality of testing for the class by competitive
examination in accordance with generally accepted psychometric standards;
      (2)   Whether the positions in the class require peculiar and exceptional
qualifications of a scientific, managerial, professional, or educational
character as demonstrated by:
         A.   The level of education, the field of study, and the degree of
specialization required;
         B.   The kind, level, and amount of work experience required;
         C.   A special license or certificate required; and/or
         D.   Any recruiting or other information relating to the number and
availability of qualified applicants.
      (3)   Whether the class consists of unskilled positions for which it is
impractical to test for competitively;
      (4)   Whether other area school districts require competitive
examinations for similar positions; and
      (5)   Any other relevant information.
   (b)   Upon the effective date of this section, the Board of Education shall
certify to the Commission a list of job classifications under the jurisdiction
of this Commission with an indication as to whether such classifications are to
be deemed competitive or noncompetitive. Once a classification has been deemed
or determined to be competitive or noncompetitive, the Board may reconsider its
status at any time and must reconsider its status upon request of the
Commission.
   (c)   Upon establishing a new classification for the South-Western City
School District, the Board of Education shall, in keeping with the foregoing
criteria, determine whether such classification is competitive or
noncompetitive, and promptly notify the Commission of its determination.
   (d)   Classifications deemed or determined to be noncompetitive shall not be
subject to civil service examinations under this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapter
124 and all South-Western City School District appointments into noncompetitive
positions shall be subject solely to South-Western City School District's
internal hiring process and shall not be subject to this chapter or Ohio R.C.
Chapter 124.

(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.02   CONTRACT INTEREST.
   (a)   No member of Council nor any other officer or employee of the
Municipality shall be directly or indirectly interested in any contract, job,
work or service with or for the Municipality; nor in the profits or emoluments
thereof; nor in the expenditure of any money on the part of the Municipality.
Any contract with the Municipality in which any officer or employee is or
becomes interested may be declared void by Council. Nor shall the Mayor or
members of Council or directors of departments, during their terms of office,
or any other employee of the Municipality, during his employment by the
Municipality, practice law or give legal advice or be associated with another
in the practice of law in any matter or controversy in which the Municipality
is or may become a party, except on behalf of the Municipality as an officer or
employee.
   (b)   Any willful violation of this section constitutes malfeasance in
office and any officer or employee found guilty thereof under the terms of
these Codified Ordinances, the Charter or under the provisions of the general
law shall forfeit his office and the office shall be filled in accordance with
the provisions of the Charter as to vacancies.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.03   DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Policy. The City strongly disapproves and expressly prohibits any form
of unlawful harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
age, disability, status as a veteran or special disabled veteran, or any other
characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws.
   The City also prohibits sexual harassment of employees in any form. It is
City policy to provide an employment and business environment free of unwelcome
sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical
conduct or communication of a sexual nature constituting sexual harassment as
defined and otherwise prohibited by federal and state law.
   Specifically, no supervisor shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly
or implicitly, that an employee’s refusal to submit to sexual advances will
adversely affect the employee’s employment, evaluation, wages, advancement,
assigned duties, shifts, or any other condition of employment or career
development.
   Other sexually harassing conduct in the workplace, whether committed by
supervisors or non-supervisory personnel, is impermissible and prohibited
because it creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment
and/or unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance. This
includes, but is not limited to, any conduct of a sexual nature, including
verbal conduct, touching, solicitation or the display in the workplace of
sexual objects or pictures, where there has been an indication that such
conduct is unwelcome.
   Any conduct, as described above, whether by supervisors or non-supervisory
personnel, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
   (b)   Guidelines. It is policy to investigate thoroughly and remedy any
known incidents of harassment. In order to accomplish this, however, harassment
must be brought to the attention of management. Accordingly, employees who feel
aggrieved because of harassment have an obligation to communicate their problem
immediately. Employees who feel comfortable doing so should directly inform the
person engaging in harassing conduct that such conduct is offensive and must
stop; however, employees are not required to first directly address the person
who is harassing them. The following steps should be taken by an employee who
has a complaint of harassment:
      (1)   Any individual that believes that he or she has been subjected to
unlawful harassment, or witnessed unlawful harassment, should promptly file a
written report of that fact to the department director or the individual’s
immediate supervisor/manager. If the individual alleges harassment against the
department director and the individual’s immediate supervisor/manager, the
individual need not report the incident to the alleged harassers and instead,
may report the incident to the City Administrator. The written report should
identify the alleged incidents of harassment, the alleged perpetrators of the
harassment (if known), and any witnesses to the harassment. The report will be
kept confidential to the extent possible consistent with a thorough
investigation and any remedial action required.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a report of harassment, the City will investigate
the allegations. If the City determines that an individual has violated this
policy, the City will take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including
termination.
   The City encourages individuals who believe that they have been victims or
witnesses of harassment to come forward and report such harassment. The City
will not take any adverse action against an individual who in good faith comes
forward to report harassment, or provides assistance in an investigation,
regardless of whether the allegation is substantiated.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.04   POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
   No person, other than Council, the Mayor or any appointee of Council or the
Mayor, in the employ of the City shall directly or indirectly solicit or
receive, or be in any manner concerned in soliciting or receiving any
assessment, subscription or contribution for or against any political party,
any candidacy for office or the nomination therefor, any other issue at any
election or for any other political purpose whatever. No person shall orally or
in writing, solicit or receive, or be in any manner concerned in soliciting any
assessment, subscription or contribution for any such purpose from any person
holding a position with the City.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.05   OATH OF OFFICE.
   The oath of office as required by the Charter, Article IX, Section
9.01 shall be administered to every new employee of the City and filed and kept
in the office of the Clerk. The oath shall be signed by the person taking the
oath with at least two witnesses to the signature.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.06   INVENTORY OF CITY PROPERTY.
   A central inventory of all equipment, supplies, materials and property
belonging to the City shall be maintained by each department of the City. Such
perpetual inventory records shall be undertaken and maintained by the director
of each department in such manner and in such standardized method as the
director of each department requires, subject to the approval of the City
Administrator. Duplicates of all inventory records shall be filed with the City
Administrator by the several directors.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.07   CLASSIFICATION PLAN.
   (a)   Classification of Positions. All positions, unless otherwise noted,
shall be grouped into classes or grades and each class or grade shall include
those positions sufficiently similar in respect to their duties and
responsibilities and which have similar requirements as to training,
experience, knowledge and skills, and similar rates of compensation.
   (b)   Preparation and Content of Classified Service Specifications.
      (1)   Specifications shall be prepared by the City Administrator and
submitted to the Civil Service Commission. These specifications shall define
the duties and the desirable qualifications for successful performance of such
positions.
      (2)   The specifications shall not be incorporated into this Chapter, but
shall remain on file at the Municipal Building.
   (c)   Classified Service Plan. The list of class titles for the positions
along with the applicable rules regarding the classified service of this and
related Chapters shall be the Classified Service Plan.
   (d)   Allocation of Positions. The City Administrator and the Civil Service
Commission shall maintain a record of the allocation of individual positions to
appropriate classes and all amendments to the same. Any proposed change in
allocation of a classified service position shall be in accordance with this
Chapter.
   (e)   Responsibilities for Administration and Maintenance.
      (1)   The City Administrator, under the guidance of the Civil Service
Commission, shall be responsible for administering, maintaining and modifying
the Classified Service Plan. The City Administrator shall provide for the
reallocation of any position from one class to another class whenever a change
in duties and responsibilities of such a classified position makes the class to
which the position was previously allocated no longer applicable.
      (2)   Upon reallocation of an employee, the City Administrator shall
notify in writing such employee and his or her appointing authority setting
forth the proposed reallocation, pay range and salary. If the employee or
appointing authority desires a hearing, the party shall file a written request
within seven (7) days with the City Administrator and the Civil Service
Commission. Within thirty days after receiving written notification, the Civil
Service Commission shall set the matter for hearing and notify the City
Administrator, appointing authority and classified employee of the time and
place of the hearing. The parties, along with their legal representation if
desired, shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit facts for
consideration by the Commission.
      (3)   No person in classified service shall be reduced in pay or
position, laid off, suspended or discharged unless the appointing authority
furnishes such employee with a copy of the order, lay off, reduction or
suspension and his reasons for the same, and gives such employee a reasonable
time in which to make and file an explanation. In response to such action, the
Civil Service Commission upon request of the employee shall hold a similar
hearing as described above in subsection (e)(2). This does not apply to
employees on probationary status pursuant to Chapters
155 and
161.
   (f)   Changes Shall Be Initiated By the City Administrator and Civil Service
Commission and Council. Any changes to the structure of the Classified Service
Plan pursuant to this Chapter shall be initiated by the City Administrator.
Thereafter, such changes require the approval of the Civil Service Commission
and Council, excluding changes to the pay rate addressed below in
159.08.
   (g)   Employee Requests for Classification Adjustments. Any employee shall
have the right to consideration of any request he or she may have with respect
to change in the classification of his position (i.e. Classified or
Unclassified designation). The employee shall make his or her request to the
department head and the department head shall certify to the City Administrator
who shall arrive at a decision which is consistent with the Classified Service
Plan. If the City Administrator is unable to resolve such request in the manner
that the employee is requesting and the employee desires further review, the
matter shall be referred to the Civil Service Commission for consideration.
Statements of position may be submitted to the Commission by the parties. If a
change is suggested by the Commission after the consideration, this decision
must be reviewed for approval by the City Administrator and Council to be
adopted. The employee carries the burden of persuasion in such an appeal.
   (h)   Unclassified Employees. The City Administrator shall have the
authority and discretion to establish salaries and other terms and conditions
for employment for all unclassified personnel, subject to the restrictions of
this Chapter.
      (1)   In the event of the incapacity, retirement, resignation or absence
of a department head, the City Administrator shall have the right to appoint an
acting department head at the salary or within the salary range fixed by these
Chapters.
   (i)   Advancement to Succeeding Steps. Advancement to succeeding steps in
the compensation plan shall be pursuant to
Chapter 161. A classified employee may appeal a disapproval of advancement to a
succeeding step to the Civil Service Commission by giving written notice of
appeal to the Commission and City Administrator within seven (7) days after the
date on which the employee learns of such decision. The Commission shall
determine whether the action shall be upheld if an appeal is filed by the
affected employee. No hearing shall be held, however the affected employee and
the administration may submit statements of their respective positions. The
employee carries the burden of persuasion in such an appeal. The employee shall
have no further appeal rights.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.08   ADJUSTMENT AND REVIEW OF COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (a)   The rate scale for different grades of positions shall be changed by
the City Administrator and only in accordance with the procedures in this
Chapter and with the approval of Council.
   (b)   The applicable rules and provisions regarding the compensation of City
personnel of this and related Chapters shall be the Compensation Plan. Changes
in the Compensation Plan shall be made in a manner to maintain a proper
relationship among the grades of positions and to reflect changes in the cost
of living and in prevailing rates of pay comparable for positions outside the
City service.
   (c)   Every year the City administration will meet with all departments to
review the compensation rates of the City and submit the administration's
recommendation for any changes in this compensation to Council for their
consideration.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01.)
159.09   COMPENSATION.
   (a)   Pay Periods. Compensation shall be paid to every eligible officer or
employee of the City on a biweekly basis. Disbursements of pay checks shall be
on alternate Fridays at which time the officer or employee shall be paid
compensation earned for the immediately preceding two weeks including the date
of payment. The Director of Finance shall calculate the compensation earned by
officers and employees on an annual, monthly or hourly salary by dividing the
salary of such officer or employee, as nearly as possible, into equal biweekly
amounts.
   (b)   Regular Work Day. For all employees except police dispatch and
Division of Police employees as well as employees governed by a collective
agreement, a regular work day is an eight hour work period between the hours of
6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. as determined and designated by the City Administrator.
   (c)   Represented Employee Work Schedule. A regular work schedule for
employees represented by a union shall be according to the City’s agreement
with such respective union.
   (d)   Regular Work Week. For each employee (not covered by a collective
agreement or other exception determined by the City Administrator) whose
designated work day is eight or more working hours, a regular work week
consists of five consecutive work days in any seven day period followed by two
consecutive days off. A work week for all employees consists of forty hours of
time worked on behalf of the City. An employee excused from the performance of
his or her duties for observance of a holiday for which he or she is entitled
to compensation shall receive credit for the number of hours in his regular
work day in computing whether such employee completed a regular work week.
(Ord. C79-79. Passed 12-17-79.)
   (e)   Pension Pick-Up. The full amount of the statutorily required employee
contribution to the Public Employee Retirement System (PERS) shall be withheld
from the gross pay of employees, shall be "picked-up" by the City, and shall be
designated as public employer contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to PERS by each such employee. No employee subject to this "pick-
up" shall have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required
employee contribution to PERS instead of having it "picked-up" by the City or
of being excluded from the "pick-up". The City will not incur any additional
costs in the deferment of such federal and State income taxes. Should the rules
and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service or PERS change, making this
procedure unworkable, the City will return to the former contribution method.

161.01   EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS AND COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (a)   Structure and Entrance Salary.
      (1)   The Compensation Plan is organized into nine (9) pay grades for
non-executive personnel and two (2) pay grades for executive personnel. In the
non-executive pay grades, each grade is composed of one (1) probationary and
twenty (20) steps. The use of steps provides opportunity for personnel to move
through the step system within grade for growth and development. The
differentials between steps vary from step to step. Increments are higher in
the early steps, recognizing that learning occurs more rapidly in the early
stages of an employee’s tenure as the employee develops mastery of the skills,
knowledge and abilities required for effective performance of a job. The
executive personnel pay grade uses a minimum-maximum pay range system. For non-
executive pay grades, the initial employment salary will be set at the
appropriate step as determined by the City Administrator, based on demonstrated
skills, knowledge or ability developed in prior employment or education.
      (2)    Where an employee is promoted to a higher pay grade, the new rate
shall be set at the appropriate step as determined by the City Administrator
(Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-13.)
      (3)   Any employee who leaves or has left the City service to enter the
active service of the armed forces of the United States and who seeks
reinstatement shall be addressed pursuant to City policy and procedure as well
as the Ohio Revised Code and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act of 1994.
   (b)   Probation and Advancement within the Compensation Plan.
      (1)   After initial appointment or promotion to a new grade, the first
one (1) year of service in the position to which appointed or promoted shall be
considered a period of probation. In the event that the employee does not
satisfactorily complete his or her probationary period, he or she shall be
separated from the service except that, in the case of promotion from a lower
grade he or she shall revert to such position, if such position remains
available. Probationary employees, both classified and unclassified, may be
removed or demoted at any time after completion of a written evaluation and
notice to the employee by the City Administrator indicating that the employee's
performance is not satisfactory. Such removals or demotions shall not be
subject to appeal.
      (2)   As indicated in (a)(1) above, for non-executive personnel, a new
hire shall be placed at the appropriate step as determined by the City
Administrator within the pay grade, depending on the demonstrated skills,
knowledge and ability developed in prior employment or education. Movement
through steps within the pay grade is based on performance assessment results.
A review will be conducted no sooner than four (4) months but at least after
twelve (12) months of service. Recommendation to the City Administrator from
the department head for advancement is required. Advancement through steps
within the pay grade is undertaken in annual increases based on performance
assessment and longevity. An employee moves to the next higher step within the
pay grade after twelve (12) months served in the immediate prior step unless a
performance assessment identifies areas needing improvement. The performance
assessment results together with a plan for improvement will be submitted to
the City Administrator by the department head. A review of performance and
progress will be conducted after four (4) months. If improvements have been
made, the incumbent moves to the next higher step at that time with the next
consideration for a step increase being twelve (12) months thereafter. If at
the four (4) month review the performance problem persists, appropriate
disciplinary action may be considered. The employee shall be advanced to higher
steps until the employee has reached the maximum rate of the pay grade. All
step increases shall be effective on the next regular pay period date after
having been approved by the City Administrator. For executive personnel,
advancement through the pay grade system shall be based upon performance
assessment results conducted annually by the City Administrator, his or her
designee or the appropriate appointing authority. Executive personnel may be
subject to a development plan to assess shortcomings in performance. The amount
of the annual advances in pay shall be made on a discretionary basis by the
City Administrator or appropriate appointing authority consistent with this and
other applicable Chapters. (C127-05. Passed 12-19-05; Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-
13.)
   (c)   Recommendations for Award. If, based on the performance assessment, an
employee has achieved levels of performance well above those necessary for
adequate fulfillment of job duties, the City Administrator, upon documented
recommendation from the employee's department head or designated individual,
may issue a one (1) time performance award in the sole discretion of the City
Administrator. This award, which does not change the employee's basic pay grade
or step within the pay grade, would be a one (1) time payment of up to two
percent (2%) of the employee's base wage at the time of the award. This award
should be used only for the most exceptional situations and may only be used
once per employee within a twelve (12) month period.
   (d)   Requirements as to Continuity of Service. Service requirements for
advancement within the compensation schedule, Longevity Bonus and for other
purposes as specified in this Chapter shall require continuous service defined
as employment in the City service without break or interruption. Leaves of
absence of less than thirty (30) days shall not be construed to mean
interruption of continuous service. Approved absence with or without pay, in
excess of thirty (30) days, except for service with the armed forces of the
United States or the State of Ohio and approved FMLA leave, shall be deducted
in computing total service but shall not serve to interrupt continuous service.
(Ord. C10-87. Passed 3-16-87; Ord. C10-09. Passed 2-17-09; Ord. C40-22. Passed
6-20-22.)
   (e)   Eligibility Requirements for Employee Benefits. All full-time
classified and unclassified employees, excluding members of Council, the Mayor,
the Director of Law, and employees whose benefits are established by an
employment contract or collective bargaining agreement, may be eligible to
receive the benefits described in this chapter - except that the members of
Council and Mayor shall be eligible for insurance benefits described in this
chapter. (Ord. C114-90. Passed 1-7-91; Ord. C04-14. Passed 4-21-14.)
   (f)   Performance Measures and Personnel Forms.
      (1)   Performance Assessment. In cooperation with department directors,
the City Administrator shall establish a performance evaluation system to
determine employee performance as indicated throughout this Chapter. Employee
performance measures shall include quality and quantity of work, attendance and
attainment of departmental or divisional objectives and any other evaluations
and/or measures as the City Administrator or Director so determines.
   The performance evaluation ratings shall be considered in determining salary
increases and decreases within the limits fixed by the compensation plan and as
a factor in determining the demotion or dismissal or an employee. Performance
evaluation forms shall be reviewed with the employee being evaluated.
      (2)   Forms. The City Administrator shall prescribe the necessary
procedure for personnel reports, leave authorizations, employee status and pay
and performance evaluation. All departments shall utilize the procedure
prescribed, unless approved by the City Administrator.
(Ord. C10-87. Passed 3-16-87; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01; Ord. C10-09. Passed
2-17-09; Ord. C23-15. Passed 4-20-15; Ord. C10-21. Passed 3-1-21; Ord. C40-22.
Passed 6-20-22.)
161.02   PAY PERIODS, WORKDAY & PENSION PICK-UP.
   (a)   Pay Periods. Compensation shall be paid to every eligible employee of
the City on a biweekly basis. Disbursements of pay checks shall be on alternate
Fridays at which time the employee shall be paid compensation for the 80-hour
period ending on midnight of the Friday that precedes the pay day Friday. The
Director of Finance shall calculate the compensation earned by employees on an
annual, monthly or hourly salary by dividing the salary of such employee, as
nearly as possible, into equal biweekly amounts. (Ord. C05-12. Passed 2-6-12.)
   (b)   Regular Workday. For all employees except Police Dispatch and Division
of Police employees, as well as employees governed by a collective agreement, a
regular workday is an eight (8) or ten (10) hour work period as determined and
designated by the City Administrator. Employees may be assigned varying work
periods, as determined and designated by the City Administrator. (Ord. C25-13.
Passed 5-6-13; Ord. C40-22. Passed 6-20-22.)
   (c)   Represented Employee Work Schedule. A regular work schedule for
employees represented by a union shall be according to the City’s agreement
with such respective union.
   (d)   Regular Work Week. For each employee, not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement or other exception determined by the City Administrator,
whose designated workday is eight (8) or more working hours, a regular work
week consists of five (5) consecutive workdays in any seven (7) day period
followed by two (2) consecutive days off. A work week for all employees
consists of forty (40) hours of time regularly worked on behalf of the City. An
employee excused from the performance of duties for observance of a holiday for
which the employee is entitled to compensation shall receive credit for the
number of hours in the employee’s regular workday in computing whether such
employee completed a regular work week. (Ord. C40-22. Passed 6-20-22)
   (e)   Pension Pick-Up (Salary Reduction Method). The full amount of the
statutorily required employee contribution to the Public Employee Retirement
System (PERS) or the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (OPFPF) shall be
withheld from the gross pay of employees. This amount shall be “picked-up” by
the City, pursuant to the Salary Reduction Method, and shall be designated as
public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to PERS or
OPFPF by each such employee. No employee subject to this “pick-up” shall have
the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required employee
contribution to PERS or OPFPF instead of having it “picked-up” by the City or
of being excluded from the “pick-up”. The City will not incur any additional
costs in the deferment of such federal and State income taxes. Should the rules
and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service or PERS or OPFPF change, making
this procedure unworkable, the City will return to the former contribution
method.
(Ord. C10-09. Passed 2-17-09; Ord. C23-10. Passed 5-3-10; Ord. C40-22. Passed
6-20-22; Ord. C06-24. Passed 2-20-24.)
161.03   OVERTIME AND COMPENSATORY TIME.
   (a)   Overtime Eligibility. Non-exempt employees, as determined under the
Fair Labor Standards Act, required to work more than forty hours in any regular
work week shall be compensated for such overtime worked at one and one-half (1-
1/2) times the employee’s base rate of pay for each hour of overtime. Approved
or scheduled sick leave shall not be considered as hours worked for the purpose
of earning overtime. Such compensation for overtime work shall be paid at the
same time the employee receives a regularly scheduled paycheck for the time
period in which the overtime hours were worked. With approval of the City
Administrator, a non-exempt associate may receive the same overtime calculation
as a collective bargaining unit member. (Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-13; Ord. C15-
18, passed 3-20-18.)
   (b)   Work Week. For purposes of calculating overtime liability, the work
week shall be defined as the period of time starting at 12:00 a.m. Saturday and
ending at 11:59 p.m. Friday. The use of this standard work week may be altered
for specific positions with approval from the City Administrator and notice to
the affected employees at least one week before the changes take effect. (Ord.
C23-10. Passed 5-3-10.)
   (c)   Compensatory Time. If the City Administrator provides prior approval,
non-exempt employees may be granted compensatory time in lieu of payment of
overtime, for any time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in one work week.
Compensatory time will be granted at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) hours
of compensatory time for each hour of overtime worked. The City retains the
sole discretion as to whether or not compensatory time will be granted in-lieu
of payment for overtime worked.
   (d)   Compensatory Time Accrual Limitation. At no time shall compensatory
time accrue in excess of forty-five (45) hours per year. The City Administrator
may require the use of compensatory time by employees as provided by law.
   (e)   Carry Over. Compensatory time shall not be carried over from year to
year. At any time during the calendar year, an employee may request to be paid
for any accumulated but unused compensatory time at the employee’s most recent
base hourly rate. All remaining unused compensatory time shall be paid out at
the employee’s-base hourly rate at the end of the calendar year. Such payments
shall be made by January 31 of the next calendar year. Upon separation from
employment those employees eligible and awarded compensatory time shall be
entitled to compensation at their then current rate of pay for accrued and
unused compensatory time. (Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-13.)
(Ord. C4-89. Passed 2-6-89; Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01; Ord. C-06-08. Passed 2-
4-08; Ord. C10-09. Passed 2-17-09; Ord. C06-24. Passed 2-20-24.)
161.04   LONGEVITY BONUS.
   (a)   All eligible employees, as defined in Section
161.01(e), after the completion of five (5) years of full-time service with the
City, shall receive a longevity bonus pursuant to the following schedule

(Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-13; Ord. C40-22. Passed 6-20-22.)
   (b)   The longevity payment shall be made, in accordance with the above
schedule, in a separate lump-sum payment on the first pay period ending after
each anniversary date of each year. Upon termination for any reason, members
who are eligible for longevity pay under this section (or, in the event of
death, the estate of the deceased) shall be paid, as part of their terminal
pay, the final partial year of longevity pay, prorated to the number of hours
worked during such partial year since the member's last anniversary date. The
Director of Finance shall establish the rules and regulations for the
distribution of this bonus.

holidays fall on a Sunday, the holiday is observed on the following Monday; if
it falls on Saturday, it is observed on the preceding Friday. If a recognized

used. Members required to work on a recognized holiday shall receive one and a
half (1-1/2) times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in addition

   (b)   Vacation leave shall be scheduled by the director of each department

Upon separation from employment with the City, the employee shall be entitled
compensation at the employee's then current rate of pay for all accrued and
unused vacation leave at the time of separation from the City's service.
   (c)   All employees, as described in subsection (a) hereof, shall be allowed
to accrue vacation hours up to a maximum number of hours according to service

employee's base hourly rate at the end of the calendar year. Such payments
shall be made by January 31 of the next calendar year. (Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-
6-13.)
   (e)   Any eligible employee who is to be separated from the City service

appropriate taxes withheld, to the estate of the deceased at the employee's
most recent base hourly rate.

2-17-09; Ord. C23-15. Passed 4-20-15; Ord. C33-16. Passed 5-2-16; Ord. C40-22.
Passed 6-20-22.)
161.07   SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Accrual. Each eligible employee, as defined in Section
161.01(e), shall be entitled to sick leave of four and six-tenths (4 6/10)
hours with pay for each completed eighty (80) hours of service. Employees may
use sick leave, upon approval of the department head, for absence due to
personal illness, pregnancy, injury, exposure to contagious disease which could
be communicated to other employees, and illness, injury or death in the
employee’s immediate family. Immediate family as used herein is defined as
spouse, child, brother, sister, parents, grandparents, grandchild, father in-
law, mother in-law, son in-law, daughter in-law, brother in-law, sister in-law,
stepfather, stepmother, stepsister, stepbrother, stepson, stepdaughter, half-
brother, and half-sister. The City reserves the right to require employees to
utilize sick leave if the employee is or becomes visibly or obviously sick at
work. Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without limit. When sick leave is
used, it shall be deducted from the employee’s credit on the basis of a minimum
of one hour (1) for every one (1) hour of absence or part thereof from work, in
one (1) hour increments. The department head may require an employee to furnish
a satisfactory written and signed statement to justify the use of sick leave.
If medical attention is required, a certificate stating the nature of the
illness from a licensed physician may be required to justify the use of sick
leave and a statement of such leave shall be filed with the City Administrator
at the end of each pay period.
   (b)   Sick leave from another public agency. All eligible employees, as
defined in Section
161.01(e), entering the employment of the City may bring up to one hundred and
twenty (120) hours from their sick leave balance from another public agency as
defined in Ohio R.C. 124.38. The balance must be certified by the public
agency. Sick leave balances from another public agency may not be used until
all sick leave accrued through the City is exhausted. (Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-
13.)
   (c)   Certification. All eligible employees, as defined in Section
161.01 (e), leaving the employment of the City either upon termination or
retirement shall receive certification from the City of their unused sick
leave.
   (d)   Payment of Unused Sick leave Upon Retirement or Resignation. Any
eligible employee, as defined in Section
161.01 (e), leaving employment of the City either upon retirement or
resignation shall be compensated for the employee’s unused sick leave as set
forth herein. The amount of payment for unused sick leave shall be calculated
by subtracting three hundred sixty hours (360) hours from the certified sick
leave balance and dividing that result by two (2). The resulting hours shall be
paid at the employee’s final base rate of pay. A retiring employee is
guaranteed a payout equal to one-fourth (1/4) of the total number of sick leave
hours accumulated.
   (e)   Payment of Unused Sick leave Upon Termination. Any eligible employee
as defined in Section
161.01 (e), leaving employment of the City upon termination shall not be
eligible to receive payment for any unused sick leave.
   (f)   Payment of Unused Sick leave Upon Death. In the event an employee dies
as a direct result of an injury sustained in the course of employment, the
employee’s estate shall be paid on a day for day basis for his or her certified
sick leave of the employee’s final base rate of pay.
   (g)   Conversion. At any time, an eligible employee, as defined in Section
161.01 (e), who has accumulated and maintains three hundred sixty (360) or more
hours of unused sick leave shall be given the option of converting unused sick
leave earned with the City for paid compensation of fifty percent of the total
hours at the employee’s regular base rate of pay; (for example, one hundred
(100) hours will yield a total of fifty (50) hours of pay multiplied by the
employee’s regular base rate). No employee conversion per this section may

      (2)   Procedure.
         A.   An employee qualifying for sick leave donation hereunder shall
make a written request for such leave by completing the necessary form and

designee. Written documentation from a medical doctor of the employee’s serious
illness or injury must be attached to the request. The City Administrator shall
have the discretion to approve or deny such request. Copies of the written
request and written documentation from a medical doctor shall be provided to
Human Resources. (Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-13.)
         B.   Upon approval of a request for sick leave donation, the City
Administrator or City Administrator’s designee shall complete the necessary
form and forward copies of same to the employee requesting sick leave donation.
         C.   An employee wishing to donate sick leave to a fellow employee

      (3)   Approval. Upon approval of an employee’s request for donated sick
leave, the City Administrator or City Administrator’s designee shall:
         A.   Notify all eligible employees of the employee’s need for donated
sick leave, while respecting the employee’s right of privacy;
         B.   Approve payment of any such donated sick leave to the requesting
employee on a pay period by pay period basis up to the amount of donated leave,
or the hours necessary to provide the member with their regular, straight-time
pay for such pay period, whichever is greater.
      (4)   Donating Sick Leave. Employees may donate accrued and unused sick
leave to their credit to any other employee who has been approved to receive
donated sick leave if the donating employee:
         A.   Retains a sick leave balance of at least two hundred forty hours
after deduction of the hours offered for donation; and
         B.   Voluntarily elects to donate sick leave to the employee approved
for donation, understanding that any such leave donated and not used shall be
returned.
      (5)   Terms and Conditions. The following additional terms and conditions
shall apply to the Sick Leave Donation Program:
         A.   All donation of sick leave shall be in eight-hour increments,
with eight hours being the minimum donation;
         B.   An employee receiving donated sick leave shall be paid at the
employee’s regular, straight-time rate of pay, regardless of the rate of pay of
the employee donating such leave;
         C.   Sick leave shall be deducted from donating employee
proportionately from all donated hours and credited to the receiving member’s
account on pay day up to the amount necessary for the employee to be paid their
regular two (2) week’s pay. No sick leave shall accumulate in the account of a
receiving employee or be converted to cash or compensatory time. Any sick leave
donated by an employee that is not used shall remain in the account of the
donating employee.
         D.   An employee using donated sick leave shall be in active pay
status and shall accrue sick and vacation leave, and be entitled to any
benefits they would normally receive. All paid leave provided to or accrued by
an employee while using donated sick leave shall be used in the following pay
period before donated sick leave is used.
         E.   Employees receiving donated sick leave shall be eligible to
receive such leave only until the employee’s estimated date of return to duty,
or until the first pay period during which the receiving employee fails to
receive enough donated leave to receive their full two (2) weeks pay. Employees
who have continued to receive full donations and whose physicians extend their
estimated date of return will be eligible for notification for the need for
further donation.
         F.   No employee receiving donated sick leave will be permitted to be
off work on such leave more than twelve (12) consecutive calendar months. An
employee may not apply for donated leave more than once in any twelve (12)
month period.
         G.   No employee may donate more than eighty (80) sick leave hours to
another employee in a calendar year. (Ord. C15-18. Passed 3-20-18.)
         H.   The City Administrator or City Administrator’s designee shall

fellow employee. Donation shall be strictly voluntary. Only the Human Resource
Coordinator shall directly solicit donations of sick leave from another
employee.

161.08   LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   (a)   Special Leave. For eligible employees, as defined in Section
161.01(e), the City Administrator may authorize special leave of absence
without pay for any period or periods not to exceed three (3) calendar months
in any one calendar year in the City Administrator’s sole discretion. In
addition, the City Administrator may require special leave be dual counted
along with leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. While an employee is
on special leave, they shall be responsible for the full cost of the employee’s
benefit program and any other requirements set by the City, unless regulated by
state or federal law or as required by the Family Medical Leave Act.
   (b)   Absence Without Leave. An employee who intends to be absent from duty
shall report the reasons therefore to the employee's supervisor prior to the
date of absence when practical and in no case later than noon of the first day
of absence, if at all possible. All unauthorized and unreported absences shall
be considered as absence without leave. For non-exempt employees, a reduction
in pay shall automatically be made for the period of absence. For all
employees, such unauthorized absence may be made the grounds for disciplinary
action up to and including discharge.
   (c)   Military Leave. Employees who are members of the Ohio National Guard,
the Ohio Defense Corps., the State and Federal Militia, or members of other
reserve components of the Armed Forces of the United States are entitled to
leaves of absence from their respective duties without loss of pay, and without
any offset for receipt of military pay, for the time they are performing
service in the uniformed services, as defined in Section 5903.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code., for periods of up to one hundred seventy-six (176) hours within
one (1) calendar year. Employees are required to submit to the City an Order or
statement from the appropriate military commander as evidence of such duty.
There is not a requirement that the service be in one (1) continuous period of
time. The maximum number of hours for which payment will be made in any one (1)
calendar year under this provision is one hundred seventy-six (176) hours.
Members of those components listed in this division (c) will be granted
emergency leave for mob, riot, civil defense, or similar duties when so ordered
by the Governor to assist Civil Authorities. Such emergency leave will be
without pay if it exceeds authorized military leave for the year as indicated
above. The leave will cover the official period of the emergency. Employees who
are called or ordered to service by the President of the United States or an
act of Congress for periods beyond one hundred seventy-six (176) hours within
the calendar year are entitled to leaves of absence and to be paid in total the
lesser of:
      (1)   The difference between the employee's gross monthly wage and the
sum of the employee's gross uniformed pay and allowances for the month; or
      (2)   Five hundred (500) dollars.
   No pay for such periods will be received if the employee's military pay
exceeds the pay as a City employee. The leave will cover the official period of
the emergency.

161.11   TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM.
   (a)   Approval of Coursework. All full-time and part-time employees shall be
eligible to participate in the City’s Tuition Reimbursement Program. Under this
program, each employee shall be eligible for a maximum of five thousand dollars
($5,000) in reimbursement per calendar year for tuition, and books, in courses
of instruction voluntarily undertaken. Courses of instruction eligible for
reimbursement under this program shall include courses necessary for job-
related degree programs or courses of study not necessarily within a job-
related degree program but which are still job-related. In addition, only
coursework provided by a recognized institution (e.g. college, university,
community college, post-secondary technical school, etc.) shall be eligible for
reimbursement under this program. No reimbursement shall be approved for
correspondence courses. Reimbursement shall include cost for all registration
fees and textbooks.
(Ord. C25-13. Passed 5-6-13; Ord. C15-18. Passed 3-20-18; Ord. C61-22. Passed

   (b)   Reimbursement Process. All coursework subject to potential
reimbursement shall be transmitted, in advance of enrollment in the course and
through the employee's department/division head, to the City Administrator for
approval. The department/division head shall provide a written recommendation
concerning approval/disapproval of the request at time of transmittal. An
employee shall make application for approval of the course work at least
fifteen (15) days prior to commencement of the course of study. The City
Administrator shall evaluate the employee's coursework/degree program for job-
relatedness and shall notify the employee, in writing, regarding the approval/
disapproval of said coursework/degree program on that basis.
   Courses are to be taken on other than scheduled working hours, unless
approval is obtained from the appropriate department/division head and the City
Administrator to take such courses on work time.
   An employee must timely complete all coursework in the regularly scheduled
course schedule and receive a grade of “C” or better to be reimbursed per this
program.

4-20-15.)
161.12   DISCIPLINE.
   (a)   Policies and Procedures. The City's policies, procedures and
guidelines for all employees are set forth in the Employee Handbook and are
expected to be followed. The City may discipline an employee if necessary, be
it progressive or general discipline, up to and including discharge as
determined by the City in its discretion. The City maintains the discretion to
classify offenses and violations of its policies, procedures and guidelines and
to determine the level of discipline on a case-by-case basis.
   (b)   Work Rule Examples. In addition to violations of Laws and Ordinances,
personnel rules and regulations, and departmental rules and regulations,
examples of activities that may result in discipline include, but are not
limited to, the following:
      (1)   Failure to follow the lawful orders of a supervisor or department
head;
      (2)   Absence from work without permission;
      (3)   Continued absence or tardiness;
      (4)   Failure to perform assigned work in an acceptable manner;
      (5)   Waste of material, property or working time, including, but not
limited to, abuse of City equipment or unauthorized use of City equipment;
      (6)   Inability to get along with fellow employees so that work is
hindered or does not meet required standards;
      (7)   Drinking, possession, or using a drug of abuse (including, without
limitation cannabis and its derivatives) on the job or appearing for work under
the influence of alcohol or a drug of abuse; (Ord. C15-18. Passed 3-20-18.)
      (8)   Rudeness or disrespect in dealing with the public;
      (9)   Any conduct which adversely reflects on the professional reputation
of the employee or the City, or which evidences a lack of fitness or ability of
the employee to perform the duties of an employee of the City; or
      (10)   Any criminal offense.
   (c)   Progressive Discipline. When in the best interest of the City, as
determined by the City Administrator, the principles of progressive
disciplinary action will be followed with respect to minor offenses.
   When in the best interest of the City, as determined by the City
Administrator, disciplinary action shall first be reviewed by the employee's
immediate supervisor. The failure of the immediate supervisor to take action
shall not preclude any higher supervisory authority from initiating
disciplinary action. At the City's sole discretion, such action may consist of,
and in any order or step:
      (1)   Reprimand which shall become part of the employee's personnel file;
      (2)   Suspension from duty without pay;
      (3)   Dismissal.
   Any disciplinary action which affects the pay or status of an employee shall
be reviewed and approved by the City Administrator prior to becoming effective.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to preclude an employee from being
relieved of duty, with pay, if in the judgment of any higher supervisory
authority such action is necessary. In all cases of discipline, the procedure
set forth in these chapters shall control, unless otherwise provided for by a
collective bargaining agreement entered into by the City.
   Any classified employee whose actions make the employee subject to
dismissal, demotion or change in pay status shall be provided with oral or
written notice of the charges against the employee, an explanation of the
City's reasons for the proposed termination, and an opportunity to present the
employee's version of the facts relating to the charges.
   (d)   Supervisors. The duty of maintaining discipline among employees shall
rest initially with the immediate supervisor and finally with the City
Administrator.
   (e)   Record of Actions. Whenever a disciplinary action is taken which
results in a disciplinary action of record, the employee shall be given a copy
of such record. The action may also be used in any performance assessment.
(Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01; Ord. C10-09. Passed 2-17-09.)
161.13   FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT.
   It is the policy of the City to grant up to twelve (12) weeks of family and
medical leave
during a "rolling" twelve (12) month period to eligible employees in accordance
with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and up to 26 weeks for
certain military caregiver leave. A rolling twelve (12) month period means the
twelve (12) month period measured backwards from the date an employee uses the
leave, provided the eligible employee has leave. If the eligible employee does
not, the leave will be unpaid, however, benefits will continue during the leave
as required by law.
   Employees may be required to provide a return-to-work form from their
medical provider when returning from FMLA leave. If the City believes the
employee cannot perform the essential functions of the position, the City may
require a Fitness for Duty Certification (FDC) examination from a City approved
medical provider. The City may delay restoration of employment until the FDC is
provided. Unless the employee provides either a FDC or new medical
certification for a serious health condition at the time the employee's FMLA
leave concludes, the employee may be terminated.
   The City's policies, procedures and guidelines for Family and Medical Leave
Act ("FMLA") leave are set forth in the Employee Handbook.
(Ord. C40-22. Passed 6-20-22.)
161.14   WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION.
   (a)   Standards of Conduct. All persons should be treated with courtesy and
respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting,
"horseplay", or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms,
weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are strictly
prohibited on City property.
   Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, vendor, or
member of the public will not be tolerated.
   (b)   Reporting Threats. All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct
and indirect, made by an employee, vendor, or member of the public should be
reported as soon as possible to the City Administrator. All suspicious
individuals or activities should also be reported. If there is a disturbance
near a work area, employees should not attempt to intercede. Instead,
immediately notify a supervisor or, if necessary, the police.
   All reports of threats, violence, and suspicious individuals and activity
will be investigated promptly and thoroughly. The identity of the reporting
individual will be protected to the extent practical. In order to maintain
workplace safety and the integrity of the investigation, employees may be
suspended with or without pay pending the outcome of the investigation.
   Any employee responsible for conduct in violation of this policy will be
subject to discipline up to and including discharge, as well as the possibility
of prosecution.
(Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01; Ord. C10-09. Passed 2-17-09.)
161.15   DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Discrimination and Harassment Prohibited. The City expressly prohibits
any form of unlawful discrimination or harassment based on race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, military status, status as a
veteran or special disabled veteran, ancestry, familial status, pregnancy,
sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression or any other
characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws.
   (b)   Policy. In compliance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
as amended, and Ohio Revised Code 4112.01 et seq., it is the policy of the
City:
      (1)   To provide equality of opportunity in employment with the City for
all persons.
      (2)   To carry out all programs and activities in such a manner that no
person shall, on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
age, disability, military status, status as a veteran or special disabled
veteran, ancestry, familial status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender
identity, or gender expression be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination or harassment with respect to
such programs or activities.
   (c)   Sexual Harassment. The City also prohibits sexual harassment of
employees in any form. It is City policy to provide an employment and business
environment free of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and
other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature or based
on one’s sex constituting sexual harassment as defined and otherwise prohibited
by federal and state law.
   Specifically, no supervisor shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly
or implicitly, that an employee’s refusal to submit to sexual advances will
adversely affect the employee’s employment, evaluation, wages, advancement,
assigned duties, shifts, or any other condition of employment or career
development.
   Other sexually harassing conduct in the workplace, whether committed by
supervisors or non- supervisory personnel, is impermissible and prohibited
because it creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment
and/or unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance. This
includes, but is not limited to, any harassing conduct based on one’s sex or
gender or conduct of a sexual nature, including verbal conduct, touching,
solicitation or the display in the workplace of sexual objects or pictures,
where there has been an indication that such conduct is unwelcome.
   Any conduct, as described above, whether by supervisors or non-supervisory
personnel, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
   (d)   Guidelines-Reporting and Investigation. It is policy to investigate
thoroughly and remedy any known incidents of discrimination and harassment. In
order to accomplish this, however, harassment and discrimination must be
brought to the attention of management. Accordingly, employees who feel
aggrieved because of harassment or discrimination have an obligation to
communicate their problem immediately. Employees who feel comfortable doing so
should directly inform the person engaging in harassing or discriminatory
conduct that such conduct is offensive and must stop; however, employees are
not required to first directly address the person who is harassing or
discriminating against them. The following steps should be taken by an employee
who has a complaint of harassment or discrimination:
      (1)   Any individual that believes that he or she has been subjected to
unlawful harassment or discrimination, or witnessed unlawful harassment or
discrimination, should promptly file a written report of that fact to the
department director or the individual’s immediate supervisor/manager. If the
individual alleges harassment or discrimination against the department director
and the individual’s immediate supervisor/manager, the individual need not
report the incident to the alleged harassers or discriminators and instead, may
report the incident to the City Administrator or Human Resource Coordinator.
The written report should identify the alleged incidents of harassment and/or
discrimination, the alleged perpetrators of the harassment and/or
discrimination (if known), and any witnesses to the harassment and/or
discrimination. The report will be kept confidential to the extent possible
consistent with a thorough investigation and any remedial action required.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a report of harassment and/or discrimination, the
City will investigate the allegations. If the City determines that an
individual has violated this policy, the City will take appropriate
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   The City encourages individuals who believe that they have been victims or
witnesses of harassment and/or discrimination to come forward and report such
harassment and/or discrimination. The City will not take any adverse action
against an individual who in good faith comes forward to report harassment or
discrimination, or provides assistance in an investigation, regardless of
whether the allegation is substantiated. The City prohibits retaliation in all
forms.

4-4-22.)
161.16   EMPLOYMENT AT-WILL.
   Unless otherwise protected by law or agreement, employment with the City is
not for any definite period of time and is employment at-will. Both the City
and the employee may terminate this at-will relationship at any time and for
any reason not contrary to law. No representative of the City, except the City
Administrator by express written agreement, has the authority to make
representations or agreements with any employee that are contrary to the
foregoing. Notably, successful completion of any "probationary" period does not
alter at-will status.
(Ord. C47-01. Passed 8-6-01; Ord. C10-09. Passed 2-17-09.)
161.17   PAID BIRTH LEAVE.
   (a)   The City provides four (4) weeks paid birth leave for vaginal
deliveries or six (6) weeks paid birth leave for C-section deliveries "Birth
Leave" in a rolling 12-month period to an employee following the birth of that
employee's child to enable the employee to recover medically from the birth.
Birth leave runs concurrently with unpaid Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA")
leave. Employees may use birth leave to supplement other paid leave, where
permitted and where applicable.
   (b)   To be eligible, employees must have been employed by the City for at
least ninety (90) days in a full-time status and must have given birth to a
child.
   (c)   The fact that a multiple birth occurs (e.g., the birth of twins) does
not increase the total amount of paid birth leave granted for that event. Nor
will any employee receive more than the specified allotment of paid birth leave
in any rolling 12-month period. Birth leave may, however, be split between
temporally separate births.
   (d)   Each week of paid birth leave is compensated up to 100% of the
employee's regular rate of pay.
   (e)   All payments under this policy will be made in accordance with
standard payroll practices.
   (f)   Employees must take paid birth leave in one continuous period of leave
immediately following the birth of the child except as defined in (g).
   (g)   Birth Leave may begin up to one week prior to the birth of the child,
upon prior authorization from the administration. Medical documentation may be
required to substantiate the need for leave in advance of a birth.
   (h)   Upon termination of the individual's employment, an employee will not
be paid for any unused birth leave for which the employee was eligible.
   (i)   After the paid birth leave is exhausted, the balance of FMLA leave (if
applicable) will be compensated, if at all, in accordance with the City's FMLA
and paid leave policies.
   (j)   Employees are required to provide notice of the need for paid birth
leave as soon as practicable.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
   
Chap. 171.   Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
      The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or ?) the defendant
waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
      The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth
in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
      Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau
and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule
of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

   As used in this chapter, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed
to them in this section, and except as and if the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning:
   (a)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" means a "C" Corporation's Federal
Taxable Income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, but including subsequent adjustments from
required additions and deductions. Pass-through entities must compute "Adjusted
Federal Taxable Income" as if the pass-through entity was a "C" Corporation.
This definition does not apply to any taxpayer required to file a return under

definition is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2004.

employee of the taxpayer at the place where delivery is made.
(Ord. C104-90. Passed 12-17-90.)
191.04   LEVY OF TAX.
   (a)   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the
income, salaries, wages, commissions, rents and other compensation earned and/

(Ord. C7-71. Passed 3-1-71.)
191.05   RETURN; PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer who engages in business, or whose income, salaries,

salaries, wages, commissions, rents and other compensation earned and/or
received, and/or net profits earned and/or gross income from such business less
allowable expenses in the acquisition of such gross income earned during the
preceding year and subject to the tax, together with such other pertinent

a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity,
except any portion of a loss separately reportable for municipal tax purposes
to another taxing entity, may be used to offset the profits of another for
purposes of arriving at overall net profits. A husband and wife, in any taxable
year, may elect to file separate or joint returns. (Ord. C74-82. Passed 10-18-
82.)
   (c)   If a net operating loss has been sustained in any taxable year, such

   (d)   Consolidated returns.
      (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may

has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return with the City,
the affiliated group may not change their method of filing in any subsequent
tax year without written approval from the City.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Director of Finance
shall require such additional information as the Director of Finance may deem
necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City.
If the Director of Finance finds net profits are not properly allocated to the
City by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations
related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other
method, the director of finance shall make such allocation as the Director of
Finance deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper allocation of net
profits to the City.
(Ord. C73-77. Passed 9-19-77.)
   (e)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the City the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided, however,
that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted at the source
pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.07 or where any portion of the tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
191.08 or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit for
the amount so paid in accordance with Section
191.15 shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
   (f)   A taxpayer who has overpaid his income tax in any taxable year may
request a refund, provided, however, there is no other tax liability and that
no amount of less than one dollar ($1.00) will be refunded or collected.
(Ord. C7-71. Passed 3-1-71.)
   (g)   The Director shall have the authority to extend the time for filing of
the annual return, provided, the request of the taxpayer for extension is made
in writing and received on or before the original due date of the return. The
extension period requested may not exceed six months. For taxable year 2004 the
extended due date shall be the last day of the month following the month to
which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended. For
taxable years subsequent to 2004 the extended due date shall be the last day of
the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has been
extended. The Director of Finance may deny the extension if the taxpayer's
income tax account with the City of Grove City is delinquent in any way. The
Director may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount
of tax shown to be due thereon on or before the original due date. No penalty
shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax
paid within the period as extended.
   (h)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (i)   A loss from the operation of a business may not be used to offset the
income on a taxpayer's W-2 form.
   (j)   Expenses shown on Federal Form 2106 are deductible, but are subject to
review and audit by the City's income tax office. The 2106 expenses must be
apportioned to municipalities in the same manner to which the related income is
apportioned.
   (k)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of withholding the tax and making the
payment, shall be personally liable for failure to withhold or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization or other fundamental change of any such employer does not
discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of such
business to withhold the tax or pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
(Ord. C104-90. Passed 12-17-90. Ord. C27-05. Passed 4-4-05.)
191.06   AMENDED RETURN; REFUNDS FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional
income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid
subject to the requirement and/or limitations contained in Section 191.05, such
amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the Director of
Finance. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e., cash or
accrual) or apportionment of net profits, nor the method of filing (i.e.,
single or consolidated), after the due date for filing the original return.
(Ord. C71-10. Passed 12-6-10.)
   (b)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayments.
   (c)   No refund shall be allowed unless a written request is presented to
the Director within three years of the date on which such payment was made or
the return was due. However, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax
withheld from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (d)   Income tax that has been deposited with Grove City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Grove City as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that
should have been deposited with Grove City, but was deposited with another
municipality, shall be subject to recovery by Grove City. Grove City will allow
a non-refundable credit for any amount owed grove city that is in excess of the
amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the
other municipality is the same or higher than Grove City's tax rate. If Grove
City's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the rates
is also subject to collection by Grove City.
(Ord. C7-71. Passed 3-1-71.)
191.07   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City, shall deduct
at the time of payment of such income, salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation, the tax of two percent (2%) of the income, salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to such employee and
shall make a return showing the amount of taxes so deducted. The return shall
include a record of payments showing that all taxes deducted during the
withholding period have been paid to the City in accordance with the payment
schedule prescribed in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) hereof. Such employer shall
be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld,
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld. Every employer or officer
of a corporation is deemed to be a trustee for this municipality in collecting
and holding the tax required under the ordinance to be withheld and the funds
so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds. Employers shall
pay to the City all income taxes withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on either a semimonthly, monthly or quarterly basis depending on the
amount of taxes involved according to the following payment schedule: (Ord.

payment shall be paid to the City within five banking days after the fifteenth
and the last day of each month. (Ord. C55-75. Passed 9-2-75.)
      (2)   Monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be made by an employer if
the taxes withheld in the prior calendar year were less than twelve thousand
dollars ($12,000) but more than three thousand five hundred ninety-nine dollars
($3,599) or if the taxes withheld during any month for the preceding quarter
exceeded three hundred dollars ($300.00). Such payments shall be paid to the
City within fifteen days after the close of each calendar month.(Ord. C55-75.
Passed 9-2-75; Ord. C104-90. Passed 12-17-90.)
      (3)   All employers not required to make semimonthly or monthly payments
of taxes withheld under paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof shall make quarterly
payments no later than the last day of the month following the end of each

   (b)   The employer shall make and file a return on a form furnished by the
Director of Finance, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer from
the income, salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of any employee
and paid by the employer to the City. (Ord. C107-04. Passed 12-6-04.)
   (c)   Each employer on or before January 31, unless written request for
thirty days extension is made to and granted by the Director following any
calendar year in which such deductions have been made, or should have been made
by any employer, shall file with the Director an information return, Grove City
Withholding Statement of Wages Paid and Grove City Income Tax Withheld, for
each employee from whom income tax has been or should have been withheld
showing the name, address, and social security number of the employee, the
total amount of income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation
paid the employee during the year and the amount of City income tax withheld
from each employee.
(Ord. C7-71. Passed 3-1-71.)
   (d)   Where a resident of the City performs service for his employer in
another municipality, which services are subject to withholding in the other
municipality, the employer shall have the authority to reduce the withholding

levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel, motel or transient
accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests.

indigent individuals, when such charitable organization pays the hotel or
transient accommodation for such lodging.
   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent
the evasion of the taxes it is presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels or
transient accommodations in the City to transient guests is subject to the
taxes until the contrary is established.

of the organization for such fiscal year, as prepared by a certified public
accountant or federal tax form 990 as filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of
Chapter 192 shall apply to the tax imposed under this section. (Ord. C123-88.

192.03   TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to
the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
taxes. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the taxes apply.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.04   REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Director of Finance shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the Director or his agent, he shall
refund to the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the Director,
on the form prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it is
ascertained that the assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous. However,
in any event such application for refund must be filed with the Director within
four years from the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of tax. On filing
of such application, the Director shall determine the amount of refund due. The
Director shall make such payment from the General Fund.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.05   REQUIRED RECORDS; INSPECTION AND DESTRUCTION.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the taxes the
vendor's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Directory of Finance and shall
be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.06   RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall, on or before the twentieth day of each month, make and
file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Director of
Finance, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of taxes due
from the vendor to the City for the period covered by the return and such other
information as the Director deems necessary for the proper administration of
this chapter. The Director may extend the time for making and filing returns.
Returns shall be filed by mailing the same to the Director, together with
payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
   The Director may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as to
merit monthly returns, as determined by the Director upon the basis of
administrative costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   The Director shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date received
by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of payment
received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a return under this
chapter, shall forfeit and pay into the City Treasury a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the taxes owed.
   The Director, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the
taxes imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payment to be made for
other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or his
authorized agent.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.07   LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   If any vendor collects taxes imposed by or pursuant to this chapter and
fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, he shall be personally
liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Director of
Finance may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any information
in the Director's possession.
   If any vendor fails to collect the taxes or any transient guest fails to pay
the taxes imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject to
the taxes, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable for the
amount of the taxes applicable to the transaction. The Director may make an
assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession.
   An assessment against a vendor in cases where the taxes imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter have not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the taxes
applicable to such transaction.
   In each case the Director shall give to the vendor or transient guest
assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served upon the
vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered or certified
mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to an
assessment against the other for the taxes applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the taxes due on a particular transaction if such taxes have actually
been paid by another.
   The Director may make an assessment against any vendor who fails to file a
return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount of taxes in
accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of the
Director indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or should be,
greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the Director may, upon the
basis of test checks of a vendor's business for a representative period which
are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which the taxes required to be
collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's or transient accommodation's
lodgings which determination shall be the basis of an assessment as herein
provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment shall be made in the manner
prescribed in this chapter.
   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom such notice of assessment is
directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either personally or
by registered or certified mail, a petition in writing, verified under oath by
such vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent, having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with particularity the items of such assessment objected
to, together with the reasons for such objections, such assessment shall become
conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable from the vendor or
transient guests so assessed to the Director. When a petition for reassessment
is filed, the Director shall assign a time and place for the hearing of same
and shall notify the petitioner thereof by registered or certified mail, but
the Director may continue the hearings from time to time if necessary.
   A penalty of fifteen percent shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Director may adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to assessments
made under this chapter.
   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment as
provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Director, together with
penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days after notice
of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either personally or by
registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.08   FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any taxes imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Director of Finance has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not
returned to the City;
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.09   TAXES PAID TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact taxes as required
by this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the taxes.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.10   VENDOR TO COLLECT TAXES; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact taxes as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the taxes levied pursuant to this chapter, or
make in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which
might imply that he is absorbing the taxes, or paying the taxes for the
transient guest by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price
including the taxes, or rebating the taxes in any other manner.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.11   REPORTS MUST BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer or employee of a corporation having
control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns,
shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed by this chapter,
or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or fraudulent return, report
or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of any false or fraudulent
return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive months or on three or more months within a twelve-
month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the taxes thereon; or if
any vendor authorized by the Director of Finance to file returns at less
frequent intervals fails, on two or more occasions within a twenty-four month
period, to file such returns when due or to pay the taxes due thereon, the
Director of Finance may require such vendor to furnish security in an amount
equal to the average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as
determined by the Director from a review of returns or other information
pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax
payment to be applied to pay the taxes due on subsequent returns, or a
corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Director, conditioned upon payment
of the taxes due with the returns from the vendor. The security must be filed
within ten days following the vendor's receipt of the notice from the Director
of its requirements.
   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to the
vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith
within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.12   PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit taxes due to
the City under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit taxes due. The sum
due for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. C41-76. Passed 5-17-76; Ord. C123-88. Passed 1-16-89.)
192.13   INTENT OF CHAPTER.

annual municipal income tax on income, qualifying wages, commissions and other
compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (b)   The annual tax is levied at a rate of two percent (2%). The tax is
levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving

commissions and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided
in Section
194.03 of this chapter and other sections as they may apply.
   (c)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
Chapter 194 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio
Constitution. The tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be
consistent with, the provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code (“ORC”)

2016. Taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2015 are subject to the

this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal

shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC. (Ord. C10-18.

deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            2.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to Grove City each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.   “Refundable credit" means the amount of Grove City income tax
that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   If, in addition to Grove City, a taxpayer has paid tax to other
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to Grove City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this subsection is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (e)   Domicile.
      (1)   A.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in Grove City for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in Grove City on
the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in Grove
City for all or part of the taxable year.
         B.   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
subsection (e)(1)A. if the individual establishes by a preponderance of the
evidence that the individual was not domiciled in Grove City for all or part of
the taxable year.
      (2)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in Grove City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be considered
include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
         B.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         C.   The address on the individual's driver's license;
         D.   The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
         E.   The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
         F.   Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         G.   The primary location at which the individual is an employee;
         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located; and/or
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with Grove City.
For the purposes of this subsection, an individual has one "contact period"
with Grove City if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of Grove City and while away overnight from that abode spends
at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two (2) consecutive days in
Grove City.
      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations authorized under Sections
194.22 and
194.26.
   (f)   Businesses. This subsection applies to any taxpayer engaged in a
business or profession in Grove City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in Grove City or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company,
or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under
Chapter 5745 of the ORC.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (f)(2) and (g), net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Grove City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in Grove
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Grove City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Grove City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
194.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Grove City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in subsection (f)(1) do
not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in Grove
City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of Grove City may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
194.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in subsection (f)(2)A., but only
by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by
Section
194.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in subsection (f)(2) nullifies or otherwise affects any
alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax Administrator or
otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and taxpayer before January
1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in subsection (f)(1)B., "wages, salaries, and other
compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to an
employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; or
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in subsection (f)(3)A.2., or a related member of such a vendor, customer,
client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in subsection (f)(3)A. or B. solely in order to
avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If the Tax
Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of subsection (f)(1)C. and except as provided in
subsection (g), receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed
shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets any of the following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within Grove City from
a stock of goods located within Grove City; or
            2.   The property is delivered within Grove City from a location
outside Grove City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within Grove City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion. (Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-
18.)
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Grove City to the extent that such services are performed in Grove City;
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in Grove City shall be sitused to Grove City;
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Grove City shall be sitused to Grove
City; and
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Grove City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Grove City.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Grove City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Grove City or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Grove City.
Grove City shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this subsection to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Grove City, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in Grove City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of Grove City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Grove City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under Grove City's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in subsections (f)(1) or (2),
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (g)   Net Profit Allocation.
      (1)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
194.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         D.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under subsection (g)(1)D.l., the reporting location in this state at
which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or periodically reports
during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under subsection (g)(1)D.1. or 2., the location that the taxpayer
otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting location,
provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and maintained in
the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the qualifying reporting
location designated for an employee or owner under this section at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this section to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of subsection (f) apply to such apportionment except as
otherwise provided in this section.
         A.   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this section in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         B.   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this section, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         C.   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election
applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business.
The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         D.   Nothing in this section prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this section after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in subsection
(f)(1), all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the election
described in subsection (g)(2):
         A.   For the purpose of subsection (f)(1)A., the average original cost
of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote employee or owner
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of subsection (f)(l)B., any wages, salaries, and
other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying remote
employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote
work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of subsection (f)(l)C., and notwithstanding
subsection (f)(4), any gross receipts of the business or profession from
services performed during the taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or
owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote work
location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this section prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in subsection (f)(2). However, a tax administrator shall not require
an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would require a
taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation solely
because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this
section is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
194.04 of this Chapter.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. C46-23. Passed 11-20-23.)
194.04   COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding provisions. Each employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer located or doing business in Grove City shall withhold an income tax from
the qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in Grove City.
Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
194.03 or subsections (b)(4) or (6), the tax shall be withheld at the rate of
two percent (2%) as specified in Section
194.03 of this chapter. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2), an employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax Administrator of Grove City
the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the income taxes
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer
according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Grove City in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand three
hundred and ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of
Grove City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
            Payment under subsection (b)(1)A. shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld. (Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under subsection (b)(1)A. of taxes required to be deducted and
withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator not later than
the last day of the month following the last day of each calendar quarter.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
         C.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(l)A. and B.,
taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted semimonthly to the
Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of Grove City in the preceding calendar year
exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars ($11,999.00), or
if in any month of the preceding calendar year exceeded one thousand dollars
($1,000.00). Payment under subsection (b)(1)C. shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than one of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen (15) days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth (15th) day of that month; or
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth (15th) day of a month and before the
first day of the immediately following month, the third (3rd) banking day after
the last day of the month.(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Grove City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this subsection does not affect an employer's,
agents, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
subsection shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Grove City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Grove City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Grove City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to Grove
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Grove City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Grove City during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         C.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee; and
         E.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Grove City income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
subsection, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
   (c)   Occasional Entrant - Withholding.
      (1)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   "Employer" includes a person that is a related member to or of an
employer.
         B.   “Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to subsection (c)(2)A.1. among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this subsection shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this subsection, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
subsection (c)(2)B., except that “location” shall be substituted for “municipal
corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that subsection.

         G.   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than
twenty (20) days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include
the home of an employee.
      (2)   A.   Subject to subsections (c)(3), (5) and (6), an employer is not
required to withhold Grove City income tax on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services in Grove City if the employee
performed such services in Grove City on twenty (20) or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one (1) of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in Grove
City;
            2.   The employee performed services at one (1) or more presumed
worksite locations in Grove City. For the purposes of this subsection,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in Grove City at which the employer provides or provided services that
can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more
than twenty (20) days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected
by the employer to last more than twenty (20) days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty (20) days;
            3.   The employee is a resident of Grove City and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
194.04; or
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of subsection (c)(2)A., an employee shall be
considered to have spent a day performing services in Grove City only if the
employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of the employer
in Grove City than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For the
purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a particular
location, the time spent performing one (1) or more of the following activities
shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal place of
work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in subsection
(c)(2)B.3., provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee does not
temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned, used, or
controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in subsection (c)(2)A. shall apply only if,
with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in that subsection,
the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages to that
municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in subsection (c)(4)B., if, during a
calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing personal
services in Grove City exceeds the twenty (20) day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Grove City for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Grove City.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Grove City
under subsection (c)(4)A. may elect to withhold tax for Grove City for the
first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in Grove City.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Grove City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
194.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to Grove
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of Grove City.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
       (6)   Subsections (c)(2)A. and (4) shall not apply to the extent that a
Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the manner
in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
194.04.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.05   ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual Grove City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
194.04 of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due Grove City.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Grove City income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Grove City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by Grove City, the return or notice required of that individual shall
be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (e)   Grove City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this subsection shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and, with
respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to support
the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files
the annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this subsection to the
Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business
Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Grove City to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under subsection (f)
apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under Section
5747.08(G) of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Grove City. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Grove City. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six (6) month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Grove City’s income tax
return. The extended due date of Grove City’s income tax return shall be the
fifteenth (15th) day of the tenth (10th) month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after
January 1, 2023, the extended due date of Grove City's income tax return for a
taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month
after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An
extension of time to file under this subsection is not an extension of the time
to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that
date.
         A.   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Grove City's income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six (6) month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six (6) month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Grove City income tax return.
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Grove City income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under Section 5747.08(G) of the ORC, a taxpayer
shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Grove City's
income tax return. The extended due date of Grove City's income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Grove City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
subsection, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under subsection (g)(2), (3), or (4), the tax administrator
shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to
the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before
the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
         A.   If a tax administrator violates subsection (g)(5), the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         B.   Subsection (g)(5) does not apply to an extension received under
subsection (g)(2) if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the
taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under subsection (g)(2) or failed to file for an extension under
subsection (g)(2)B.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in subsection (g) conflicts with
any provision in subsections (n), (o), (p) or (q), the provisions in
subsections (n), (o), (p) or (q) prevail. (Ord. C46-23. Passed 11-20-23.)
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Grove City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Grove City for a taxable
year pursuant to subsection (h)(1) shall file with Grove City an annual net
profit return under subsection (f)(3) of this section, unless the provisions of
subsection (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer with respect to Grove City for a taxable year if
both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with Grove City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location, as defined in subsection 194.04(c)(l)G.,
within Grove City.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in Grove City and does
not expect to be subject to Grove City’s income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Grove City. The affidavit also shall include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within Grove City, make any sales in Grove City, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by Grove City during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by Grove City for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with Grove City if such a registration is required by Grove City’s
resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in subsection (h)(3)B.
of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in subsection (h) of this section prohibits the tax
administrator from performing an audit of the person.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. (Ord. C10-18.
Passed 2-23-18.)
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the Grove City by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
194.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Grove City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Grove City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by Grove City to be filed in accordance with this
subsection shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Grove City, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Grove
City or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of Grove City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (m)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Grove City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (n)   Extension for service in or for the armed forces. Each member of the
national guard of any state and each member of a reserve component of the armed
forces of the United States called to active duty pursuant to an executive
order issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of
the United States, and each civilian serving as support personnel in a combat
zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces, may apply to the
Tax Administrator of Grove City for both an extension of time for filing of the
return and an extension of time for payment of taxes required by Grove City
during the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for One
Hundred and Eighty (180) days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the One Hundred and Eightieth (180th) day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred and eighty first (181st) day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this subsection are
not delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred and eighty
first (181st) day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under subsection (o)
(1) are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this subsection denies to any person described in
this subsection the application of subsections (n) and (o).
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted hereunder
shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the taxpayer
receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this subsection,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with subsection (p)
(2)A. are not delinquent during the extension period. Such taxes become
delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension period if the
taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under subsection (p)(2)A. in calculating the penalty or
interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which subsections (n), (o) or (p) applies to
a taxpayer, the provisions of subsections (o)(2) and (3), as applicable, apply
to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the spouse and the
taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (r)   Consolidated municipal income tax return. As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under subsection
(r)(l).
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one (1) member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Grove
City's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under subsection
(s)(2) or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under subsection (s)(l). The election to discontinue filing a
consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five (5) year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under subsections (s)(1) or (2) is binding on all
members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a municipal income
tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 194.80 of
this chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under subsection (s)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section 194.80 of this chapter is
terminated, a valid election made under section 194.86 of this chapter is
binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Grove City income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Grove City. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Grove City income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Grove City income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Grove City income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of the
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (v)(2), (3) and (4),
corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section 194.02, by substituting
“consolidated federal taxable income” for “federal taxable income” wherever
“federal taxable income” appears in that subsection and by substituting “an
affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s” wherever “a C
corporation’s” appears in that subsection.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Grove City income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section 194.02(c)(1) to the
extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income. (Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Grove City income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Sections 194.05(r) through (y),
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Grove City. If
the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Sections 194.05(r) through (y),
include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Grove City. If
the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject
to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits
that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Sections 194.05(r) through (y),
exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in
the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Grove City;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Grove City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Grove City income tax return shall
make the computations required under Sections 194.05(r) through (y) by
substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to" for "net
profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Grove City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Grove City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one (1) or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Grove City before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Grove City may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.06   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Grove City who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits of the resident or other compensation taxable under this chapter
may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to
the other municipality. Subject to subsection (c), the credit shall not exceed
the tax due Grove City under this chapter on the resident’s income earned in
the other municipality.
   (b)   Grove City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of Grove City who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71 or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of subsection (a), "the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits of the resident or other compensation" subject
to tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (d)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Grove City whose income subject
to the tax imposed by this chapter includes the resident’s distributive share
of the net profit of pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by the
resident, may claim a non-refundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of
municipal tax paid by the pass-through entities to that municipality. The
credit shall not exceed the lesser of:
      (1)   The tax due Grove City under this chapter on the aggregate
distributive share of net profit of pass-through entities subject to tax in
that municipality reduced by any net operating loss attributable to the
resident's ownership interest in a pass-through entity and generated in or
allocated to that municipality and further reduced by the aggregate net
operating loss of the resident, if any, generated in or allocated to that

194.07   ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for Grove City's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to Grove City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid
on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this subsection, "date
of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover,
the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
(12) months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
194.05(g) or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Grove City,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent
(22.5%) of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth (9th) month
after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent
(67.5%) of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability
for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth (12th) month of the taxable year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year. (Ord. C10-18. Passed
2-23-18.)
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month of
the year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall
be paid with the return in accordance with Section
194.05.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
194.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in subsection (e). The
amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
          C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
subsection (d) shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this
section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the
following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of Twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with Grove City under Section
194.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Grove City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15; Ord. C46-23. Passed 11-20-23.)
194.08   ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.09   REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
Section
194.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in subsection
(c)(3), the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
194.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in subsection (c) shall be considered to have been filed in a timely
manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day; or
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
194.18(a)(4).
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.10   SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with Grove City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Grove City as a
refund but is subject to the three (3) year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Grove City is subject to recovery by Grove City. If
Grove City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Grove City
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Grove City
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If Grove City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Grove
City's tax rate. However, if Grove City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to Grove City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued
during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Grove City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with Grove
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
194.12 have not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two (2) amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this subsection within the period prescribed by Section
194.11(d) for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that subsection if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that subsection. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by Grove City. A request filed under this subsection
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
194.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Grove City's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Grove City return showing income
subject to Grove City income tax based upon such final determination of federal
or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Grove City income
tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the
tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One (1) year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in subsection (a)(1)A. may be extended
at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent of the
employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. Any
extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in subsection (c).
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
194.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth (60th) day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board-of Tax Review, the
sixtieth (60th) day after the date on which the final determination of the
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
194.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Grove City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
194.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
194.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover Grove City income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.13   AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This section does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (b)   Subject to subsection (c), a copy of each assessment shall be served
upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by certified mail,
or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of the ORC. With the
permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator may
deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this section,
including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days after the
assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Grove City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty (60) days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
subsection (c)(1)A. is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that
the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the
Tax Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under subsection (c)
(1)A. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under this
subsection in accordance with subsection (d).
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
subsection (c) bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence
that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified mail was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this section, a person is
associated with an address at the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed
the assessment if, at that time, the person was residing, receiving legal
documents, or conducting business at the address; or if, before that time, the
person had conducted business at the address and, when the assessment was
mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate was conducting business at
the address. For the purposes of this section, a person's affiliate is any
other person that, at the time the assessment was mailed, owned or controlled
at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by voting rights, of the
addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in subsection (d)(1), and if that assessment is subject to collection and is
not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty (60) days after
the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Grove City official, or
the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this subsection prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
subsection (c)(1)B., including those on which a claim has been delivered for
collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the rules and regulations,
adopted pursuant to Sections 194.22 and 194.26, shall apply.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.15   ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Grove City that arises pursuant to Grove City's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Grove City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit Grove City from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.17   FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Grove City ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Grove City or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. C85-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
194.18   INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Applicable law" means this chapter, the resolutions, ordinances,
codes, directives, instructions, and rules adopted by Grove City provided they
impose or directly or indirectly address the levy, payment, remittance, or
filing requirements of Grove City.
      (2)   "Federal short-term rate" means the rate of the average market
yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

194.81   DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections

194.95 of this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the
use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC, unless
the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the ORC, in which case the definition in
that chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal
Revenue Code includes other laws of the United States related to federal income
taxes. If a term is defined in both this section and Section
194.01 of this chapter, the definition in this section shall control for all
uses of that term in Sections
194.80 through
194.95 of this chapter.
   As used in Sections
194.80 to

profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of Grove City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in Grove
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible

total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from

   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in subsection (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         A.   Separate accounting:

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by subsection (a) of Section
194.90 of this chapter.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section only by

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner’s determination was unreasonable.

City to the extent that such services are performed in Grove City.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of

      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Grove City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Grove City.
   (e)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to Grove City if the
real estate is located in Grove City. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to Grove City based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in Grove City to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under subsections (c)(12)L. and (c)(35) of Section
194.02 of this chapter, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to Grove City. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to Grove City any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation under subsections (c)(12)L. and (c)(35) of Section
194.02 of this chapter.
         This subsection applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment

section for the purposes of that subsection or subsection (b) of this section,

certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to Grove
City, based on amounts reported on annual returns and declarations of estimated
tax under Sections

net of any audit adjustments made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for
the calendar month preceding the month in which the certification is made. Not
later than the fifth day of each month, the director shall provide for payment
of the amount certified to Grove City from the municipal income tax fund, plus
a pro rata share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund since the
previous payment under this section. Grove City’s share of such earnings shall
equal the proportion that Grove City’s certified tax payment is of the total
taxes certified to all municipal corporations in that quarter. All investment
earnings on money in the municipal income tax fund shall be credited to that
fund.
   (b)   If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to Grove City under this section for a taxable year
exceeds the amount payable to Grove City under Sections 194.80 to 194.95 of
this chapter after accounting for amounts remitted with the annual return and
as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall proceed according to Section 5703.77
of the ORC.

that made estimated payments that are attributable to Grove City and the amount
of each such taxpayer’s estimated payment.

commissioner, in a format prescribed by the commissioner, the name and mailing
address of up to two persons to whom Grove City requests that the commissioner
send the information described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The
commissioner shall not provide such information to any person other than a
person who is designated to receive the information under this section and who
is employed by the Grove City or by a tax administrator, as defined in Section
718.01 of the ORC, that administers Grove City’s income tax, except as may
otherwise be provided by law.
   (e)   (1)   The tax commissioner may adopt rules that further govern the
terms and conditions under which tax returns filed with the commissioner under
this chapter, and any other information gained in the performance of the
commissioner’s duties prescribed by this chapter related to taxpayers that have
apportioned net profits to Grove City under Section
194.82 of this chapter, shall be available for inspection by properly
authorized officers, employees, or agents of Grove City.
            The City expects that the tax commissioner will, pursuant to this
subsection and Section 718.84(E) of the ORC, provide tax returns and other
information it receives in the performance of its administration of Grove
City’s municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election under
Section
194.80 of this chapter so that the Tax Administrator may review these returns
and information, as well as the information received pursuant to subsections
(b) and (c) of this section, and, at the Tax Administrator’s discretion, refer
the taxpayer for audit by the tax commissioner under subsection (f) of this
section.
      (2)   As used in this subsection, “properly authorized officer, employee,
or agent” means an officer, employee, or agent of Grove City who is authorized
by charter or ordinance of Grove City to view or possess information referred
to in Section

of Section
194.91 of this chapter or subsections (b) or (c) of this section. Grove City
discovers that it has additional information in its possession that could
result in a change to a taxpayer’s tax liability, Grove City may refer the
taxpayer to the tax commissioner for an audit. Such referral shall be made on a
form prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that
forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)   Upon receipt of a referral under subsection (f)(1) of this section,
the commissioner shall review the referral and may conduct an audit of the
taxpayer that is the subject of the referral based on the information in the

forming the sole basis upon which the commissioner may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer.
      (4)   A.   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit Grove City from filing
a writ of mandamus if duty as the administrator of the tax levied by Grove
City.
         B.   In accordance with Section 1.47 of the ORC, Grove City intends
for subsection (f)(4)A. to be effective, and thus intends for subsection (f)
(4)A. to serve as acknowledgement that a de facto fiduciary duty exists.
         C.   The following actions shall be presumptive breaches of the tax
commissioner’s fiduciary duty:
            1.   The approval of an alternative apportionment method under
subsection
194.82(b)(1) of this chapter by the tax commissioner primarily for reasons
related to economic development, job creation, or improvement of the business
climate without the expressed written consent of the Tax Administrator.
            2.   The failure to perform an audit or pursue an audit issue
primarily for reasons related to economic development, job creation, or
improvement of the business climate without the expressed written consent of
the Tax Administrator.
            3.   Any other actions that the courts have held to be
presumptively invalid when performed by a fiduciary.
         D.   Non-presumptive breaches of the tax commissioner’s fiduciary duty
are to be evaluated without application of the maxim expressio unius est
exclusion alterius.
      (5)   If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the Tax Administrator under this section, or upon auditing the taxpayer does
not adequately address and resolve the audit issues raised by the Tax
Administrator as determined solely by the Tax Administrator, the City reserves
its right to pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to
ensure that the correct liability as determined by the Tax Administrator has
been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

must be provided, any event attaching a penalty for failure to provide such
information shall be extended accordingly.
   (d)   The tax commissioner may modify the web portal created pursuant to

with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under subsection (b)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under subsection (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to Grove
City’s income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
194.80 of this chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under subsection
(s)(l) or (2) of Section
194.05 of this chapter is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
194.80 of this chapter is terminated, a valid election made under this section
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm’s length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to
Grove City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all subsequent taxable
years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (d)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and
(e)(4) of this section. corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall
compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
194.81 of this chapter, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income”
for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that
subsection and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C
corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that subsection.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under subsection (b) of Section
194.81 of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.82 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to Grove City. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
194.82 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to Grove City. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
194.82 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to Grove City;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Grove City taxation
as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter on the basis of the entity’s net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
194.82 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter or Chapter 5703 of the ORC to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
194.87   FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
194.80 of this chapter fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by Section
5703.47 of the ORC from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or
until the date an assessment is issued under Section
194.90 of this chapter, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
194.88   DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Combined tax liability” means the total amount of a taxpayer’s
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   “Estimated taxes” means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer’s combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in subsection (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   A.   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         B.   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in
subsection (b) of Section
194.85 of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
Section
5703.47 of the ORC upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in subsection (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter and shall be credited and distributed to Grove City in
accordance with Section
194.83 of this chapter.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
194.89   ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter or Chapter 5703 of the ORC, the following penalties
shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars
($25.00) per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a
month elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and
the date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance,
under this subsection shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         A.   For each of the first two failures, five percent (5%) of the
amount required to be reported on the return;
         B.   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent (10%) of
the amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
194.80 of this chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid
under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) may
be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or one hundred percent (100%) of the tax
required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
194.91 of this chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or one hundred percent (100%) of the claim.
Any penalty imposed under this subsection, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
194.90 of this chapter without regard to any time limitation for the assessment
imposed by subsection (a) of that section.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter and shall be credited and distributed to Grove City in
the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required to be
distributed to Grove City under Section
194.83 of this chapter.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
194.90 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner’s possession.
      The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
194.91 of this chapter for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or
limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject
to assessment as required by Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in Section 5703.37 of the ORC. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (b)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer’s
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under Section
5703.60 of the ORC.
   (c)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner’s entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer’s statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
      Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled “special
judgments for municipal income taxes,” and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
      If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of
the ORC from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under Section
131.02 of the ORC, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of the
assessment is certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum
prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the ORC from the date of certification until
the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner
as the tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, all money
collected under this section shall be credited to the municipal income tax fund
and distributed to Grove City based on the assessment issued under this
section.
      (2)   The attorney general may assess collection costs as authorized
under section 109.08,109.081, or 131.02 of the Revised Code on amounts
collected under this section, which shall be credited to the attorney general
claims fund created under section 109.081 of the Revised Code.
   (e)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by subsection (c) of this
section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer
assessed or the taxpayer’s legal representative in the manner provided in
Section 5703.37 of the ORC within five days of the filing of the entry with the
clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the
taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with
subsection (b) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to
the commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of
the assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice
the commissioner’s consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition. If
upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
194.91 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18; Ord. C46-23. Passed 11-20-23.)
194.91   REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
subsection (a) of Section
194.90 of this chapter. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars ($10.00) and not less
than that claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director
of budget and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax
refund fund created in Section 5703.052 of the ORC. If the amount is greater
than ten dollars ($10.00) but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall
proceed in accordance with Section 5703.70 of the ORC.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify Grove City of the amount refunded to the taxpayer attributable to
Grove City, which shall be deducted from Grove City’s next distribution under
Section
194.83 of this chapter.
   (c)   Any portion of a refund determined under subsection (b) of this
section that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall
bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the ORC
from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the refund is
paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid
at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment
until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
194.92   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
194.80 of this chapter and used to determine the tax due under Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
Internal Revenue Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer’s tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
194.90 of this chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal tax return.
   (c)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this subsection within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
194.91 of this chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this subsection shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer’s federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
194.91 of this chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal income tax return.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)
194.93   EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
194.80 to
194.95 of this chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner’s inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by Grove
City.
   (c)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person’s possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This subsection does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. C10-18. Passed 2-23-18.)

303.08   IMPOUNDING OF VEHICLES; REDEMPTION.
   Police officers are authorized to provide for the removal and impounding of
a vehicle under the following circumstances:
   (a)   When any vehicle is left unattended upon any street, bridge or
causeway and is so illegally parked so as to constitute a hazard or obstruction
to the normal movement of traffic, or so as to unreasonably interfere with
street cleaning or snow removal operations.
   (b)   When any vehicle or "abandoned junk motor vehicle," as defined in Ohio
R.C. 4513.63, is left on private property for more than 72 consecutive hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 consecutive hours or longer, without notification
to the Police Chief of the reasons for leaving such vehicle in such place.
Prior to disposal of an "abandoned junk motor vehicle," as defined in Ohio R.C.
4513.63, it shall be photographed by a law enforcement officer.
   (c)   When any vehicle has been stolen or operated without the consent of
the owner.

thereof has failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required.
   The Police Department shall forthwith notify the registered vehicle owner of
the fact of such removal and impounding, reasons therefor and the place of
storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded vehicle shall appear at the
Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence of identity and ownership or
right to possession. Prior to issuance of a release form, the claimant, owner
or operator shall either pay the amount due for any fines for violations on
account of which such vehicle was impounded or, as the court may require, post
a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to answer to such violations.
The pound operator shall release such vehicle upon the receipt of the release
form and payment of all towage and storage charges.
   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place of
storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of storage, by the
owner or operator, shall constitute prima-facie evidence that it was so removed
by the owner or operator.
303.09   LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle, as

without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, the fact that a motor vehicle has been
so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
   (c)   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61 and
4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
   (d)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the Municipality
from such disposal.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10   LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   (1)   For purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means any
motor vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is
left uncovered in the open on private property for more than 72 hours with the
permission of the person having the right to possession of the property, except
if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility
licensed under the authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise
regulated under authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on
which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by
any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the
possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a
bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's
vehicle.
      (2)   The Municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector's vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
Municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, and
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The Police Chief, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11   VEHICLE TRESPASS.

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of
the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code
is substantially equivalent.
(ORC 4510.05)

313.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right- of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street, after
stopping. The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the provisions
that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted to enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow signal indication, after stopping. The right to proceed
with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow and
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
313.04   LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNALS OVER INDIVIDUAL LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
313.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.
(ORC 4511.14)

   (a)   (1)   No person shall place, maintain, or display upon or in view of
any highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to
be, is an imitation of, or resembles a traffic-control device or railroad sign
or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from
view or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a
violation of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct, the two offenses are allied

   (d)   Evidence; Tests; Immunity.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under R.C. § 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person's opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., C., D. and
E. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence
in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney or
agent immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. The person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician or
chemist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in
addition to any administered at the request of a police officer, and shall be
so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a police officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
C., D., E., F., G., H. I or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section or
for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those
divisions, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by
the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division
that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who

(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F)) (Ord. C50-94. Passed 7-5-94.)
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral
fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine if arrested
for a violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A)
or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other
municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but
the officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the
person refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever
reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical
test of the person's whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall
also advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense. Divisions (g)(3)
and (g)(4) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or
tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting
officer shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid,
or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other

guilty to a violation of division (a) of this section or an equivalent offense
that a subsequent violation of this section or an equivalent offense that

pregnancy may result in the person being guilty of aggravated vehicular
homicide under R.C. § 2903.06. The court may warn the person of the applicable
penalties for that violation under R.C. §§ 2903.06 and 2929.142.
      (10)   As used in division (h) of this section, “electronic monitoring”

grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under R. C. § 4510.022. If the court grants

      (3)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

Chapter 3793 by the Director of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (k)   If a person whose driver's or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited

from the immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization
ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.

is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

the offender may be ordered pursuant to §
501.99(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up

339.01   OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLE OPERATION ON STATE ROUTES; STATE
PERMIT.
   (a)   State regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
         (R.C. § 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of

such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed
or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the
public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the
posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a
roadway or road structure.

violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty prescribed by Section
303.99.

501.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09   ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
501.10   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13   RIGHT TO APPEAL; CERTAIN GENERAL OFFENSES ORDERS.
   (a)   Whenever a person has been cited with certain Codified Ordinance
violations that require notice to be given to the offender prior to enforcement
of such violation(s) (i.e. 505.01, 521.11, 521.18, 523.02, 523.03, 523.04,
543.02, 543.03), then the notice shall include the offender’s right to file an
appeal to the alleged violation(s).
   (b)   The petition to appeal must be in writing and must be filed no later
than five days after notice, referenced in division (a) of this section, has
been served upon the alleged offender. The petition to appeal must be filed
with the office of the Director of Public Safety within the five day period.
   (c)   The Director of Public Safety, or his or her designee, shall conduct a
hearing on the appeal. The procedure to be followed, including notice of
hearing, and appeal rights from the hearing, shall be the same as specified in
Ohio R.C. 119.07 through 119.12, inclusive.
(Ord. C11-97. Passed 2-3-97.)
501.99   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section 533.99 of this code or Ohio R.C.
2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this section and unless another term
is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a
jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 533.99 of this Code or Ohio R.C.
2929.22 or when a jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a
misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either
of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if
the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the offender to any
community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions
authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the offender
violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private person
or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that comprises
the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing court or to
the department of probation or probation officer with general control and
supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or entity
reports the violation to the department of probation or probation officer, the
department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:

for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,

by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring

         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County’s General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund . The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (g)   Organizational Penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four
thousand dollars ($4,000.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
         F.   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
         G.   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

   (f)   No person who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more
violations of division (d) of this section involving the same dog and no owner,

(ORC 955.22)
   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
505.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound at the
owner’s expense.

county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (l)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that R.C. § 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that §
505.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part
of the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability
insurance required under division (f)(1) of this section in an amount,
exclusive of interest and costs, that equals or exceeds $100,000. Until the
court makes a final determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a
violation of division (d) of this section and at the discretion of the dog

division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the

county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security
provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the

of the City. The alarm holder shall pay the City a service charge for a false
alarm, which shall be as follows:
Residential Alarm Holder
Number of False Alarms Per Year Amount of Penalty per Occurrence
1 - 3                           $0.00
4 - 7                           50.00

13 - more                       200.00
 
   (b)   This section imposes strict liability for all false alarms. Upon
determination that the alarm is false, as defined by this chapter, then the
issue of fact is conclusive and fault, except as may be exempted by this
chapter, is not a defense to the assessments stated by this section.
(Ord. C64-94. Passed 9-19-94.)
   (c)   Notice of False Alarms.
      (1)   Upon information of a false alarm as defined in this chapter, on
land within the City, the Director of Public Safety and/or his or her designee,
shall cause a written notice to be served upon the owner, lessee, agent or
tenant having charge of such land notifying him or her of the false alarm and
service charges that may be due. Service charges are due within thirty (30)
days of receipt of the notice required herein.
      (2)   For residential alarm holders: Such notice shall be served by
delivering the same personally to such person within the corporate limits of
the City, by leaving such notice at the residence or by sending the same by
certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the residence or to the
address listed in the Franklin County tax records. If the owner or other person
having charge of such land is a nonresident whose address is known, such notice
shall be sent to his or her address by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by regular postal service if such certified mail has been refused
by the addressee.
      (3)   For business alarm holders: Such notice shall be served by
delivering the same personally to the business within the corporate limits of
the City, by leaving such notice at the place of business or by sending the
same by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the business, or
by regular postal service if such certified mail has been refused by the
business.
   (d)   Failure to Pay Service Charges. Should such account remain unpaid
after the thirtieth day after being notified in writing of the service charge
by the Director of Public Safety and/or his or her designee, such expenses
shall be certified by the Director of Finance to the County Auditor and placed
upon the tax duplicate for collection as a special assessment and thereupon
shall be collected as other taxes and assessments. Such expenses shall include
any administrative costs established by the Director of Public Safety plus any
fines and/or costs.
   (e)   The recovery of service charges by the City pursuant to this section
is a remedy in addition to any other penalty that may be imposed.
(Ord. C16-14. Passed 4-21-14.)
524.05   DUTY OF ALARM HOLDER OR ALARM SYSTEM OWNER.
   (a)   It shall be the sole responsibility of the alarm holder or alarm
system owner to select proper equipment and qualified installers to assure
proper installation of any alarm system, and properly service and maintain the
alarm system at all times. No claim of defective installation or age of the
alarm system shall be a defense for a “false alarm” service charge assessed. It
is the intent of this section to impose strict liability for any “false alarm”
upon the alarm holder to this section and any or all sections of this chapter.
   (b)   No alarm holder or alarm system owner or alarm system lessee shall
fail to promptly respond to a request by public safety personnel to disconnect
or reset an alarm. Any person responsible for the alarm who fails to respond
within a reasonable time period, upon receiving notice by public safety
personnel, is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for the first offense. Whoever
violates this section more than once in a calendar year, defined as January 1st
to December 31st, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (c)   No liability will be imposed upon public safety personnel or the City
as a result of rendering the system inoperable, nor shall there be any
liability for loss or damage to the premises, contents, or business
interruption that may occur as a direct result or proximate cause of such
action.
(Ord. C64-94. Passed 9-19-94.)
524.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   No alarm holder shall allow more than three chargeable false alarms,
as defined by Section
524.01(d), to be transmitted to public safety personnel during the immediately
preceding one year calendar period. An alarm will be classified as false if the
responding public safety personnel see no evidence of fire, robbery, burglary,
vandalism, unauthorized intrusion or medical emergency.
   (b)   If the alarm holder proves that the alarm was caused by an event not
reasonably foreseeable and which could not have been prevented by the proper
adjustment or pre-setting of the sensor threshold, the alarm will be designated
a nonchargeable false alarm. Such evidence shall be presented to the Director
of Public Safety or his or her designee, within 14 days of the false alarm.
Failure to provide the evidence in a timely manner shall exclude any
consideration of the evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor in addition to any other fine or service charge provided by this
chapter.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio

this section.

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal

determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. C65-72. Passed 10-2-72.)

contract the buyer or seller in a home solicitation sale may revoke an offer or
promise to purchase, cancel a contract or rescind a consummated sale and
purchase until midnight of the third calendar day after the day on which the

consummates a sale and purchase.
   (b)   Cancellation occurs when the buyer gives written notice of
cancellation to the seller at the address stated in the agreement, contract or
offer to purchase. Notice of cancellation given by the buyer need not take any
particular form and is sufficient if it indicates by any form of written
expression the intention of the buyer not to be bound by the home solicitation
sale.
   (c)   Notification by mail shall be considered given at the time mailed;
notification by telegram shall be considered given at the time filed for
transmission; and notification by other writing shall be considered given at

performance of services before the buyer gives notice of cancellation and in
the case of goods, that the goods cannot be returned to the seller in
substantially as good condition as when received by the buyer.
   (e)   If goods are to be returned to the seller, the buyer shall tender
delivery thereof at the location where the seller made delivery to the buyer.
If the seller or creditor does not take possession of the property within ten
days after tender by the customer, ownership of the property vests in the
customer without obligation on his part to pay for it, provided the buyer has
afforded to the seller reasonable time and access to take possession.
   (f)   The right to cancel granted herein may not be waived by the parties
either by express or implied agreement. Except as provided in subsection (d)
herein, receipt of goods or services shall not be construed as affecting the
right to cancel in any way.
(Ord. C65-72. Passed 10-2-72.)
715.04   CONTENTS OF HOME SOLICITATION SALE CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.
   In a home solicitation sale unless the goods or services are provided as set

passenger disembarks. The charge to each passenger shall be subject to any
mutual arrangement among the passengers provided the total charge paid by the
party is consistent with the meter charge as shown at the final destination.

way, or who has or seeks to have, a system located in any rights-of-way, shall
apply for and obtain a Certificate of Registration pursuant to this Chapter.
Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system without a Certificate of
Registration, including persons operating under a permit, license or franchise
issued by the City prior to the effective date of this Chapter, shall apply for
and obtain a Certificate of Registration from the City within ninety (90) days
of September 1, 2000, unless exempted by subsection (d) of this Section.
Applications will consist of providing the application information set forth in
Section
907.06 and as reasonably required by the Director of Public Service.
   (c)   No Construction Without Certificate of Registration. Following the
effective date of this Chapter, no person shall construct or perform any work
on or in, or use any system or any part thereof located on or in, any rights-
of-way without first obtaining a Certificate of Registration. For the purposes
of this Section only, a person with a system in place at the time of the
effective date of this Chapter shall not be considered immediately in violation

Certificate of Registration: the City; the County; cable television operators
for the limited purpose of providing only cable television service and
operating pursuant to a valid cable television franchise; resellers of services
that do not own any system or facilities in the rights-of-way.
   (e)   Systems in Place Without a Certificate of Registration. Beginning one
year after the effective date of this Chapter, any system or part of a system
found in a rights-of-way for which a Certificate of Registration has not been
obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the

equity, including but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of
the facilities and/or non-complying portion of such system; and/or prosecuting
the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing facilities to be placed in the rights-of-way,
the City is not liable for any damages caused thereby to any provider's
facilities that are already in place. No provider is entitled to rely on the
provisions of this Chapter as creating a special duty to any provider.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.03   DISCONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS, ABANDONED AND UNUSED FACILITIES.
   (a)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing operation of any
system in the City shall:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the provider's
obligations for its system in the rights-of-way under this Chapter and any
other chapters in the Codified Ordinances or other laws have been lawfully
assumed by another applicant and/or provider; or
      (2)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner that
promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to
efficiently and economically utilize limited rights-of-way capacity. The
proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Service; or
      (3)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The proposal must be approved by the Director of Public Service; or
      (4)   Completely remove its entire system within a reasonable amount of
time and in a manner acceptable to the City; or
      (5)   Submit to the City, in good faith and within a reasonable amount of
time, and in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for
transferring ownership of its facilities to the City. If a provider proceeds
under this clause, the City may, at its option:
         A.   Purchase the facilities; or
         B.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been provided pursuant to
907.21(b), require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the City for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
   (b)   Facilities of a provider who fails to comply with this Section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to: abating the
nuisance; or taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the
requirements of Ohio .R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or requiring removal of the
facilities by the provider or by the provider's surety. If the City determines
to require a provider to remove unused facilities in any rights-of-way, the
City shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this removal occur in
conjunction with other scheduled excavation of the rights-of-way. If the City
abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to recover its costs to
abate said nuisance, including but not limited to, those methods set forth in
Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.04   NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights-of-way. A Certificate of Registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with this Chapter. The rights to occupy the right-of-way itself may
not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers
may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-way so long as each
such provider complies with the provisions of this Chapter. Collocating
providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A Certificate
of Registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or
pole attachment agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of
others, including the City's facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not
prevent a provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long
as the sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the
provisions of this Chapter. A Certificate of registration does not excuse a
provider from complying with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable
Law.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.05   OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)

contribute to the health, safety, and welfare of the City and its citizens.
      (2)   Whether issuing of the Certificate of Registration will be
consistent with this Chapter.
      (3)   Whether applicant has submitted a complete application and has
secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law in order to
construct and operate a system in the manner proposed by the applicant;
      (4)   whether the applicant is delinquent on any taxes or other
obligations owed to the City or Franklin County or State of Ohio;

907.07   REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Reporting Obligations of Providers. Each provider shall at the time of
initial application, using its best efforts, by January 1st of each following
year, file a Construction and Major Maintenance Plan with the Department of
Public Service. Such Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall be provided
for all geographical areas requested by the Director of Public Service, up to
and including the entire geographical area of City. It shall be submitted using
a format(s) mutually agreeable to the provider and the City and shall contain
the information determined by the Director of Public Service to be necessary to
facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in
the rights-of-way. The Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall include,
but not be limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated Construction
or Major Maintenance projects for the next calendar year; if none are scheduled
or anticipated then the Plan should so state.
   (b)   Mapping Data.
      (1)   Upon application for a Certificate of Registration, a provider
shall provide the City with information regarding the location of its
facilities in the right-of-way in the most advanced mapping format and in as
much detail as currently available to the provider. Following that initial
provision of information and upon the reasonable request of the Director of
Public Service, which request shall not occur more than once annually, every
provider shall provide to the City, in the most advanced mapping format and in
as much detail as currently available to the provider, all location information
for all facilities which it owns or over which it has control and which are
located in any rights-of-way. All such information as described above shall be
provided for the geographical area (up to and including the entire geographic
area of the City), with the specificity as requested by the Director of Public
Service and in a format(s) mutually acceptable to the provider and the City.
Submission of this information is anticipated to be required beginning January
1, 2001.
      (2)   The Director of Public Service shall in the future adopt
specifications and further define the mapping data requirement(s) under this
Section. In each instance a provider shall be served with a copy of the
specifications by regular U.S. mail to the company representative identified in
Section
907.06(b)(2) and in accordance with Section
907.23(d); provided, however, that failure to actually receive such notice
shall not in any way affect the validity or enforceability of the
specifications.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.08   COMPENSATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   Compensation. As compensation for the City's costs to administer this
Chapter and the rights-of-way and for each Certificate of Registration issued
pursuant to this Chapter, every provider or any person operating a system shall
pay to the City registration maintenance fees determined as follows:
      (1)   Providers utilizing equal to or greater than thirty (30) miles of
right-of-way within the City shall pay a fee of four thousand dollars ($4,000)
per year.
      (2)   Providers utilizing less than thirty (30) miles of right-of-way
within the City shall pay a fee of two thousand dollars ($2,000) per year.
      (3)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive franchises and
compensating the City under other mechanisms shall not be required to
contribute to the recovery of rights-of- way costs as defined by this Chapter
with the exception of permit costs.
   (b)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in advance by
January 1st of each calendar year. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid
in full for the first year of the registration as a condition of the
Certificate of Registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the
effective date of the Certificate of Registration to the end of the calendar
year if less than one (1) full year. Payment of any and all registration
maintenance fees shall be waived until January 1, 2001.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of City property as a result of a
provider's use or occupation of the rights-of- way, the provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to this Chapter and shall not be considered an
offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and charges listed in this Chapter. The
Registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in this Chapter, or as required by
applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, permit fees and fees to
obtain space on City- owned poles are not waived and remain applicable.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the City by January 31, a monthly late charge of
one percent (1%) of the unpaid balance shall be paid by the provider for each
month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the City of any
registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
City may have for additional sums payable.
   (f)   Costs of Publication. A provider shall assume publication costs of up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000) associated with its Certificate of
Registration that may be required by law.

from or submitted to any municipal, county, state or federal agency or official
(and any response thereto submitted by or received by a provider), and any
other information or report reasonably related to a provider's obligations
under this Chapter which in any way materially effects the operation of the
system or a provider's representations and warranties set forth herein, but not
including tax returns or other filings which are confidential. Upon request, a

under this Chapter, its business and operations with respect to the system or
its operation, in such form and containing such information as the City shall
specify. Such information or report shall be accurate and complete and supplied
within fifteen (15) days.
   (b)   Confidentiality. All information submitted to the City that is
considered trade secret and/or proprietary information must be clearly marked
as such when submitted. The City shall exercise all reasonable protection so as
not to publicly disclose to any third party proprietary information unless
required by law.
   (c)   Provider's Expense. All reports and records required under this
Chapter shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider, except as
otherwise provided in this Chapter.
   (d)   Right of Inspection and Audit. The City's designated representatives
shall have the right to inspect, examine, or audit during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice to a provider under the circumstances, all
documents, records, or other information which pertain to a provider and its
operation of a system or its obligation under this ordinance. All such
documents shall be made available within the City or in such other place that
the City may agree upon in writing in order to facilitate said inspection,
examination, or audit; provided, however, that if such documents are located
outside of the City, then a provider shall pay the reasonable expenses incurred

and third parties), arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting from
the act or omissions of such provider, its agents, employees, and/or
subcontractors, in the performance of activities pursuant to such Certificate
of Registration, no matter how, or to whom, such loss may occur. In any event,
all persons using or occupying the rights-of-way agree to defend, indemnify,
and hold the City harmless as set forth above as a condition of their use or
occupancy of the rights-of-way.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.12   LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this Chapter, and the remedy
of specific performance, which may be enforced in a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Director of Public Service may assess an additional penalty
of civil forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of this Chapter.
Such penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the City, in the amount of
five hundred dollars ($500) per twenty-four (24) hour day of violation and any
subsequent portion of a day less than twenty four (24) hours in length. Prior
to assessing such penalty, the Director of Public Service shall provide written
notice to the provider detailing the failure to comply with a specific
provision of this Chapter. The notice shall indicate that the penalty shall be
assessed in fifteen (15) calendar days after service of the notice if
compliance is not achieved. If a provider desires to challenge the penalty,
provider shall request a hearing before the Mayor within ten (10) days of
service of the notice. The hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the
provider's request. If provider requests such hearing before the Mayor, the
penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if, after the hearing, the
Mayor determines that provider failed to comply with the specific provision of
this Chapter referenced in the notice, the penalty shall be assessed starting
fifteen (15) calendar days after service of the notice referenced in this
Section and continuing for each day thereafter until compliance is achieved.
The determination of the Mayor shall be final.

907.13   TERMINATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (a)   The Director of Public Service shall give written notice of default to
a provider if it is determined that a provider has:
      (1)   Violated any material provision or requirement of the issuance or
acceptance of a Certificate of Registration or any law of the City, state, or
federal government; or
      (2)   Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of the issuance of
a Certificate of Registration or the acceptance of it; or
      (3)   Practiced any fraud or deceit upon City; or
      (4)   Made a material misrepresentation of fact in its application for a
Certificate of Registration.
   (b)   If a provider fails to cure a default within thirty (30) calendar days
after such notice is served by the City, then such default shall be a material
breach and City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity
to terminate the Certificate of Registration. If the Director of Public Service
decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be
followed:
      (1)   City shall serve a provider with a written notice of the reason or
cause for proposed termination and shall allow a provider a minimum of ten (10)
calendar days to cure its breach.
      (2)   If the provider fails to cure within ten (10) calendar days, the
Director of Public Service may declare the Certificate of Registration
terminated.
      (3)   The provider shall have ten (10) calendar days to appeal the
termination to the Mayor. All such appeals shall be in writing. If the Mayor
determines there was not a breach, then the Mayor shall overturn the decision
of the Director of Public Service. Otherwise, the Mayor shall affirm the
decision of the Director of Public Service to terminate. The determination of
the Mayor shall be final.

a distinct and separate offense. Each and every day any violation of this
Chapter continues shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.
   (d)   No person shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
Each and every failure to comply shall be deemed a distinct and separate
offense. Each and every day any violation of this Chapter continues shall
constitute a distinct and separate offense.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.15   PEG REQUIREMENTS FOR OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS.
   Any provider that receives a certificate from the FCC to provide open video

that operates an open video system shall comply with all applicable laws and
FCC rules and regulations including those regarding support for public,
educational, and governmental access ("PEG").
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.16   TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RENEWAL.
   (a)   Transfer Approval Required. A Certificate of Registration shall not be
assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, without requesting,
through the Mayor, the consent of the City. Any request for assignment or
transfer shall include a completed copy of any application documents required
by the PUCO or FCC for such an assignment or transfer. If the City should
object to such assignment or transfer, it shall serve the provider with notice
of the objection within thirty (30) days following receipt of the provider's
request. If no objection is served upon the provider within thirty (30) days of
the City's receipt of the initial assignment or transfer request, the City
shall be deemed to have provided their consent to the requested assignment or
transfer by operation of law.
   (b)   Certificate of Registration and Assignee/Transferee Signature
Required. In no event shall a transfer or assignment of ownership or control be
ultimately acceptable to the City without transferee or assignee requesting and
being issued a replacement Certificate of Registration with ninety (90) days of
transfer or assignment.
   (c)   Renewal of Certificate of Registration. A provider shall request
renewal of a Certificate of Registration in writing at least six (6) months

required.
   (c)   Issuance of Construction Permit; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this Chapter and the construction permit process,
the Director of Public Service shall issue a construction permit subject to the
provisions of this Chapter.
      (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the
construction permit and the performance of the permittee thereunder in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the structural
integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other
users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (d)   Construction Permit Fees. The Director of Public Service shall, after
providing notice to and seeking input from all providers with systems in the
City right-of-way, develop and maintain a schedule of permit fees in an amount
sufficient to recover the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
rights-of-way that will result from the construction to take place thereon.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
Section means the accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way caused by
construction in or disturbance of the rights-of-way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such rights-of-way earlier than would be required if the
construction did not occur. No construction permit shall be issued without
payment of construction permit fees except to the City or County, which shall
be exempt. Construction permit fees that were paid for a permit that the City
has revoked due to breach are not refundable.
   (e)    Joint Applications. Applicants are encouraged to make joint
application for construction permits to work in the rights-of-way at the same
place and time. Joint applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
construction permit fees.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.18   CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Technical Information Required. Prior to commencement of any initial
construction of facilities in the rights-of-way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like facilities only, a construction permittee shall
provide technical information about the proposed route of construction. The
technical information required shall consist of, at minimum, completion of the
following tasks:
      (1)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
      (2)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
      (3)   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the rights-of-way along the proposed system
route. Upon request of the Director of Public Service, a permittee shall also
record and identify the general location of all other facilities in the rights-
of-way along the proposed system route. For the purposes of this Section,
general location shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the rights-of-
way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the
rights-of-way.
      (4)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the tasks
described in this section on the permittee's proposed system route maps,
construction plans, plan sheets, and computer aided drafting and design (CADD)
files, or other data files in a mutually agreeable format compatible with that
used by the City.
      (5)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A construction permittee shall not excavate more than a
three (3) foot by three (3) foot square hole in the rights-of-way to complete
this task.
      (6)   Plot, incorporate, and reconcile the data obtained by completion of
the tasks described in Section
907.18(a)(5) with the updated system route maps, construction plans and CADD
files or other data files in a mutually agreeable format as described in
Section
907.18(a)(4).
      (7)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this Section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
   (b)   Copy to City. Upon completion of the tasks described in Section
907.18(a), the construction permittee shall plot and incorporate the data on
the construction permittee's proposed system route maps, construction plans,
plan sheets, and CADD files, or other data files in a format compatible with
that used by the City and deliver a copy to the Department of Public Service.
   (c)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this Section shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering
that is approved by the City or may be performed by the construction permittee,
at the discretion of the Director of Public Service, if the construction
permittee is qualified to complete the project itself.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The construction permittee shall bear the cost of
compliance with Sections
907.18(a) through
907.18(c) of this Chapter.
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter,
or unless the Director of Public Service waives any of the requirements of this
Section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a construction permittee shall
be required to submit a written construction schedule to the City ten (10)
working days before commencing any work in or about the rights-of-way and,
shall further notify the City not less than two (2) working days in advance of
any excavation in the rights- of-way. This Section shall apply to all
situations with the exception of circumstances under Section
907.20(d)(1) (emergency situations).
   (f)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future
City and County plans for public improvements, development projects which have
been determined to be in the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment of providers.
      (3)   Should it be determined by the City that any existing poles in the
rights-of-way are full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional facilities or systems only
after the construction permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
paragraph shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new facilities or additional
facilities are attached.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights-of- way. In addition, all cable, wire or
fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface rights-of-way under this Chapter
may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire
or fiber optic cable may be installed under this Chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (h)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall promptly and at its own expense, permanently
remove and relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the City finds
it necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the
City requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable
construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall
restore the rights-of-way to the same or better condition it was in prior to
said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or
relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or
similar size. The Director of Public Service may request relocation and/or
removal in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's
facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City or
County;
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right-of-way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. Chapter 723.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order is served
upon provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the City, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City at provider's cost and expense,
by another person; however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the provider,
and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (i)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. Before the start date of any
rights-of-way excavation, each provider who has facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and make every
reasonable attempt to mark the approximate vertical placement of all its
facilities. All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (j)   Rights-of-way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with any applicable laws and the
standards established by the Director of Public Service, and must inspect the
area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for
twelve (12) months thereafter.
      (2)   In approving an application for a permit, the City may choose
either to have the permittee restore the rights-of-way or the City may restore
the rights-of-way itself.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights-of-
way, construction permittee shall at the time of application of a construction
permit post a construction bond in an amount determined by the City to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to its pre-
excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion of the
restoration of the rights-of-way, the City determines that the rights-of- way
have been properly restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be
released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the City. The City shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
City in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights-of-way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights-of-way;
the pre-excavation condition of the rights-of-way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights-of-way effected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights-of-way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights-of-way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration shall be according to the rules,
regulations, and standards established by the Director of Public Service or any
other laws.
      (5)   By restoring the rights-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Department of Public Service, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary using the method required by the Department of Public Service.
Weather permitting, the work shall be completed within five (5) calendar days
of the receipt of the notice from the Department of Public Service.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the City, the City, at its option, may
do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty
(30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other
costs incurred by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon any
bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal
and equitable remedies.
   (k)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or
the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and
pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the rights- of-way, which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the City's response to an
emergency caused by that provider's facilities.
   (l)   Rights-of-Way Vacation. If the City vacates a rights-of-way which
contains the facilities of a provider, such vacation shall be subject to the
provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 723. If the vacation requires the relocation of
the provider's facilities and if the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
provider, the provider will pay the relocation costs. If the vacation requires
the relocation of the provider's facilities and if the vacation proceedings are
initiated by the City for a public purpose, the provider or permittee must pay
the relocation costs unless otherwise agreed to by the City, the provider or
permittee.
   (m)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws and the standards as promulgated by the
Director of Public Service.
   (n)   Inspection.
      (1)   When the construction under any permit hereunder is completed, the
permittee shall notify the Department of Public Service.
      (2)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (3)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the inspector may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates
the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this Chapter.
      (4)   The inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided
in Section
907.23(d). An order may be appealed to the Director of Public Service. The
decision of the Director of Public service may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the provider shall present proof to the Director of Public
Service that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Director of Public Service may revoke
the Permit pursuant to Section
907.20(e).
   (o)   Other Obligations. Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve
permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and
authority and to pay all fees, including on site inspection fees, required by
the City, or any other city, county, state, or federal Laws.
      (1)   A permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, including
the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (2)   A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the
rights-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (3)   No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in Section
907.20(d)(1).
      (4)   A permittee shall not so obstruct a rights-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.
      (5)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (p)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the
service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.19   MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMITS.
   (a)   Minor Maintenance Permit Requirements.
      (1)   No person shall perform minor maintenance of facilities in the
rights-of-way without first having obtained a minor maintenance permit as set
forth in this Chapter. Minor maintenance means:
         A.   The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like
facilities not involving construction and not requiring traffic control for
more than thirty (30) minutes at any one location; or
         B.   The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like
facilities not involving construction and taking place on thoroughfares and
arteries between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.; or
         C.   The routine repair or replacement of facilities with like
facilities not involving construction on all rights-of-ways, other than
thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and is for a period
of less than eight (8) contiguous hours; or
         D.   Construction other than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes
less than eight (8) contiguous hours to complete, does not impede traffic and
does not involve a pavement cut.
      (2)   A minor maintenance permit allows the minor maintenance permittee
to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the rights-of-way as required.
      (3)   A minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of issuance until
December 31 of the year in which the minor maintenance permit was issued at
which time the minor maintenance permit shall expire.
      (4)   A minor maintenance permit must be displayed or upon request
produced within twelve (12) business hours.
      (5)   A minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no circumstances
provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without seeking additional
authority from the Director of the Department of Public Service.
   (b)   Minor Maintenance Permit Applications. Application for a minor
maintenance permit shall be made to the Director of the Department of Public
Service. In addition to any information required by the Director of Public
Service, all minor maintenance permit applications shall contain, and will only
be considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the applicant has obtained a Certificate of
Registration or proof that the applicant has written authority to apply for a
minor maintenance permit on behalf of a party that has been issued a
Certificate of Registration;
      (2)   Submission of a completed minor maintenance permit application in
the form required by the Director of Public Service.
      (3)   A statement that the applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, will prevent injury or damage to persons or property and to minimize
disruptions to the efficient movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (c)   Issuance of Minor Maintenance Permits; Conditions.
      (1)   If the Director of public service determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this Chapter and the minor maintenance permit
process, the Director of Public Service shall issue a minor maintenance permit
subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
      (2)   The City may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of the
minor maintenance permit and the performance of the minor maintenance permittee
thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure
the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and
safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)   Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The director of public service may
charge a fee for the issuance of the minor maintenance permit. No minor
maintenance permit shall be issued without payment of minor maintenance permit
fees except to the City or County, which shall be exempt. Minor maintenance
permit fees that were paid for a minor maintenance permit that the City has
revoked due to breach are not refundable. The Director of Public Service may
revoke the minor maintenance permit as any other permit may be revoked under
this Chapter.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.20   ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
construction permit or minor maintenance permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application; or
      (2)   To any person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
City; or
      (3)   To any person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for
the revocation of a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Director of Public Service, the
issuance of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Director of Public Service, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-
way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial. The Director of Public service may deny a permit in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
rights-of-way, or when necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users.
The Director of Public Service, in his or her discretion, may consider one or
more of the following factors: the extent to which rights-of-way space where
the permit is sought is available; the competing demands for the particular
space in the rights-of-way; the availability of other locations in the rights-
of-way or in other rights-of-way for the proposed facilities; the applicability
of this Chapter or other regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location
of facilities in the rights-of-way; the degree of compliance of the provider
with the terms and conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding
communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the
rights-of- way; the condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and
when it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the
costs of disruption to the public and damage to the rights- of-way, against the
benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the rights-of-way; and whether such applicant or their agent has
failed within the past three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full
compliance, with the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other
Chapters of the Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable law.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
907.20(a)(1) and
907.20(a)(2), the Director of Public Service may issue a permit in any case
where the permit is necessary:
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
         B.   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         C.   To allow a new economic development project.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this Section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project at the time it was required to submit its
list of next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit.
      (1)   Emergency Situations.
         A.   Each provider shall immediately notify the Director of Public
Service of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an
emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in
order to respond to the emergency. Within two (2) business days, unless
otherwise extended by the Director of Public Service, after the occurrence or
discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill all the
requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this Chapter for
any and all actions taken in response to the emergency.
         B.   In the event that the City becomes aware of an emergency
regarding a provider 's facilities, the City may attempt to contact the
provider or system representative of each provider affected, or potentially
affected, by the emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it
deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Non-Emergency Situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right-
of-way without a valid permit shall subsequently obtain a permit, pay double
the normal fee for the permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the rights-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this
Chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit; or
         D.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required construction or
removal bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section
907.18(o).
      (2)   If the Director of Public Service determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
provision or condition of the permit, the Director of Public Service shall
serve a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the
permit. Upon, a substantial breach, as stated above, the Director of Public
Service, may place additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Director of Public
Service with a plan, acceptable to the Director of Public Service, for its
correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Director of Public Service,
or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure
to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit.
      (4)   From time to time, the Director of Public Service may establish a
list of standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any
condition shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights-of-way
as defined in Section
907.14.
      (5)   If a permittee, commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed
further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
      (6)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.21   CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the County or City shall deposit with the
Director of Public Service an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/
or surety bond in an amount determined by the Director of Public Service to be
appropriate, based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction
default, problem, or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety
of the general public, the Director of Public Service shall serve the
construction permittee with notice detailing any construction default, problem,
or deficiency. If the Director of Public Service determines that correction or
repair of the construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or
has not been substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the
date following service of notification and detailing the construction default,
problem or deficiency, then the City may attach the letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the construction
permittee by the Director of Public Service.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration, and
continuously thereafter until one hundred twenty (120) days after a provider's
facilities have been removed from the rights- of-way, (unless the Director of
Public Service notifies the provider that a reasonably longer period shall
apply), a provider shall deposit with the Director of Public Service and
maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or a surety bond in an
amount equal to or greater than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The Director
of Public Service shall make all reasonable effort to allow provider a period
of five (5) business days after serving notification to correct or repair any
default, problem or deficiency prior to Director of Public Service' attachment
of letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon
attachment, written notice shall be provided to the provider by the Director of
Public Service.
   (c)   Blanket Bond. In lieu of the construction bond required by Section
907.21(a) and the removal bond required by Section
907.21(b), provider may deposit with the Director of Public Service an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of
five million dollars ($5,000,000). Unless a construction default, problem or
deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public,
the Director of Public Service shall make all reasonable effort to allow
permittee a period of five (5) business days after sending notification in
writing to the last known business address to correct or repair any
construction default, problem or deficiency prior to Director of Public Service
attachment of letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice
shall be provided to the provider by the Director of Public Service.
   (d)   Self Bonding. In lieu of the construction bond required by Section
907.21(a), the removal bond required by Section
907.21(b), and the blanket bond required by Section
907.21(c), those providers maintaining a book value in excess of twenty million
dollars ($20,000,000) may submit a statement to the Director of Public Service
requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a provider shall
assure the City that such self-bonding shall provide the City with no less
protection and security than would have been afforded to the City by a third
party surety providing provider with the types and amounts bonds detailed in
the above named Sections. This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Director of Public Service.
   (e)   Purposes. The bonds required by this Section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this Chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee or provider's violation of this Chapter or its failure to comply
with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the City
issued pursuant to this Chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including permit
fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums for the liability insurance required
pursuant to this Chapter;
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights-of-way pursuant to this
Chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the permittee or
provider is liable that are not paid by it's insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this Chapter or other law.
   (f)   Form.  The bond documents required by this Section, and any
replacement bond documents shall, contain the following endorsement: "It is
hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed
by the surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the
surety until ninety (90) days after completion of construction of the
facilities and, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or
not renewed by the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to
City of surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond."
(Ord. C64-00. Passed 8-21-00.)
907.22   INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   City Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the acceptance of an
application or the grant of a permit, the City does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service
claims; or
      (2)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification. By applying for and being issued a Certificate of
Registration with the City, a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a
permittee is required and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and
subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of
any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance,
repair or operation of its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or
near a rights-of-way, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed, or prohibited by a permit. A provider or permittee further agrees that
it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other
proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the City's
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation,
maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity undertaken in or
near a rights-of-way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed or prohibited by a permit. This Section is not, as to third parties, a
waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the provider,
permittee, or to the City; and the provider or permittee, in defending any
action on behalf of the City, if allowable by law, shall be entitled to assert
in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own
behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not
limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the City or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith:
         A.   To persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents or employees
attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights-of-
way, to which permittee's or provider's negligence shall in any way contribute,
and regardless of whether the City's negligence or the negligence of any other
party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury
or damage.
         B.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider or permittee, but
excluding claims arising out of or related to City programming.

reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of
applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness requiring other
information or documentation, including information of the type described
herein and in accordance with state and federal law or documentation intended
to illustrate the need for the request or to justify the business decision for
the request, does not toll the time period.
      (3)   The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the city's notice of
incompleteness.
      (4)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the city shall notify

for preventing the discharge of unacceptable materials to the City sewerage or
drainage systems.
   (c)   Any person in charge of or responsible for the process, activity or
function that causes, generates or produces a prohibited waste shall notify the
Director immediately upon the accidental loss or discharge in the sewerage or
drainage system of prohibited materials, substances or waste to enable
countermeasures to be taken to minimize damage to the wastewater treatment
system and/or the receiving waters. Such notification will not relieve the
responsible person of liability for any consequential expense, loss or damage
to the wastewater treatment system or for any fines and/or penalties imposed on
the City which result from the violative discharge. However, failure to so
notify upon knowledge of such unlawful discharge shall subject the responsible
person to the criminal penalty set forth herein.
(Ord. C49-76. Passed 6-21-76.)
935.11   CHARGES FOR DAMAGES TO SYSTEM.
   When a discharge of wastes by any person causes an obstruction of or damage

treatment process, a charge shall be levied by the Director of Public Service
against such person for the cost of the work required to clear and/or repair
the part of the sewage or drainage system or reestablish the treatment process
affected by such discharge. The Director shall add such charge to the usual
service charges, surcharges and fees, or bill the responsible person. Such
charge, as determined by the Director, shall be equal to the City's cost of
labor and material to clear and/or repair the affected part of the sewerage or
drainage systems. Failure to pay the bill within thirty days of its receipt by
the person responsible for the discharge shall subject that person to the
criminal penalty set forth herein.
(Ord. C49-76. Passed 6-21-76.)

established in the Codified Ordinances, and work shall be completed in
accordance with the provisions of the Building Code and
Chapter 1103. The permit shall expire ninety days after its issuance. If within
such period of time no work has been performed, one-half of the building sewer
inspection fee paid by the applicant shall be returned upon request by the
applicant. The fee for the permit shall be credited to and deposited in the
District's Sewer Revenue Fund.
   (f)   The fee charges in subsections (b) and (e) hereof include the cost of

of failure of the owner, his contractor or authorized representative to
install, maintain, repair, alter or perform other work in accordance with
Chapter 1103 and the Building Code, an additional fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
per hour, or increment thereof, of inspection time required to insure
compliance with the requirements herein shall be charged. Such additional fees
shall be paid prior to the final approval of the building sewer for which the

   This chapter establishes stormwater management requirements within the City.
The City has a Stormwater Design Manual that gives more specific guidance on
the procedures and calculation methodologies required to meet the requirements
of this chapter. While adherence will not eliminate non-point source pollution,
stop flooding or prevent all damage caused by flooding, it does establish a
basis for design which will:
   (a)   Minimize the damage and inconvenience of flooding;
   (b)   Provide drainage systems which continue to provide benefit over the
long term;
   (c)   Minimize the expense of maintaining the drainage facilities within the
City;
   (d)   Reduce non-point-source pollution;
   (e)   Minimize new impacts on engineered and natural drainage systems; and
   (f)   Prevent or reduce impacts to stream and river ecosystems.
(Ord. C56-15. Passed 9-8-15.)
971.02 APPLICABILITY.
   The applicability of this chapter shall govern all developments and
redevelopments within the City; however it does not alleviate the requirement
for permits from state and federal agencies. The following exceptions from the
peak flow rate controls of Section
971.06 are as follows:
   (a)   Single-family residential lot not part of a larger common development
or sale;

five acres; development shall be designed to have capacity and depth, including
sufficient invert elevations to permit future connections, to serve that total
tributary area up to the 100-year storm frequency. The system for the upstream
tributary area shall be extended through the development.
   (i)   Developments with less than one acre of disturbance as long as the
following requiremnts have been complied with:
      (1)   Land uses and developments which increase runoff rate or volume
shall control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to off-site
land or the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4).
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the property owner to not change or
alter any drainage course, ditch, flood routing path or drainage system on the
property that will cause increased runoff, or will damage or cause flooding to
adjacent, upstream or downstream property owners.
      (3)   All stormwater drainage systems, including conveyances, within a
development shall be designed to have capacity and depth, including sufficient
invert elevations to permit future connections, to serve that total tributary
area up to the 100-year storm frequency. The system for the upstream tributary
are shall be extended through the development.
      (4)   All proposed developments with a runoff rate greater than that
which the downstream system has capacity for, or will be designed for, will be
required to control the rate of stormwater discharge.
      (5)   Any site improvement plan shall be submitted to the City for review
and approval prior to the commencement of work at any proposed development
site.
      (6)   All information necessary shall be submitted to the City to
determine how stormwater runoff should be controlled within the development
prior to its release to downstream properties. The tributary area and the
upstream watersheds should be determined using natural land divides unless man-
made alterations are approved by the City's Engineer as the basis for watershed
delineations.
   (j)   Properly permitted environmental restoration projects including
wetlands, stream restoration, and other related activities.
   (k)   Developments within previously approved stormwater master plans.

may be altered with the approval of the Planning Commission from the
Thoroughfare Plan's general location in order to improve the compatibility of
the thoroughfare with the proposed development.
         C.   On-street parking is prohibited for all streets that do not have
curbing or curb and gutter. Omission of curbing or curb and gutter requires
Planning Commission approval. On-street parking is prohibited on all streets

   (g)   The Director of Public Service shall be responsible for enforcement of
the Stormwater Design Requirements and shall not allow any development of land
unless such development meets the design requirements specified in
Chapter 971 and the City of Grove City's Stormwater Design Manual adopted by
City Council. The Stormwater Design Manual shall be available on the City's
website and hardcopies are on file with and available from the Director of
Public Service and Clerk of Council. All natural open watercourses shall be
protected by establishing a Stream Corridor Protection Zone as specified in the
City's Stormwater Design Manual. All stormwater controls shall be designed in
accordance with the design specifications provided in the City's Stormwater
Design Manual. Storm drainage systems for land being developed or improved
shall be designed so that the peak rate of stormwater runoff after development
does not exceed the peak rate of runoff before development for all storms, from
the critical storm up to a 100 year frequency-twenty-four hour storm, and does
not exceed the peak rate of runoff for a one year frequency storm before
development of the land for all storms, from a one year frequency-twenty-four
hour storm through the critical storm. (Ord. C55-15. Passed 9-8-15.)
      (1)   The critical storm shall be determined by:
         Determining the total volume of runoff from a one year frequency-
twenty-four hour storm occurring over the area before and after development.
         Determining the percent of increase in volume due to development and
using this percentage and picking the critical storm from the following table:
If the percentage of increase in               
volume of runoff is
equal to or greater than         and less than The critical storm for discharge
                                               limitation will be:
-                                10            1 year
10                               20            2 years
20                               50            5 years
50                               100           10 years
100                              250           25 years
250                              500           50 years
500                              -             100 years
 
      (2)   Storage volume does not have to be provided for off-site upstream
runoff. Flow from such areas will be routed through the development's drainage
system at a rate determined in the same manner as the on-site system. Off-site
land uses and the associated drainage systems prevailing at the time of
development shall be considered as the pre-development condition for the
purpose of calculating the flows to be routed through the development.
      (3)   The development's interior drainage system shall be designed per
the design storm standards as outlined within the City’s Stormwater Design
Manual, except that the year frequency twenty-four hour storm that is
compatible with the existing drainage system shall be used when connecting
directly to the existing system with the conduit flowing full with surcharge to
the gutter line and the:
         Depth of flow in natural channels being no more than bank full stage,
backwater effects considered.
         Depth of flow in artificial channels being no more than 0.8 bank full
stage and the velocity being less than seven feet per second, unless special
channel lining and erosion protection is provided.
         Flow in roadside ditches being within the right-of-way and the
velocity of the design being less than six feet per second with grass swales or
ten feet per second with paved ditches.
         Depth of flow in streets with curb and gutter being less than the curb
height and the velocity of flow in the gutter at design depth being less than
ten feet per second.
         Street drainage shall be designed per the pavement spread standards as
outlined within the City’s Stormwater Design Manual. (Ord. C55-15. Passed 9-8-
15.)
      (4)   The development's interior drainage system shall be designed so
that it can carry the runoff from a 100 year frequency twenty-four hour storm
with the conduits carrying not more than one-half their design capacity; the
water running not more than eighteen inches deep at the gutter line on local
streets, six inches deep at the crown on thoroughfares and six inches deep in
parking stall areas of parking lots; the overland and channel flows being
within easements and at least five feet horizontally and one foot vertically
away from any ground level entrance to a residential, office, commercial or
industrial building; and without endangering property or public safety through
erosion or high velocities.
      (5)   For peak flow rate analysis, the 12-hour rainfall depths, shown on
Table 3-3 from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Atlas 14,
Sullivant Avenue Station 33-1781, shall be used. The Midwest Climate Center
Bulletin 71, Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the Midwest, shall be used as the
reference document for selection of a rainfall distribution. For quantitative

required for the Development Plan. After approval by Council, the owner may
elect to construct certain portions or all of the public improvements prior to
filing and recording of the plat. Such an election by the owner does not
relieve the owner of the requirement to provide public improvements in
accordance with
Chapters 1101 and
1103 of the Codified Ordinances. At such time as the owner desires to file and
record the plat with the County Recorder, the owner shall guarantee the
construction of the public improvements in accordance with Section

of tracings, such tracings become the property of and will remain in the
custody of the City, except that the developer will be required to correct the
plans to conform to the “as built” conditions. Public improvements will not be
accepted by the City until the “as built” tracings are delivered to the
Engineer together with two prints thereof.
   (i)   In order to be heard by the Planning Commission, a fee of $150 for a
Preliminary Development Plan, $300 for a Development Plan, or $50 for a Plat,
payable to the City for deposit in the General Fund, shall accompany the

(Ord. C60-73. Passed 8-6-73.)
   (b)   Public Sites/Open Space Requirements.
      (1)   Upon the submission of a proposed residential development there
shall be dedicated on said plan, areas dedicated to the city for public
purposes, or reserved for park, playground, recreational, educational or open
space. Said dedication shall be exclusive of public right-of-way and any
street, road, highway, sidewalk, entrance feature areas, landscape areas
without recreational amenities (i.e. buffer landscaping adjacent to right- of-
way) and areas within the 100-year floodplain. The dedicated land can include
passive recreational areas including bike paths, certain commercial
recreational areas, tree stands or dedicated green space and storm water
retention areas (not detention or dry basins) that meet the city’s pond design
criteria and are incorporated into the overall development plan for aesthetic
purposes. In the event that a storm-water retention area is proposed to be
dedicated to satisfy the provisions of this section the same shall not
constitute more than 15% of the area dedication required by this provision. In
addition, areas containing overhead utilities and/or easements may be used to
meet the land requirement only if approved by Planning Commission and City
Council.
      (2)   The foregoing is intended as examples of appropriate public site/
open space dedication and not as an exclusive list. Appropriate public site/
open space dedication shall be determined as set forth below:
         A.   The goal of the city is to provide 20 acres of appropriate open
space/public land or other recreational areas for every 1,000 residents.
         B.   The land dedication requirement of this section shall be computed
as follows for single-family developments:
            1.   Determine the number of proposed single-family dwelling units;
            2.   Multiply the number of proposed units times the “average
single-family household size” as established by the most current U.S. Census
Summary of Occupancy and Housing Characteristics for Grove City. The current
figure according to the 2000 census data is 2.73 occupants per household;
            3.   Divide the figure determined in subsection (B)(2) hereof by
1,000 (people); and
            4.   Multiply the figure determined in subsection (B)(3) hereof by
20 (acres/1,000 people). This figure represents the amount of acreage that must
be dedicated to satisfy the public sites/open space requirements of this
section for single-family developments.
         C.   The land dedication requirement of this section shall be computed
as follows for all other residential developments:
            1.   Determine the number of proposed dwelling units;
            2.   Multiply the number of proposed units times the “average
multi-family household size” as established by the most current U.S. Census
Summary of Occupancy and Housing Characteristics for Grove City. The current
figure according to the 2000 census data is 2.29 occupants per household;
            3.   Divide the figure determined in subsection (C)(2) hereof by
1,000 (people); and
            4.   Multiply the figure determined in subsection (C)(3) hereof by
20 (acres/1,000 people). This figure represents the amount of acreage that must
be dedicated to satisfy the public sites/open space requirement of this section
for other than single-family developments.
         D.   For developments that include both single-family and non-single-
family residential units, the respective calculations shall be made for the
entire site.
      (3)   The proposed dedicated land, together with the restriction imposed
on the same, must be deemed to be appropriate by the Planning Commission and
City Council before the development plan and/or plat is approved. The Planning
Commission and City Council shall determine the dedicated land to be
appropriate only if the proposed dedicated land can be used to accomplish the
goals of this section and the provisions of subsection (1) and (2) hereof. When
making a determination of whether the proposed dedicated land is appropriate,
the Planning Commission and City Council shall consider the comments received
through the administrative review process. Other information and comments that
the Planning Commission and City Council deems appropriate may be used in
determining the appropriateness of the land to be dedicated.
      (4)   To the extent that the required land dedication established by this
section is not sufficient either because no land is dedicated or the land that
is proposed for dedication is determined not to be appropriate due to size,
configuration, location or type, by the Planning Commission and City Council,
then a monitory payment shall be made. All payments made pursuant to this
subsection shall be deposited in the Recreation Development Fund.
      (5)   Calculation of the monitory payment in lieu of land shall be made
as follows and paid prior to the approval of the record plat:
         A.   Determine the total amount of acreage required pursuant to
subsections (2)B., (2)C. and (2)D. hereof;
         B.   Subtract the total amount of acreage approved as appropriate by
the Commission and City Council, pursuant to subsection (3) hereof;
         C.   Multiply the amount of acreage determined above by $30,000 which
represents the average cost of an acre of developed park land; and
      (6)   All public sites/open space shall be deemed final by dedication
through an approved plat or dedication ordinance by Council.
      (7)   Deviations from the foregoing requirements regarding either the
Land Contribution or the Park Fee may be granted for “good cause”. Nothing
herein shall be interpreted as requiring the grant of any deviations. “Good
cause” shall be limited to situations where the applicant is providing
significant infrastructure improvements that benefit areas outside the proposed
development area or contributing land directly to the school district for
school purposes.

construction cost as approved by the City Engineer for the public improvement;
or
      (3)   Subject to the approval of the Director of Finance, a certification
to the City by the institution, person or corporation financing the
construction of the public improvements stipulating that the funds in the
amount of the estimated construction cost are available and set aside from all
other funds;
      That these funds will not be released to the owner, developer, or their
agent, unless a release is signed by the City;
      That such release by the City only certifies that as best as the City can
determine, the construction was completed to the City's satisfaction and does
not relieve the owner and/or developer of the City's maintenance guarantee
requirement;
      That ten percent of all moneys released will be placed in an escrow
account for use by the City should there be cause for the City to have to
finish any work through the default, neglect or negligence of the owner,
developer, or their agents;
      That only the City shall have the right to release the funds in the
escrow account; and
      That acceptance of the public improvements by the City and the posting of
the one year maintenance guarantee shall constitute release of the funds in the
escrow account lacking any formal release by the City.

public improvement according to the approved construction drawing and the
agreement;
      (3)   Use the certified check, if any, or proceeds thereof, for the
purpose stated in subsection (k)(2); (Ord. C60-73. Passed 8-6-73.)
      (4)   Use the funds in the escrow account to continue any unfinished work
or replace any unaccepted work to a point that to the satisfaction of the
Director of Public Service all public improvements will not create a health or
safety hazard or create maintenance or repair expense to the city because of
their state of completion.
(Ord. C 42-75. Passed 6-23-75.)
      (5)   Proceed in the manner described and the penalties provided for in
Section
1103.99.
(Ord. C 60-73. Passed 8-6-73.)
1101.11   COSTS TO BE SHARED BY THE CITY.
   In consideration for the agreement by the developer and/or owner of the land
being developed to install utilities and/or streets to sizes and configurations
in excess of the needs of the land being developed, as defined herein, the City
shall share in the cost of the excess size and configuration of the utilities
and/or streets as stipulated herein.
   (a)   A utility or street shall be considered excessive to needs of the land
being developed when:
      (1)   The City specifically requires a size or configuration for the
purpose of meeting the future needs of the City as provided for in approved
systems studies or by ordinance.
      (2)   There is additional pavement width and depth and additional length
of storm sewers and other improvements required for all thoroughfares.
      (3)   The City requests that a waterline be twelve inches in diameter or
more when such size is not required to meet the needs of the land being
developed.
      (4)   A sanitary sewer line is twelve inches in diameter or more unless
this size is required for the land being developed by reason of grade or trench
loading requirements of the land being developed or because of anticipated flow
from the land being developed.
      (5)   Other conditions warrant cost sharing and such conditions are
approved by Council.
   (b)   The City shall share in the cost of improvements by:
      (1)   Paying for the material costs only for the size difference of the
waterline, sanitary sewer pipe and the appurtenances thereto between what is
required for the land being developed and what is excessive to the needs of the
land being developed.
      (2)   Paying for the materials F.O.B. the plant in the quantities
necessary to equal the cost of providing the excessive pavement width and depth
for all thoroughfares.
      (3)   Paying for the materials F.O.B. the plant, factory, supply depot or
warehouse for such other improvements that are excessive to the land being
developed as approved under subsection (a)(5) hereof.
      (4)   Paying a proportionate share of the engineering and design costs
for preparing the construction plans for an improvement excessive to the needs
of the land being developed when such excessive improvements eligible for cost
share require more than oversizing of waterlines, sanitary sewer lines and
appurtenances thereto or additional pavement width or depth.
   (c)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted, read or construed to
obligate the City for expenses incurred by the City, developer, owner,
contractor, subcontractor or other persons because of:
      (1)   Equipment or labor cost due to the oversizing or increased depth of
waterlines or sewers;
      (2)   Equipment, labor or material cost due to improperly and/or
unacceptable installed improvements including the removal and replacement
thereof; or
      (3)   Any improvements installed prior to the approval of the cost
sharing by the City.
   (d)   Upon approval by Council of the Development Plan for the land being
developed, the following procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The City Engineer shall identify all improvements eligible for cost
sharing;
      (2)   The Engineer shall estimate the cost of the City's portion of such
improvements;
      (3)   An ordinance shall be submitted to Council for approval,
appropriating funds to cover the City's portion;
      (4)   Upon completion and acceptance of the work and quantities thereof
by the Engineer, the costs shall be certified to the Administrative Assistant
by the Engineer.
   (e)   Failure of the developer or the owner of the land at the time of the
improvements construction to provide the Engineer with copies of billings,
invoices, contracts, agreements or such other evidence of costs as the Engineer
deems necessary within six months of completion and acceptance of the
improvements by the City shall constitute just cause to declare the City's
agreement to cost share as provided herein null and void and no reimbursement
shall be made or moneys paid without reapproval of Council.
(Ord. C60-74. Passed 9-16-74.)

1103.03   DEFINITIONS; ADDITIONAL SANITARY SEWER REQUIREMENTS; TESTS.
   (a)   As used in this chapter:
      (1)   “Sewage” means the liquid or water carried wastes from residences,
business buildings, institutions and industrial establishments together with
such ground water, surface water and storm water as may be present.
      (2)   “Domestic sewage” or “sanitary sewage” means sewage derived
principally from dwellings, business building, institutions and the like, which
originates within the building, including the wastes from kitchens, water
closets, lavatories, bathrooms, showers and laundries.
      (3)   “Industrial sewage” means the liquid wastes from industrial
processes as distinct from domestic sewage.
      (4)   “Sanitary sewers” means a pipe or conduit designed for the purpose
of carrying domestic sewage and industrial sewage from the point of origin to a
sewage treatment or disposal works or to a place of disposal, but which is not
intended to carry storm, surface, ground or subsurface waters.
      (5)   “Foundation drains” means subsurface drains laid around the
foundation of a building, either within or outside of the building foundation,
for the purpose of carrying ground or subsurface water to some point of
disposal.
      (6)   “Building sewer (house connection)” means that part of the sanitary
sewerage system which connects the plumbing of the house or building to a
common or public sewer. The building sewer begins three feet from and outside
the foundation wall.
      (7)   “Sewerage system” or “sewage works” means all of the facilities for
collecting, pumping, treating and disposing of sanitary sewage to and through
the sewage treatment or disposal works owned by the City or any additions or
extensions thereof.
   (b)   Y-branches shall be installed during the construction of the collector
sewers. If the sewer is located in a street, service extensions shall be made
to within one foot of the street right-of-way lines. Where the sewer is more
than twelve feet deep, risers shall be included as part of the construction
work. Such risers shall be brought to a point not less than ten feet below the
ground.
(Ord. C 61-73. Passed 8-6-73.)
   (c)   Concrete encasement shall be used when required for the sanitary sewer
to withstand the trench loadings, when hard shale or rock is encountered in the
trench bottom or when the cover over the sewer is less than two and one-half
feet.
(Ord. C29-77. Passed 4-18-77.)
   (d)   Leakage tests are required for all sanitary sewers except building
sewers unless a leakage test on a building sewer is requested by the Sewer
Inspector. Deflection tests are required for all sewers using PVC pipe.
      (1)   The sewer shall be tested in sections, each section extending
between two consecutive manholes or from the end of the sewer to the nearest
manhole. The contractor may elect to use either an infiltration test or an
exfiltration test as described herein.
      (2)   If the infiltration test is selected, each section of pipe shall be
covered with not less than two feet of ground water above the top of the pipe
at the highest point in the section being tested. The infiltration will be
measured by means of a V-notch weir located in the downstream manhole. All
service connections and stubs shall be capped or plugged to prevent the
entrance of ground water into the line at these connections.
      (3)   If the exfiltration test is selected, the inlet end of the upstream
and downstream manholes shall be closed with watertight bulkheads. Then the
sewer and the upsteam manhole shall be filled with water until the elevation of
water in the upsteam manhole is two feet higher than the top of the pipe in the
line being tested or two feet above the existing ground water in the trench,
whichever is the higher elevation. The exfiltration will be measured by
determining the amount of water required to maintain the initial water
elevation for one hour from the start of the test.
      (4)   The amount of infiltration or exfiltration as applicable, shall not
exceed a rate of 200 gallons per inch of pipe diameter per twenty-four hours
per mile of sewer in each and every section tested in accordance with this
subsection (d).
      (5)   The deflection test shall be made by pulling a rigid ball or
mandril with a diameter equal to ninety-five percent of the inside diameter of
the pipe through the sewer. This test shall be made after the backfilling of
the sewer line section being tested is completed.
   (e)   Building sewers shall be constructed at no expense to the City.
      (1)   Before any building sewer is constructed, a tap permit must be
obtained from the Building Inspector. Such permit will be issued in accordance
with the provisions of Chapters 935, 937 and 939. The person applying for a
permit shall identify the location of the tap. The person to whom a permit is
issued shall cause the building sewer to be installed in accordance with the
rules and regulations contained herein. All tap permits shall become null and
void ninety days from the date of issuance. No refund of the tap fee shall be
made unless a request is filed and the permit returned within the above
mentioned ninety days.
      (2)   All construction or repair of building sewers shall be inspected
and approved by the Sewer Inspector after the pipe has been laid and tap
completed, but before covering with the backfill.
   The person to whom the permit has been issued shall call the Building
Inspector requesting the inspection, at least one-half day before the
inspection is desired.
      (3)   The building sewer shall be constructed of a size not less than six
inches internal diameter, laid with a minimum fall of one-fourth inch per
linear foot, and shall be vitrified clay pipe, ABS Composite, PVC or ductile
iron pipe with watertight joists, as specified in Section
1103.02(c)(3), and using proper curves for all changes in alignment or grade.
Only adapters approved by the City Engineer shall be used to change from one
pipe material to another in any sewer line. The interior of each length of pipe
shall be made perfectly clean and free from offsets, fins, and projections
before the next length is connected thereto. The Sewer Inspector may, by
special permission in each case, authorize the building sewer to be constructed
with a fall as little as one-eighth inch per linear foot if he determines such
procedure to be desirable. The Sewer Inspector may require that the water
tightness of the joints be demonstrated by the testing procedures established
in subsection (d) hereof.
(Ord. C 94-73. Passed 12-17-73.)
      (4)   Old or existing building sewers may be used in connection with new
buildings or alterations to existing buildings only when it can be demonstrated
that such sewers conform in all respects to the requirements contained herein
for new building sewers. The Building Inspector may make an exception as to the
size of old building sewers provided they are not less than four inches in
internal diameter, and otherwise meet the requirements of this section.
      (5)   Building sewers shall not be constructed closer than three feet to
any exterior wall, cellar, basement or cistern nor shall they have less than
two feet of earth or stone cover.
      (6)   All excavation for building sewers shall be by open cut from the
surface. The sides of the trench shall be vertical, using such sheeting and
bracing as may be necessary to accomplish this result. The bottom of the
excavation shall be shaped to fit the lower half of the sewer pipe so that the
pipe will have uniform bearing from end to end. In order to accomplish uniform
bearing, adequate bell holes shall be excavated at each joint. In the event the
trench is excavated below the required grade of the pipe, the excess space
shall be filled with the stone specified for Type I bedding requirements of
Section 900 in Table A of Section
1103.02(b). The width of the trench at the top of the pipe shall not exceed two
feet plus the outside diameter of the pipe nor shall the width be less then one
foot plus the outside diameter of the pipe. When unstable, soft or spongy
conditions are encountered at the trench bottom, such material shall be removed
and replaced with clean, crushed stone sufficient to stabilize the trench
bottom to support the pipe to a true line and grade. Such work shall be
performed as directed by the Inspector. Water and gas services shall not be
laid in the same trench as the building sewer.
      (7)   No tap permit shall be issued for a building sewer, the
construction of which will require the opening, cutting, barricading or
otherwise impeding the normal flow of traffic of any public street, road or
alley until there is presented to the City, evidence, in writing, satisfactory
to the City, that permission for such opening, cutting, barricading or impeding
of traffic has been granted to the applicant from the governmental body having
authority to grant such permission. Any tap permit so issued shall be subject
to any restrictions or conditions contained in such written expression of
permission from the governmental body.
      (8)   The building sewer shall be backfilled to an elevation at least
twelve inches over the top of the pipe by tamping in finely graded soil or
granular material in six inch layers. Soil containing stones larger than two
inches in the greatest dimension shall not be used for this portion of the
backfill. The balance of the backfill shall be made in accordance with the
requirements of Table A, Section 900 of Section
1103.02(b).
      (9)   Connections to existing Y-branches shall be made carefully to avoid
damage to the bell of the branch or to the lateral sewer. Such damage as may
occur shall be repaired as directed by the Inspector. Connections to a lateral
or public sewer at a point where no Y-branch has been provided, shall be made
using a tapping saddle.
      (10)   The permit holder shall repair or restore any drains or service
lines damaged or disturbed by him during the construction of the building
sewer.
      (11)   No person, firm or corporation shall discharge or permit the
discharge of any deleterious wastes into the sewerage system. Such wastes are
defined as oils, acids, cyanides, poisons and any other substance, gas or
liquid which may in any way damage or interfere with the use or operation of
the sanitary sewers or sewage treatment plant or which may create a hazard to
life or property.
      (12)   No downspouts, surface inlets, foundation drains, subsurface
drains or any other source of ground or surface water shall be connected either
directly or indirectly to or discharged into any part of the sanitary sewerage
system. Such drains, inlets and downspouts shall be so constructed as to drain
or be pumped into the street, gutter, ditch or the storm sewers.
      (13)   Surface water which collects in basement or foundation excavations
shall not be discharged at any time into the building sewer. If the building
sewer is completed before the plumbing is connected thereto, the building sewer
shall be tightly closed at all times with a plumber's plug or other watertight
plug in order to prevent surface or ground water from entering the building
sewer.
(Ord. C 61-73. Passed 8-6-73.)
1103.04   ADDITIONAL WATER SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Taps may be made, by the developer, into the water mains he has
constructed or is in the process of constructing. If the developer does not
elect to make his own taps, then he must arrange with the City of Columbus to
do the work.
   (b)   Curb boxes shall be located between the sidewalk and the curb or as
near thereto as practicable. All curb boxes shall be adjusted to the finished
ground surface. They shall be of the Buffalo type. When the street is to be
curbed, a “W” shall be stamped into the face of the curb opposite each curb box
before the concrete has set.
   (c)   All water services shall be constructed of materials required by the
City of Columbus. No service line shall be less than three-fourth inch internal
diameter. If necessary to provide adequate supply and pressures, larger size
lines may be required by the Building Inspector.
(Ord. C61-73. Passed 8-6-73.)
   (d)   All water service lines shall be laid at least forty-two inches below
ground or pavement surface. No water service line shall be laid in the same
trench with electrical, sewer or sewer service line. All water services to be
constructed in or across paved streets shall be done by boring or jacking the
line under the surface. The cutting of existing paved surfaces for this purpose
will not be permitted except by special permission of the Director of Public
Service in each case.
(Ord. C50-89. Passed 7-17-89.)

1135.15   A-2 TOWNHOUSE AND ZERO LOT LINE DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this district is to provide areas for the
development of moderate to high density residential uses and structures in
moderately spacious surroundings.
   It is the intent of this section that these districts be located in the
suburban and intermediate portion of the City where a protected environment
suitable for moderate density residential use can be provided, as well as in
established moderate density residential areas as a means to ensure their
continuance. However, the use of this district is appropriate on a smaller
scale in the suburban portions of the City as a transitional or buffer zone
between low density residential districts or major transportation arteries, or
other uses that are not compatible with a low density residential environment.
   In fulfilling the purpose of this district, the townhouse concept may be
used which permits the construction of single family immediately adjacent to
one another without side yards between the individual units and which units
shall be structurally connected to at least one additional unit.
   (b)   Permitted Use. In an A-2 District, no building or land shall be used
or changed in use, and no building shall be hereafter located, erected or
structurally altered, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, except for the
following use:
      (1)   Townhouse dwelling. “Dwelling townhouse” means a residential unit
attached to one or more residential units by a common wall located on its own
lot and designed for or occupied by one family only.
      (2)   Conditional use. The use permitted under this section shall be
permitted as a conditional use in the A-1 Districts if it is approved by the
Planning Commission and subject to such conditions, restrictions and safeguards
as may be deemed necessary by the Commission. If approved by the Commission,
the standards of this district shall apply.
   (c)   Prohibited Uses. No business, profession or occupation shall be
permitted in an A-2 District.
   (d)   Building Height. In an A-2 District, no building shall exceed two and
one-half stories or thirty-five feet in height.
   (e)   Lot Area.
      (1)   In an A-2 Townhouse development, each unit lot shall have a minimum
of 2,000 square feet and width of not less than twenty feet.
      (2)   Where a townhouse structure is located on an end lot, the lot width
shall not be less than twenty-six feet.
      (3)   Where a townhouse structure is located on a corner lot, the lot
width shall not be less than fifty feet.
      (4)   All townhouse lots shall have a minimum of twenty feet frontage at
the building line.
      (5)   There shall not be erected more than twelve units per acre.
   (f)   Yards. In an A-2 District, garages shall be permitted in the front of
the unit on minor streets only. There shall be a twenty-six foot setback from
the right-of-way line.
   There shall be a thirty foot building setback from right-of-way line of
collector streets.
   On minor streets where head-in parking is provided, the building setback
shall be forty-six feet from right-of-way.
   There shall be no side yard for a townhouse structure except if the
structure is an end unit, the side yard shall not be less than six feet.
   Each lot shall have a minimum of twenty feet rear yard. The rear yard shall
not be used for parking and storage purposes.
   (g)   Rear Yard Parking. In an A-2 District where an applicant desires to
locate parking in the rear yard of the structure, the following conditions
shall apply:
      (1)   A minimum area between parking and townhouse of twenty feet to be
used as a yard unless parking is covered and attached whereby no rear yard is
required.
      (2)   A public access street or private drive is needed to provide flow
to and from parking areas as follows:
         A.   Public. Twenty feet right-of-way with sixteen feet of pavement.
“V” Section of pavement shall be permitted. The access street need not be
curbed.
         B.   Private Access Street. To have a pavement width suitable to carry
the flow of traffic. Subject to review of the Planning Commission.
   (h)   Lot Coverage. The total shall not exceed sixty percent (60%) coverage
by all structures of total lot area.
      (1)   A maximum of six living units shall be allowed in each row of
townhouses. When an end unit does not side on a street, an open space of at
least twenty feet in width shall be provided between it and an end unit of the
adjacent row of townhouses.
      (2)   Townhouses shall be constructed on side lot lines without side yard
and no windows, doors or other opening shall face a side lot line except that
outside wall of end units may contain such openings.
      (3)   Every two units shall change setback a minimum of four feet. The
purpose of this is to eliminate the box appearance that could develop with a
straight-line building.
   (i)   Streets.
      (1)   A collector street connecting with an existing collector or
arterial street shall have a fifty foot right-of-way with thirty-two feet of
pavement. On a collector street, parking shall be permitted in the rear only. A
thirty foot setback shall be required with no head-in parking permitted.
      (2)   A minor street shall have thirty feet of right of way with twenty-
six foot of pavement. Ten foot easements for public walks and utilities shall
be required on each side of a minor street.
      (3)   All minor streets ending in a cul-de-sac shall not exceed a maximum
length of 300 feet. Cul-de-sacs shall be constructed as per
Chapter 1103 of the Codified Ordinances with a forty-two foot right-of-way and
forty foot of pavement.
      (4)   All streets and curbs shall meet the construction requirements of
Part Eleven of the Codified Ordinances.
      (5)   No minor street shall end as a dead-end street.
   (j)   Parking. In an A-2 District, the applicant shall have the option of
locating the parking in the front or rear of each row of townhouses. The
location of the parking shall not vary within a row of townhouses.
   In an A-2 District, the parking requirements are as follows:
      (1)   The minimum space size shall be ten feet by twenty feet.
      (2)   There shall be a minimum of two spaces per unit and a maximum of
one-half space per unit for visitor parking.
      (3)   All parking on public streets shall be curbed.
      (4)   There shall be no head-in parking on a collector street.
      (5)   All parking spaces shall have a surface of concrete or asphalt.
      (6)   All parking spaces shall be clearly addressed or marked for unit
intended. Visitor parking spaces shall be clearly marked.
   (k)   Sidewalks. In an A-2 District, the parking requirements are as
follows: Sidewalks shall be installed as per
Chapter 1103 of the Codified Ordinances on collector streets. On minor streets,
sidewalks shall commence three feet from rear of curb and shall have a minimum
width of four feet on a minor street with head-in parking. No sidewalk shall
cross more than three parking spaces. Parking areas with more than three
parking spaces shall have sidewalk constructed around the parking area. Where

(Ord. C50-81. Passed 9-8-81.)
1135.16   RURAL DISTRICT.
   This zoning district is intended to allow the establishment of agricultural
operation of property and structures within the corporation limits and future
annexed property until such time as the land is rezoned for another use.
   The use of land and structures with the Rural District shall conform to the
following requirements:

1136.01   FINDINGS.
   Council hereby finds that changes in land use and zoning classification
resulting from the sprawl of urbanization have often necessitated the removal
of trees and other valuable natural resources and often have the effect of
degrading the appearance, character and value of existing land use patterns
within and surrounding the City.
(Ord. C11-96. Passed 2-20-96.)
1136.02   PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to protect and promote the public health,
safety and general welfare by fully utilizing the benefits of landscaping in
new development to ensure that the local stock of native trees is replenished;
to contribute to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, ground
water recharge and storm water run-off retardation, while at the same time
aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement; to buffer uncomplimentary and often
incompatible land uses by providing a transitional interface; to assist in
controlling traffic to and from, as well as within, off-street parking
facilities by limiting the internal movement of vehicles and pedestrians to
designated traffic configurations; to relieve the blighted appearance of
parking lots; to lessen the impact of structures, and to otherwise facilitate
the creation of a pleasant environment.
(Ord. C6-86. Passed 3-3-86; C58-97. Passed 11-17-97.)

1136.06   STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES.
   Public and private off-street parking facilities and other vehicular use
areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the following requirements.
   (a)   Frontage Along Public Streets.
      (1)   For parking lots up to 7,000 square feet and/or including less than
twenty-five cars. The setback for off-street car parking facilities is
determined by three development options as shown on Exhibit A-1 (Frontage
Landscaping Requirements for Off-Street Surface Parking Lots). Option A
requires a 10'-0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous
3'- 0" height evergreen hedge. Option B requires a 10'- 0" minimum parking and/
or drive aisle set-back with a continuous 3'- 0" minimum - 5'- 0" maximum
height wall constructed of like materials used on building. Option B may
consist of a combination of walls and 3'- 0" height evergreen hedges. Option C
requires a 20'- 0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a
continuous 3'- 0" height minimum earthen mound. In addition to these
requirements of the Zoning Code, one 2" minimum caliper large or medium class
tree is to be planted for each 35 feet of frontage.
      (2)   For parking lots exceeding 7,000 square feet or 25 cars. The
setback for off-street car parking facilities is determined by three
development options as shown on Exhibit A-2 (Frontage Landscaping Requirements
for Off-Street Surface Parking Lots). Option A requires a 15'- 0" minimum
parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous 3'- 0" height evergreen
hedge. Option B requires a 15'- 0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back
with a continuous 3'- 0" minimum to 5'- 0" maximum height wall constructed of
like materials used on building. Option B may consist of a combination of walls
and 3'- 0" height evergreen hedges. Option C requires a 25'- 0" minimum parking
and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous 3'- 0" height minimum earthen
mound. In addition to these requirements of the Zoning Code, one 2" minimum
caliper large or medium class tree is to be planted for each 35 feet of
frontage. The developer is encouraged to consider including additional planting
beds containing annual and/or perennial flowers to increase the aesthetic
appeal of the frontage landscape requirements.
(Ord. C17-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
      (3)   For Truck Vehicular Use Areas and Parking. The setback for off-
street truck parking facilities is as shown on Exhibit A-3 (Frontage
Requirement for Off-Street Surface Parking Lots). Truck parking, loading areas
and drive aisles require a 45'- 0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back
with a continuous 6'- 0" height minimum earthen mound. In conjunction with this
requirement three staggered rows of 6'- 0" height minimum evergreen trees at
20'- 0" maximum spacing and one 2"caliper minimum small class tree per each 40
lineal feet of frontage are to be planted.
(Ord. C17-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
   (b)   Rear and Side Yards Adjacent Compatible Use Districts. The setback
shall be 10'-0" minimum for car parking and/or drive aisles and 20'-0" minimum
for truck parking and/or drive aisles, as shown in Exhibit B-1. In addition to
these requirements of the Zoning Code, one 2" minimum caliper large or medium
class tree and two 18" height deciduous shrubs are to be planted for each 40
lineal feet of property line for all vehicular use areas. If evergreen trees
are preferred in lieu of large or medium class trees, the evergreen trees are
to be 6'- 0" minimum height and one tree is to be planted for each 20 lineal
feet of property line and two 18" height deciduous shrubs are to be planted for
each 40 lineal feet of property line for all vehicular use areas. Truck
vehicular use areas are to have a 6'- 0" height minimum evergreen tree planted
for every 20 lineal feet of property line and two 18" height deciduous shrubs
are to be planted for each 40 lineal feet of property line for all vehicular
use areas.
   (c)   Rear and Side Yards Adjacent Incompatible Use Districts. The setback
for off-street car and truck parking facilities is determined by two
development options for cars and a specific requirement for trucks as shown in
Exhibit B-2 (Side and Rear Yard Landscaping Requirement for Off-Street Parking
Lots). Option A for cars requires a 20'- 0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle
set-back with either a continuous 6'- 0" height wall or solid fence or a 90%
opaque 5'-0" height evergreen screen, or a combination thereof. Determination
as to which option would be required shall be made by the Urban Forester based
on proposed development of parking area in relation to location (i.e. corner
lots), street visibility, etc. In addition to the wall or fence, one 2" minimum
caliper small class tree, two 6'-0" height evergreen trees, and two 18" height
deciduous shrubs are to be planted per each 40 lineal feet of property line. In
addition to the evergreen screen, four 18" height deciduous shrubs are to be
planted per each 40 lineal feet of property line. The developer is encouraged
to consider including additional planting beds containing annual and/or
perennial flowers to increase the aesthetic appeal of the parking side of the
screen. Option B for cars requires a 30'- 0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle
setback with a continuous 4'- 0" height minimum earthen mound. In addition to
the mounding requirement a double staggered row of 6'- 0" height minimum
evergreen trees at 20'- 0" maximum spacing and one 2" caliper minimum small
class tree and two 18" height deciduous shrubs per each 40 lineal feet of
property line are to be planted. Truck vehicular areas require a 45'- 0"
minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous 6'-0" height
minimum earthen mound. In addition to the mounding requirement three staggered
rows of 6'- 0" height minimum evergreen trees at 20'- 0" maximum spacing and
one 2" caliper minimum small class tree and two 18" height deciduous shrubs per
each 40 lineal feet of property line are to be planted.

aisle end island, or planting area is to contain at least one, 2" minimum
caliper large or medium class tree. Islands, peninsulas, aisle end islands, and
planting areas are to be located as follows: between twenty-five (25) and
forty-two (42) spaces, one (1) island required; between forty-three (43) and
sixty (60), two (2) islands required; beginning with sixty-one (61), one island
shall be added for each additional fifteen (15) spaces. Where islands are
required, there shall be a maximum of 21 consecutive spaces. Parking aisles
shall be defined as a row of parking spaces beginning and ending with either a
peninsula, isle end island, planting area, or a drive aisle. All parking
aisles, of seven (7) spaces or less, may be terminated with a drive isle,
unless its end is adjacent to a curb cut. Peninsulas, islands, and aisle end
islands are to be minimum sizes of eight feet (8') in width and thirty-six feet
(36') in length, or eight feet (8') in width and eighteen feet (18') in length,

pumps, utility vaults which extend above grade, and other equipment or elements
providing service to a building or site, are to be screened in all zoning
districts. A continuous 100% opaque landscape hedge, solid fence, wall, or
earthen mound is required to enclose any service structure on all exposed
sides. If such structure is frequently moved (i.e.: trash dumpster) a gate or
gates shall be permitted on one side. Said gate(s) shall be kept closed to
provide full 4-sided screening. Screening shall be one foot (1'- 0") higher
than service structure but shall not be required to exceed 8'- 0" in height
(6'- 0" height for walls and fences.). If walls or fences are used,
supplemental landscaping will be required. Provide 36" height minimum plantings
at 5'- 0" maximum spacing around the enclosed portion of the perimeter screen.
Curbing and/or bollards are to be installed around any trash disposal or waste

1137.01   NONCONFORMING USES DECLARED; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Subject to the provisions of this section, a use of land or building,
existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter, may be continued even

the district in which it is located.
   (a)   No enlargement or expansion shall be permitted except as approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   Except by variance granted by the Board, no building arranged,
designed and devoted to a nonconforming use and conducted without abandonment
as stated in Section
1137.02 may be reconstructed, structurally altered or enlarged in any lawful
manner, or extended so as to increase floor space over that existing, unless
the use of the building is changed to conforming use.
   (c)   If any nonconforming structure or use is, by any cause, damaged to the
extent of fifty percent (50%) of its value as determined by the Building
Inspector, it shall not thereafter be reconstructed as such.
(Ord. C79-74. Passed 1-20-75; Ord. C37-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the use of presently subdivided,
nonconforming lots for purposes approved in
Chapter 1135.
(Ord. C48-78. Passed 8-21-78.)
   (e)   The Board may provide, upon appeal from a refusal of issuance of a

extension or substitution of any nonconforming use.
(Ord. C79-74. Passed 1-20-75.)
1137.02   ABANDONMENT OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   A nonconforming use of a building or land which has been abandoned shall not
thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. The enactment of this section
shall not in any way affect the force and legality of previous orders requiring
the discontinuance of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use shall be
considered abandoned, as follows:
   (a)   When the intent of the owner to discontinue use is apparent.
(Ord. C79-74. Passed 1-20-75.)

use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar
equipment within ninety days, unless other facts show intention to resume the
nonconforming use.
   (d)   When such nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.

such frontage is improved with residences, all future buildings shall maintain
a frontage aligned with the existing buildings. Such alignment shall be regular

existing alignments vary to a greater extent, the Planning Commission shall
establish rules for defining and regulating building lines as may in its

restricted area that it cannot be appropriately improved without building
beyond the front yard line established by the above sections, the Planning
Commission shall, on application in a specific case, authorize the construction
of a building beyond such front yard line to an extent necessary to secure an
appropriate improvement of such parcel of land.

HISTORICAL PRESERVATION AREA
1138.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Historical Preservation Area is to maintain and enhance
the distinctive character of the older sections of the City by safeguarding the
architectural integrity of the various period structures within it, and to
prevent intrusions and alterations within the district that would be
incompatible with this established character. Decisions regarding the
appropriateness of alterations, demolitions and new construction within the
Historical Preservation Area shall be generally guided by the Secretary of
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating
Historic Buildings.
(Ord. C70-86. Passed 10-20-86; Ord. C39-19. Passed 8-19-19.)
1138.02   BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the Historical Preservation Area are the properties facing
on Broadway from Southwest Boulevard south to approximately 341 feet south of
Woodlawn Avenue, from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tracks east to Haughn
Road on Park Street and from Broadway east to Haughn Road on Columbus Street.
(Ord. C70-86. Passed 10-20-86.)
1138.03   CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATE OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change to the exterior
surface of structures or to the other environmental features of the district,
including landscaping, vegetation and exterior signage, the Planning Commission
and/or Chief Building and Zoning Official shall consider the following:
   (a)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period
building, structure or site and their environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided when possible.
   (b)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (c)   Whereas changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment, if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance, if any, shall be recognized and respected.
   (d)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (e)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of architectural features should be based on accurate duplications
of features, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (f)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with methods
designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials should
be avoided.
   (g)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any project.
   (h)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (i)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired.
(Ord. C70-86. Passed 10-20-86; Ord. C49-10. Passed 8-16-10.)
1138.04   DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Existing Structures and Premises. Reconstruction or rehabilitation
within the Historical Preservation Area shall conform to the distinguishing,
original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its site and its
environment.
   (b)   New Construction. The design of new structures and of additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and
color of other structures and premises with the Historical Preservation Area.
   (c)   Materials.
      (1)   All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of existing
structures within the Historical Preservation Area shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and wood.
      (2)   The use of contemporary materials, such as aluminum, other metals,
fiberglass and plastics for exterior surfaces on architecturally significant
structures shall be prohibited unless the use of such materials would
contribute to preservation or enhancement of existing traditional materials and
the overall integrity and longevity of a structure.
   (d)   Color. Approved colors shall be limited to black, white and those
colors included in the following categories on the Pratt and Lambert 133-7880-
597 brochure: Colonial and Federal Styles, Early Victorian Period and/or Late
Victorian Period. Identical colors from other manufacturers are also permitted.
Only these approved colors shall be used for building exteriors for all new
construction, reconstruction, remodeling and exterior maintenance of existing
structures within the historical area unless otherwise approved by Council. One
(1) copy of the Pratt and Lambert 133-7880-597 brochure is on file in the
office of the Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall retain and make

material standards of this section, be of such a style or design that reflects
the era during which the structure was built, and shall conform to the
requirements of
Chapter 1138 and Section
1145.14 of the Codified Ordinances. Sign size and shape shall also respond to
the existing proportions of period structures, and signs shall not be permitted
to cover, “blank-out” or close existing window and doorway openings or

maintenance or repair of any property within the historical area, provided such
work is limited to existing structures, and does not involve new construction
and/or additions to structures. The Chief Building and Zoning Official shall
determine whether the proposed changes are “significant” based upon the impact
the changes will have on the property and its surrounding area and the
standards set forth in this chapter. If the Chief Building and Zoning Official
determines that the proposed changes are not “significant,” he may issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness. Nor shall anything in this chapter be construed
to prevent any change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration
or demolition of any feature which in the view of the Building Inspector is
required for the public safety because of an unsafe, insecure or dangerous
condition.

1143.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to maintain a high character of community
development to protect the stability of property values and for the general
community welfare by regulating the exterior characteristics of non-residential
structures and preservation of buildings. The following purposes are hereby
established to protect and promote harmony of developments in the City:
   (a)   To define the concepts and components of planning and design, which
would cause all commercial renovation and new construction to be compatible
with the places and properties of the commercial districts, which constitute
the City's development heritage, thereby protecting the value of property.
   (b)   To create, protect and preserve civic qualities, open spaces,
effective traffic flow and vehicular access within community entry corridors,
all of which help define the high quality of community heritage necessary for
the City to retain its economic identity.
   (c)   To establish design and development concepts and guidelines to promote
architectural continuity and good design, and to promote and create desirable
relationships between circulation systems and adjacent land uses, and the
related relationships between parking areas and buildings within the existing
community.
(Ord. C33-01. Passed 5-21-01.)
1143.02   AREAS REGULATED.
   This chapter governs all zoning classifications except 1, 2 and 3 family
Residential and the Historical Preservation Area.
(Ord. C33-01. Passed 5-21-01.)
1143.03   CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change to the exterior
surface of structures in the areas regulated, the Chief Building and Zoning
Official, or Planning Commission and Council in the case of appeal, as
established in
1143.05(b), shall consider the following:
   (a)   The distinguishing qualities or character of the area in which the
proposed change is located shall not be diminished. Changes should be
harmonious with or a betterment of the qualities and character of the
surrounding properties. Changes, which result in the removal or alteration of
any material or distinctive architectural features, shall be discouraged.
   (b)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site should be treated with
sensitivity.
   (c)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources on or adjacent to the property.
   (d)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with
size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or
environment.
   (e)   Compliance with any other Regulated District established in the
Codified Ordinances for the City.
(Ord. C33-01. Passed 5-21-01.)
1143.04   DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   The Design Guidelines are intended to create a building and site design that
is compatible with the other buildings in the areas regulated and with the
building's neighbors. The following materials are considered to be examples
(but not a complete listing) of materials harmonious to the areas regulated:
   (a)   Brick. Brick should be in colors or color ranges which are harmonious
with other materials of the building and the area in which the property is
located. Colors in the red family are encouraged. Glazed brick is discouraged
unless it is used only as a minor feature. Brick should be laid up in common
bond; stack bond is strongly discouraged. Applying any application to a brick
surface shall be discouraged.
   (b)   Stone. Rubble or random Ashlars limestone are encouraged.
   (c)   Wood Siding. Wood siding in a natural, color stained or painted state.
Stain and paint colors shall be compatible with other buildings in the area in
which the property is located.
   (d)   Vinyl Siding. Horizontal vinyl siding may be used in limited amounts.
Large expanses of vinyl siding are discouraged. Eight, five or four-inch
exposure along with color shall be compatible with buildings in the area in
which the property is located.
   (e)   Alternative materials. Alternative materials may be approved based on
compatibility with buildings on or in the area in which the property is
located, and as approved by the Chief Building and Zoning Official, or in the
case of appeal, as established in
1143.05(b), by the Planning Commission and Council.
(Ord. C33-01. Passed 5-21-01.)
1143.05   PROCEDURES.
   (a)   A certificate of appropriateness is required from the City prior to
any exterior changes, site modification, remodeling, reconstruction or
demolition.
   (b)   Applications for certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with
the Building Department. The Chief Building and Zoning Official shall determine
whether the proposed changes are “significant” based upon the impact the
changes will have on the property and its surrounding area. If the Chief
Building and Zoning Official determines that the proposed changes are not
significant, he shall so inform the applicant and no Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be required. If the Chief Building and Zoning Official
determines that the proposed changes are significant, he shall review the
application for compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, and either
issue or deny the request for the Certificate of Appropriateness. All requests
for Certificates of Appropriateness submitted under this Chapter shall be
deemed approved unless the Chief Building and Zoning Official disapproves the
same within 15 days of submission of the application.
   (c)   Any person whose application for a Certificate of Appropriateness has
been denied by the Chief Building and Zoning Official may appeal such decision
by filing an appeal with the Planning Commission within 30 days of such denial,
and at least 14 days prior to the Planning Commission meeting date at which
such appeal shall be heard. The appeal shall be in the form of a “Request for
Application to the Planning Commission and Council”, which must be fully
completed and contain all materials required pursuant to Section
1143.06. The application, with 18 copies, along with a check for $50.00 (made
payable to the City of Grove City) must be submitted to the secretary of the
Planning Commission. The appeal shall be treated as an original application for
approval pursuant to
Chapter 1101, under which the Planning Commission shall examine, take action
within 45 days and forward its recommendations to Council for its approval,
approval with modifications, or denial. The decision of Council shall be final.
Upon approval or approval with modifications by Council, the Chief Building and
Zoning Official shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness to the applicant
within fifteen days.
(Ord. C33-01. Passed 5-21-01.)

appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any
change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of
any feature which in the view of the Chief Building and Zoning Official is

1329.01   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Grove City are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (b)   Uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.02   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this Code is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of the citizenry, and to minimize public and private losses due
to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health.
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazards.
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight
areas.
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area
of special flood hazard.
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. C39-87. Passed 5-18-87; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.03   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

   (n)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
   (o)   "Manufactured home park" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent. This definition
shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Ohio R.C. 3733.01, for
which the Public Health Council has exclusive rule making power.
   (p)   "Manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale. This
definition shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Ohio R.C.
3733.01, for which the Public Health Council has exclusive rule making power.
   (q)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (r)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection;

duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   (s)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filing; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,

condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood
related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-
year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event,
on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (v)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designated as a
"historic structure"; or
      (3)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.
   (w)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (x)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with this ordinance.
(Ord. C3-94. Passed 1-18-94; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.05   APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City of Grove City as identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas annexed by the
City of Grove City.
(Ord. C47-95. Passed 8-7-95; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
"Flood Insurance Study for Franklin County, Ohio, and Incorporated Areas". This
Study, dated March 16, 2004, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and
any revisions thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of this Code. The Flood Insurance Study is on file in the City Hall, 4035
Broadway, Grove City, Ohio.
   (b)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio, which has been approved
by the City of Grove City as required by 1329.21 Subdivisions and Large
Development.

   The degree of flood protection required by this Code is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Code does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Code shall
not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee thereof,
or the Federal Emergency Agency, for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this Code or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. C39-87. Passed 5-18-87; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.11   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by the courts
to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of the ordinance as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so
declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)

      (4)   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this ordinance.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data. In areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in accordance with Section
1329.06, the Building Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation data available from a Federal, State or other source
including data obtained under Section
1329.21 in order to administer Section
1329.20(a) and (b).
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (c)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:

notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1329.12(d) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion
of such watercourse will not be diminished.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered
or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
(Ord. C3-94. Passed 1-18-94.)
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
from the Flood Insurance Study shall prevail. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1329.16.
(Ord. C47-95. Passed 8-7-95; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)

Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (c)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Franklin Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (d)   In passing such application, the Board shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;

1329.17   CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (a)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level providing the items in Section
1329.16(d) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the
one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
(Ord. C39-87. Passed 5-18-87; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (b)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
(Ord. C3-94. Passed 1-18-94.)
   (c)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (d)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (e)   Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics of
the property compliance with the requirements of this ordinance creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this ordinance do not constitute an exceptional hardship.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (f)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance shall not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
Section
1329.16(d), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (g)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure shall be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
shall be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. C39-87. Passed 5-18-87; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)

(Ord. C47-95. Passed 8-7-95; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.22   FLOODWAYS.
   The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1329.06 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1329.15(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and cause erosion. The
following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
(Ord. C39-87. Passed 5-18-87; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (b)   If Section
1329.22(a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Section
1329.20.
(Ord. C47-95. Passed 8-7-95; Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
   (c)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests shall be submitted by the
City Administration to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and shall meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. C3-94. Passed 1-18-94.)
1329.23   AREAS WITHOUT FLOODWAYS
   In all areas of special flood hazard where the Flood Insurance Study
provides base flood elevation data as set forth in Section
1329.06, but no floodways have been designated, the following provisions apply:
   (a)   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one-half foot at any point.
   (b)   If Section
1329.23 (a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this
code.
(Ord. C17-04. Passed 3-1-04.)
1329.99   PENALTY.

with the business concern and the business concern so notifies the Division in
writing. During this ninety (90) day period, the work on existing permits may
be followed through to completion, but no new work shall be commenced.
   (d)   In such event, a new Building Division issued registration, setting
forth the name of the new registered individual, shall be issued to the
registered business. No additional fee shall be required for the issuance of
this new registration within the same registration year.
   (e)   No Building Division issued registration-holder shall be named in any
Building Division issued registration to a business concern, who within ninety
(90) calendar days immediately preceding to the filing of an application for a
Building Division issued registration shall have been the registration-holder
designated as the registration-holder in the licensure of any business concern,
unless it had been in the Building Division issued registration of the
registrant him or herself.
   (f)   Exception. Upon presentation of satisfactory evidence of whichever of
the following conditions having occurred that caused the termination of the
currently registered-business, the ninety (90) day period may be waived by the
Chief Building and Zoning Official:
      (1)   Closure of the registered-business because of Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
      (2)   Dissolution of the registered-business that is a corporation,
limited liability partnership (LLP), or a limited liability corporation (LLC)
that was filed and recorded and in good standing with the Secretary of the
State of Ohio.
      (3)   Merger or consolidation of the registered-business with a
corporation, limited liability partnership (LLP), or a limited liability
corporation (LLC) that is filed and recorded and in good standing with the
Secretary of State of Ohio. The provisions of this exception may be implemented
only once in any twelve (12) consecutive month period.
   (g)   When a Building Division issued registration is assigned to a business
concern, all work carried on by the registered-business shall be deemed to be
carried on under the personal supervision of the person named in the Building
Division issued registration. Therefore, any violations of the terms of the
Building Division issued registration, or of this building code, shall be
imputed to the Building Division issued registration-holder named therein. The
Building Division issued registration-holder shall be actively engaged in the
business and shall be readily available for consultation with the Building
Division within two (2) business days after notification.
   (h)   No registration-holder shall permit his or her Building Division
issued registration to be used in more than one business at any time. It shall
be cause for revocation by the Building Division of the registration issued to
a business concern if it shall be shown that the registration-holder is not, or
is no longer, a legal, full-tine officer, proprietor, partner or employee of
said business concern. No Building Division issued registration-holder shall be
entitled to be named in any Building Division issued registration who shall
have outstanding against them, as an individual, or as a full-time officer,
proprietor, partner, or employee of a business concern, any suspension or
revocation of another Building Division issued registration or Building
Division registration. However, another qualified Building Division issued
registration-holder who is a full-time, proprietor, partner or employee may be
substituted upon proper application therefore.
(Ord. C33-02. Passed 4-15-02.)
1375.14   ELECTIVE SUSPENSION (ESCROW).
   (a)   A home improvement general or limited contractor, or sewer contractor,
may place their Building Division issued registration in elective suspension
(escrow) upon a written request and payment of the fee as prescribed by the fee
schedule for such placement to the Building Division's registration section at
any time. The written request shall be submitted with his or her application
for the immediate establishment of the elective suspension (escrow) status or
to occur in lieu of their contractor registration renewal. The registration-
holder shall pay the fee as prescribed by the fee schedule and obtain a
Building Division issued contractor registration elective suspension (escrow)
renewal each year as herein before regulated. During the period of the elective
suspension (escrow) the registration-holder shall not be required to obtain or
furnish the required bond, liability insurance, the State of Ohio worker's
compensation coverage or City Income Tax Division registration. Throughout the
period of elective suspension (escrow), the registration-holder shall not
perform any work of a Building Division issued registered contractor and no
permits shall be issued to such registration-holder.
   (b)   A home improvement general or a limited contractor registration, may
be placed in elective suspension (escrow) indefinitely. However, such
registration shall be renewed each year by payment of the fee prescribed by the
fee schedule for such placement. Failure to renew a registration that is in
elective suspension (escrow) or in employment escrow status in accordance with
Section
1375.15 shall be sufficient cause for such registration to become immediately
canceled by the Building Division without recourse. Re-establishment of a home
improvement general or a limited contractor registration, shall be only
accomplished by making a new application for such Building Division issued
registration with the Building Division.
   (c)   Upon notification to the Building Division's registration section and
paying the fee as prescribed in the fee schedule, and providing evidence of
possessing the required bond, liability insurance and proof of registration
with the City Income Tax Division, the elective suspension (escrow) status of a
Building Division issued registration shall be removed. Thereafter, the
Building Division issued registered-holder may perform the work of his or her
registered craft or trade as a Building Division registered contractor and
obtain permits, or work as applicable.
(Ord. C33-02. Passed 4-15-02.)
1375.15   EMPLOYMENT ESCROW STATUS PROVISION.
   (a)   Upon a written request to the Building Division, an individual, who
has a current, valid Building Division issued registration under this Chapter
as a home improvement general or a limited contractor, and who is employed as a
full-time inspector by the Building Division, or a Ohio Board of Building
Standards certified Building Division, or a Ohio county health Building
Division, in such a related field of inspection, may place their Building
Division issued registration in a continuous employment escrow status with the
Building Division.
   (b)   The Building Division issued registration-holder shall be employed as
a full-time inspector as described heretofore for the duration of the
employment escrow status. In addition, the registration-holder will also be
exempt from the payment of any fee or renewal requirement of the Building
Division for such registration, but only for the period of time in which their
Building Division issued registration is in this employment escrow status.
   (c)   A Building Division issued registration that is in employment escrow
status shall become invalid, unless its validity is re-established within
ninety (90) calendar days after the cessation of such required inspection
employment status of the registration-holder. Re-establishment of the
registration shall occur with a written request to the Building Division for
either reactivation or elective suspension (escrow) of the Building Division
issued registration already in employment escrow status. In addition, the
payment of the prescribed fees in the fee schedule and all of the requirements
for re-establishment of the registration with the Building Division for either
a registration renewal or elective suspension (escrow) status, as applicable,
shall be required.
(Ord. C33-02. Passed 4-15-02.)
1375.16   SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (a)   Upon receiving a complaint in writing, made by any person and
subscribed to by such complainant, and sworn to affirmatively by the
complainant before an officer of the Building Division or magistrate authorized
to administer oaths, stating in substance facts indicating that a home
improvement general or a limited contractor registration-holder shall have done
any of the things herein before mentioned which constitute cause for the
suspension or revocation of his or her registration, the Secretary of the
Contractor Board of Review shall cause a copy of such complaint to be served by
certified mail on such Building Division issued registration-holder complained
of. This notice shall also identify the Contractor Board of Review that will
adjudicate the complaint, the location, time and date upon which the Contractor
Board of Review will hear such complaint. The hearing by the Contractor Board
of Review shall be at some time not later than sixty (60) calendar days after
the filing of such complaint with the Building Division.
   (b)   Concurrently, the complainant shall also be notified as to the time,
date and place of the hearing.
   (c)   At the time, place and date mentioned in such notices, the Contractor
Board of Review shall hear the testimony of such complainant, and of the
registration holder complained against, relative to the matters set forth in
such written complaint, and also the testimony of any person(s) having
knowledge of the facts and brought before such board as witness(es). All such
testimony shall be heard under the oath or affirmation of the person(s)
testifying. The Contractor Board of Review shall have the power to adjourn or
continue such hearings or to change the place thereof as the circumstances of
the particular case may require.
   (d)   The Contractor Board of Review shall determine the truth or falsity of
the matters charged in the complaint after hearing the testimony upon such
complaint. In addition, the Contractor Board of Review shall also determine
whether any violation of the terms and conditions under which the Building
Division issued registration was issued to the registration-holder complained
of has occurred. If the Contractor Board of Review determines that such
complaint is not true, or that the testimony fails to show that any violation
of the terms under which such registration was issued has been committed, the
Contractor Board of Review shall forthwith dismiss such complaint.
   (e)   If, however, it was ascertained that a violation has been committed,
the Contractor Board of Review shall have the authority to suspend, for a
period not to exceed six (6) months, or to revoke the Building Division issued
registration held by the registration-holder. Any registration-holder whose
registration shall be so revoked shall not be entitled to apply for the
issuance of a new Building Division issued registration for a period of one (1)
calendar year after the date of such revocation, and not until such former
registration-holder has corrected the cause for which such registration was
revoked or suspended, if a specific cause was stated. The penalty to be
attached in each case shall be at the discretion of the Contractor Board of
Review and within the limits prescribed herein. Any registration-holder that
shall have twice previously been found guilty of violation of the terms and
conditions of his or her Building Division issued registration shall have such
registration revoked if found guilty on a third or later complaint.
   (f)   The Secretary of the Contractor Board of Review shall notify the
Building Division's licensing section, in writing, by no later than the close
of business of the following work day after the final determination of the
Contractor Board of Review's hearing was made concerning the complaint filed
against the registration-holder.
   (g)   The decision of the Contractor Board of Review concerning a revocation
or suspension of a Building Division issued registration shall be appealed to
the Director of Safety, pursuant to Section
501.13 of this Code. Such an appeal shall be limited to the record created
during the proceeding before the applicable Contractor Board of Review.
   (h)   Following revocation, or during any period of suspension, such former
registration-holder or registration-holder shall not perform any work of a
registered contractor. The Building Division shall not issue a permit to a
Building Division issued registered contractor while under revocation or
suspension.

contractor registration under the provisions of this Chapter, and prior to each
renewal thereof, each registered specialty contractor shall, in a manner

renewal thereof, each registered specialty contractor shall register with the
Income Tax Division of the City Department of Finance. Relevant proof of such

specialty contractor registration shall not be issued or renewed without
meeting this City Income Tax Division registration requirement.

to be used by any other person either for doing work or for obtaining a permit.
No OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration holder shall allow any
person to do work under the authority of a permit granted to the registration
holder unless such other person is either a direct employee or a legally leased
trades person, which is under the direct supervision of the registration
holder.
   (b)   Exception. A registered OCIEB licensed specialty contractor of a
specific trade or craft, duly registered with the Building Division, may work
as a subcontractor of another duly registered OCIEB licensed specialty
contractor also registered with the Building Division of the same specific
trade or craft in accordance with Section
1371.05.
(Ord. C33-02. Passed 4-15-02.)
1377.11   ASSIGNMENT AND ISSUANCE.
   (a)   The registration of an OCIEB licensed specialty contractor shall not
be assigned with the Building Division. An OCIEB licensed specialty contractor
registration shall only be issued in conformity to the OCIEB specialty
contractor registration submitted with the application. If any change or
modifications to the OCIEB specialty contractor registration are needed, they
shall be made with the OCIEB prior to making an application for an OCIEB
licensed specialty contractor registration with the Building Division.
   (b)   The OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration-holder is
required to notify the Building Division immediately of any change of status of
his or her OCIEB specialty contractor registration.
   (c)   When a change is made to the OCIEB specialty contractor registration
with the Ohio Construction Industry Examining Board (OCIEB) subsequent to
obtaining a registered specialty contractor registration with the Building
Division, such change shall immediately invalidate the OCIEB licensed specialty
contractor registration issued by the Building Division to the OCIEB
registration-holder. In addition, if continued registration with the Building
Division is needed, it will require that an application be made for a new OCIEB
licensed specialty contractor registration that will conform to the changes
made in the OCIEB issued registration so as to re-establish the OCIEB licensed
specialty contractor registration with the Building Division.
   (d)   All work carried on by an OCIEB specialty contractor shall be deemed
to be carried on under the personal supervision of the person or persons named
on the OCIEB specialty contractors license. Therefore, any violations of the
terms of the Building Division OCIEB licensed specialty contractor
registration, or of this building code, shall be imputed to the person or
persons named on the OCIEB specialty contractor issued registration. The person
or persons named on the OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration shall
be readily available for consultation with the Building Division within two (2)
business days after notification.
(Ord. C33-02. Passed 4-15-02.)

to administer oaths, stating in substance facts indicating that an OCIEB
licensed specialty contractor registration-holder shall have done any of the
things herein before mentioned which constitute cause for the suspension or
revocation of their OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration, the
secretary of the Contractor Board of Review shall cause a copy of such
complaint to be served by certified mail on such OCIEB licensed specialty
contractor registration-holder complained of. This notice shall also identify

date and place of hearing.
   (c)   At the time, place and date mentioned in such notices, the Contractor
Board of Review shall hear the testimony of such complainant, and of the OCIEB
licensed contractor registration-holder complained against, relative to the
matters set forth in such written complaint, and also the testimony of any
person(s) having knowledge of the facts and brought before such Contractor
Board of Review as a witness(s). All such testimony shall be heard under the
oath or affirmation of the persons testifying. The Contractor Board of Review
shall have the power to adjourn, or continue, such hearings or to change the
place thereof as the circumstances of the particular case may require.
   (d)   The Contractor Board of Review shall determine the truth or falsity of
the matters charged in the complaint after hearing the testimony upon such
complaint. In addition, the Contractor Board of Review shall also determine
whether any violation of the terms and conditions under which the registration
was issued to the OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration-holder
complained of has occurred. If the Contractor Board of Review determines that
such complaint is not true, or the testimony fails to show that any violation
of the terms under which such registration was issued has been committed, the
Contractor Board of Review shall forthwith dismiss such complaint.
   (e)   If it was ascertained that a violation has been committed, the
Contractor Board of Review shall have the authority to suspend for period not
to exceed six (6) months, or to revoke the OCIEB licensed specialty contractor
registration held by the registered specialty contractor registration- holder.
Any OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration-holder whose registration
shall be so revoked shall not be entitled to apply for the issuance of a new
OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration for a period of one (1) year
after the date of such revocation, and not until such former registrant has
corrected the cause for which such registration was revoked or suspended, if a
specific cause was stated. The penalty to be attached in each case shall be at
the discretion of the Contractor Board of Review and within the limits
prescribed herein. Any OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration-holder
that shall have twice previously been found guilty of violation of the terms
and conditions of their registration issued by the Building Division shall have
such OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration revoked, if found guilty
on a third or later complaint.
   (f)   The Secretary of the Contractor Board of Review shall notify the
Building Division's licensing section, in writing, by no later than the close
of business of the following work day after the final determination of the
Contractor Board of Review's hearing was made concerning the complaint filed
against the registration-holder. In addition, the secretary of the Contractor
Board of Review shall also notify the Executive Secretary of the Ohio
Construction Industry Board (OCIEB) in writing, by certified mail, within
fifteen (15) calendar days after the final determination of the Contractor
Board of Review's hearing was made concerning the complaint filed against the
OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration holder.
   (g)   The decision of the Contractor Board of Review concerning a revocation
or suspension of an OCIEB licensed specialty contractor registration shall be
appealed to the Director of Safety pursuant to Section
501.13. Such an appeal shall be limited to the record created during the
proceeding before the applicable Contractor Board of Review.
   (h)   Following revocation, or during any period of suspension, such former
registration-holder or registration-holder shall not perform any work of an
OCIEB licensed registered contractor, and no permit shall be issued thereto by
the Building Division.

that was filed and recorded and in good standing with the Secretary of State of
Ohio.
      (3)   Merger or consolidation of the registered-business with a
corporation, limited liability partnership (LLP), or a limited liability
corporation (LLC) that is filed and recorded and in good standing with the
Secretary of State of Ohio.
   (g)   The provisions of this exception may be implemented only once in any
thirty-six (36) consecutive month period and shall only apply to a demolition
contractor registration.
   (h)   When a demolition contractor registration is assigned to a business
concern, all work carried on by the registered-business shall be deemed to be
carried on under the personal supervision of the registrant named in the
demolition contractor registration. Therefore, any violations of the terms of
the contractor registration or of this building code shall be imputed to the
registrant named therein. The demolition contractor registration-holder shall
be actively engaged in the business and shall be readily available for
consultation with the Building Division within two (2) business days after
notification.
   (i)   No demolition contractor registration holder shall permit his or her
contractor registration to be used in more than one business at any time. It
shall be cause for revocation by the Building Division of the contractor
registration issued to a business concern if it shall be shown that the
registrant is not, or is no longer, a legal, full-time officer, proprietor,
partner or employee of said registered business concern. No demolition
contractor registrant shall be entitled to be named in any contractor
registration who shall have outstanding against them, as an individual, or as a
full-time officer, proprietor, partner, or employee of a business concern, any
suspension or revocation of another contractor registration or Building
Division registration. However, another qualified demolition contractor
registration-holder who is a full-time, proprietor, partner or employee may be
substituted upon proper application therefore.
   (j)   Fire Alarm and Detection Equipment and/or Fire Protection Company. The
registration of a fire alarm and detection equipment and/or fire protection
company may not be assigned with the Building Division. A fire alarm and
detection equipment and/or fire protection company registration shall only be
issued in conformity to the Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal, Bureau of
Licensing and Certification issued company certification submitted with the
application. If any change or modifications to the fire alarm and detection
equipment and/or fire protection company certification are needed, they shall
be made with the State of Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal, Bureau of
Licensing and Certification prior to making an application for a fire alarm and
detection equipment and/or fire protection company registration with the
Building Division.
   (k)   The fire alarm and detection equipment and/or fire protection company
registration-holder is required to notify the Building Division immediately of
any change of status of his or her Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal fire
issued company certification.
   (l)   When a change is made to the Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal
issued company certification with the issuing agency subsequent to obtaining a
fire alarm and detection equipment and/or fire protection company registration
with the Building Division, such change shall immediately invalidate the fire
alarm and detection equipment and/or fire protection company registration
issued by the Building Division to the Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal
company certification-holder. In addition, if continued registration with the
Building Division is needed, it will require that an application be made for a
new fire alarm and detection equipment and/or fire protection company
registration that will conform to the changes made in the Ohio Division of
State Fire Marshal issued company certification so as to re-establish the Ohio
Division of State Fire Marshal fire alarm and detection equipment and/or fire
protection company registration with the Building Division.
   (m)   All work carried on by a registered fire alarm and detection equipment
and/or fire protection company shall be deemed to be carried on under the
personal supervision of the person named on the Ohio Division of State Fire
Marshal issued company certification and the applicable registered certified
individual(s) providing the validation of the category of work in Section
1379.05(b). Therefore, any violations of the terms of a Building Division
issued fire alarm and detection equipment and/or fire protection company
registration, or of this building code, shall be imputed to the person(s) named
on the Division of State Fire Marshal, Bureau of Licensing and Certification
company certification and the applicable registered certified individual(s)
providing the validation of the category of work in Section
1379.05(b). The person(s) named on the Ohio Division of State Fire Marshal
company certification and certified individuals shall be readily available for
consultation with the Building Division within two (2) business days after
notification.

   (a)   Upon receiving a complaint in writing, made by any person and
subscribed to by such complainant, and sworn to affirmatively by the
complainant before an officer of the Building Division or magistrate authorized
to administer oaths, stating in substance facts indicating that a registered
demolition contractor or registered fire alarm and detection equipment and/or
fire protection company shall have done any of the things hereinbefore
mentioned which constitute cause for the suspension or revocation of his or her
contractor or company registration, the Secretary of the Contractor Board of
Review shall cause a copy of such complaint to be served by certified mail on
such registration-holder complained of. This notice shall also identify the
Contractor Board of Review that will adjudicate the complaint, the location,

the Building Division.
   (b)   Concurrently, the complainant shall also be notified as to the time,
date and place of the hearing.
   (c)   At the time, place and date mentioned in such notices, the Contractor
Board of Review shall hear the testimony of such complainant, and of the
registration-holder complained against, relative to the matters set forth in
such written complaint, and also the testimony of any person(s) having
knowledge of the facts and brought before such board as witness(es). All such
testimony shall be heard under the oath or affirmation of the persons
testifying. The Contractor Board of Review shall have the power to adjourn, or
continue, such hearings or to change the place thereof as the circumstances of
the particular case may require.
   (d)   The Contractor Board of Review shall determine the truth or falsity of
the matters charged in the complaint after hearing the testimony upon such
complaint. In addition, the Contractor Board of Review shall also determine
whether any violation of the terms and conditions under which the registration
was issued to the registration-holder complained of has occurred. If the
Contractor Board of Review determines that such complaint is not true, or the
testimony fails to show that any violation of the terms under which such
registration was issued has been committed, the Contractor Board of Review
shall forthwith dismiss such complaint.
   (e)   If it was ascertained that a violation has been committed, the
Contractor Board of Review shall have the authority to suspend for a period not
to exceed six (6) months, or to revoke the registration held by the
registration-holder. Any registration-holder whose registration shall be so
revoked shall not be entitled to apply for the issuance of a new registration
for a period of one (1) calendar year after the date of such revocation, and
not until such former registration-holder has corrected the cause, for which
such registration was revoked or suspended, if a specific cause was stated. The
penalty attached in each case shall be at the discretion of the Contractor
Board of Review and within the limits prescribed herein. Any registration-
holder that shall have twice previously been found guilty of violation of the
terms and conditions of his or her registration shall have such registration
revoked, if found guilty on a third or later complaint.
   (f)   The Secretary of the Contractor Board of Review shall notify the
Building Division's licensing section, in writing, by no later than the close
of business of the following work day after the final determination of the
Contractor Board of Review's hearing was made concerning the complaint filed
against the registration-holder.
   (g)   The decision of the Contractor Board of Review concerning a revocation
or suspension of the registration of a demolition contractor or fire alarm and
detection equipment and/or fire protection company registration-holder shall be
appealed to the Director of Safety. Such an appeal shall be limited to the
record created during the proceeding before the applicable Director of Safety,
pursuant to Section
501.13.
   (h)   Following revocation, or during any period of suspension, such former
registration-holder or registration-holder shall not perform any work of a
registered contractor or company, and no permit shall be issued thereto by the
Building Division.
