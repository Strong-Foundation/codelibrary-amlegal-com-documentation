ADOPTING ORDINANCE
ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 16-87
PASSED July 7, 1987
Proposed by General Government Services
   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER, AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of Munroe Falls, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Council of the Municipality of Munroe Falls, Ohio, that:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Munroe Falls, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Munroe Falls, Ohio 1987.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Munroe
Falls, Ohio, 1987.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All
ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to January 18, 1987,
which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and modification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease, or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way;
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
         (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to January 18, 1987.
   Section 3. That the Clerk-Treasurer, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, shall
cause to be published in a manner required by law a summary of the new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances.
   Section 4. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and
welfare of the residents of Munroe Falls and for the further reason that there
exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication and distribution of
the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the City, so as to
facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid practical and legal
entanglements, and provided that it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds
of the members elected to Council, it shall take effect and be in full force
from and immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in full force from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Munroe Falls Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Munroe Falls Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   Notice, in writing, of each such special meeting called at the request of
the Mayor, or of the President of Council, or of any three (3) members of
Council, shall state the date and the time, and the subject or subjects to be
considered thereat. The Clerk of Council shall cause such written notice to be
served to all officials holding elective office, either personally or by
leaving a copy thereof at their usual place of residence, not less than twenty-
four (24) hours preceding the time for the meeting. In the event that a special
meeting is called by a vote of Council at any regular or special meeting from
which any member of Council is absent, written notice of such special meeting
shall be given such absentee in the manner and the form hereinbefore provided.
Service of such notice may be waived by an instrument in writing signed prior
to the hour of such meeting, and the Mayor and any Councilman shall be deemed
conclusively to have waived such notice by their attendance at any such
meeting. All special meetings of Council shall be held at the Council Chambers
and shall be open to the public.

exist, a majority of those members who are present may compel the attendance of
unexcused absent members in such manner and under such penalty as may be
prescribed by resolution.
   To determine the results of any vote of Council it shall be calculated on
the full prescribed membership of Council as stated in this Charter.
SECTION 5.12. CLERK OF COUNCIL.
   A.   The Director of Finance of the Municipality shall be the Clerk of

Council.
   B.   The Clerk of Council or a designated employee shall attend all meetings

forth in this Charter. The person elected by Council or appointed by the Mayor
shall hold the office until a successor is elected and qualified.
   A successor shall be elected and qualified by the electorate at the next

days of, or after the filing deadline for the next Municipal election, in this
event, the successor shall hold office for the balance of the unexpired term of
the member in whose office the vacancy has occurred.
(Amended 11-7-00)
SECTION 5.16.   VIRTUAL MEETINGS OF COUNCIL AND OTHER PUBLIC BODIES.
   Council, as well as any other public body of the Municipality, may elect to
meet virtually in lieu of an in-person meeting, but only in the event that the
public body first determines, by the assent of at least two-thirds of its
members, that meeting virtually is necessary due to either a public health

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
         
Chap. 171.   Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution
for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all
criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways
located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the defendant to
trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and Criminal
Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged with an
offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is such
that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. “Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto.”
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the “Ohio Traffic Rules” which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): “Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.”
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): “Where a transfer is required, the Mayor's Court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date.”
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
181.052 of this chapter or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. or (b)(1)C. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (b)(1)B. of this
section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator
not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
         C.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars
($11,999.00), or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required
to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the

            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first 15 days of a month, the third banking
day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer’s, agent’s, or other payer’s obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for Federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the Federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
181.091 of this chapter.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.

controlled by an employer.
      (6)   “Worksite location” means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this State at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. “Worksite location” does not include the home of
an employee.
      (7)   “Principal place of work” means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, “principal place of work” means
the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee’s
employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the “greatest number of days in a calendar year” performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)A. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to divisions (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of
the following conditions applies:
         A.   The employee’s principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         B.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite

time the services commence:
            1.   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than 20 days of actual services to complete the services; or
            2.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages as provided
in Section
181.051 of this chapter.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee’s principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s Federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
181.051 of this chapter.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on 12 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a “petroleum refinery” is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
      Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds 12, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first 12 days for which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on which the
individual performed services at the refinery.

providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such

gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit

      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; or
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize award at the

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before January 31, each video lottery terminal
sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is located
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with the annual
return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously
remitted. If the name, address, or Social Security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before January 31, a video lottery sales agent
shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount

and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video lottery sales agent
during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall provide to the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each information return
issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may require that such copies
be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid; or
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

returns required under this section.

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

181.19(a) of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section

      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, “wages, salaries, and

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer.
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
         C.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.

separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081 of this chapter.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
181.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to
which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         A.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section

income” for “Federal taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for
“a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
181.03(c)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the

the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation; and
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, “date of
the postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
181.091(g) of this chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth
month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

and
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the

through (c)(1)D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.091 of this chapter.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section
181.091 of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

181.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096 of this chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
181.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.

file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
181.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
181.092 of this chapter, the provision in Section
181.092 of this chapter prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
181.051(b)(1)B. or (b)(1)C. of this chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
         The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
      (3)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division

file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.

      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the National Guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the

181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
   (c)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax

   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
181.19(e) of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
($10.00) or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer.
Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to
only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer’s annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
181.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

181.096 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00); and
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18 of this chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.10(a)(4) of this chapter.
   (e)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
Section
181.10 of this chapter.

the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax

TIME.
   (a)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim; or
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.

181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person’s possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person’s Social Security number, Federal employer identification

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 of this chapter for a violation of Section
181.15 of this chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 or
by the charter or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person
shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person’s official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.

counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

181.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An “opinion of the Tax Administrator” means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an “opinion of the Tax Administrator.”
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances; or
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15 of this chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section; and
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed.

Statutory reference:
   Opinion of Tax Administrator; request, see Ohio R.C. 718.38
181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality. Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the board’s final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case, must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,

reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
181.096 of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
181.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties; or
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any

When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief

vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than $100 as follows:
         A.   1.   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer
issues an offender a ticket, citation, or summons for a violation of any of the
aforementioned sections of the Ohio Revised Code, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as of $100, so long as the offender submits to
the court both the offender’s payment in full and such written evidence within
90 days of the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the
additional fine under division (b) of this section.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
         B.   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
(R.C. § 4511.991)
   (c)   Penalties. Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
this Traffic Code shall be imprisoned for a definite term or fined, or both,
which term of imprisonment and fine shall be fixed by the court as provided in
this section.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   (c)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the

(R.C. § 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have “stop” or “yield” signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right- of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane- use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician- intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),

a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or

is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.

of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest

sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of

offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other

ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants

the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
501.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

to §
501.99(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (b)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court shall impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02.

R.C. Chapter 4507 or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under R.C.
Chapter 4506. Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
this division is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to § 698.02,

offender may be ordered pursuant to § 698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to
serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. § 2705.02(A) that may be
filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the offense, the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more
violations of this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other offense, for
which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict liability
offense.

any person to whom any of the following applies:

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person

section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a

the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within

shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a

be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,

permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the

for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).

section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03

      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and

committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   “Culpability” means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offendor’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person's conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:,
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth.”
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unicorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal
entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED OR FORFEITED PROPERTY HELD BY POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
   (a)   Safekeeping of Property in Custody.
      (1)   A.   Any property that has been lost, abandoned, stolen, seized

of when and where it may be claimed, and to return the property to them at the
earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence identifying persons entitled
to possession, it is sufficient notice to advertise in a newspaper of general

same county as the court or in a contiguous county. If no services provider is
located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (b)(3) of this section.
      (5)   A.   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under Ohio R.C. 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police
Department of the recognition by filing a copy of its resolution conferring
that recognition with the Police Department. When the Board recognizes a

the highest percentage of the Municipality’s population.
         B.   Upon being so notified, the Police Department shall pay 25% of
any forfeited proceeds or cash derived from each sale of property disposed of

501.14 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
533.98 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
533.98 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential

(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring

         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.

county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (j)(3)B.
of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
      (3)   A.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration

(R.C. § 955.22)
   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.16 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.

liability insurance pursuant to division (f) of this section. The court, in the
alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound at the
owner’s expense.
         (R.C. § 955.99(G))
      (5)   A.   Whoever commits a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a vicious dog is guilty of one of the following:
            1.   A felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the

county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (l)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that R.C. § 955.11(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that § 618.16 applies with respect to the dog as

division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall

dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was
seized. The notice shall include a statement that a security in the amount of
$100 is due to the county dog warden within ten days to secure payment of all

determination under division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the
county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security

of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.

reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an

designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
505.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   Where more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed against one
victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active duty
service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1), (2) or (3)
it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or violations of R.C. §
2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section or
that involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme
or course of conduct as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section. While
it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series
in order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)
of this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense
to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any property, real or personal, not covered under
subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair market
value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair market value”
is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would accept
for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and the
seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received thereby, is
prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(ORC 2913.61)

premises of a church or public or private elementary or secondary school, the
nearest boundary of an affected public park, residential district or
residential lot.
   (d)    For the purposes of subsection (b) of this section, the distance

is not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or
renewal of the sexually oriented business license, of a church, public or

Engineer or his designee shall cause such removal and the cost incurred shall
be paid by the permittee or deducted from his deposit.
      (9)   Every permittee shall place around the project such barriers,
barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be determined by
the City Engineer or his designee to be necessary for the protection of the
public. Additional safety requirements may be prescribed by the City Engineer
or his designee.
         Whenever any person fails to provided or maintain the safety devices
required by the City Engineer or his designee such devices shall be installed
and maintained by the Municipality. The amount of the cost incurred shall be
paid by the permittee or deducted from his deposit.
         No person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or extinguish
any warning light, barrier, sign, or notice erected, placed or posted in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (10)   Access to private driveways shall be provided except during

approximate time at which backfilling will be begun.
      (3)   No backfilling shall be accomplished until proper Municipal
inspection has been made.
      (4)   The work of the restoration, including both paving surface and
paving base, shall be performed by the permittee according to Municipal
specifications.
      (5)   If the Engineer finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street
opening may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where
a number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another, or where
the equipment used may cause such damage, he may require a negotiated
contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching of
such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area
exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the total pavement surfacing between curb
faces or between concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be
carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
      (6)   After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling
the same shall be prosecuted with due diligence.
      (7)   The City Engineer or his designee shall make daily inspections of
all work authorized by a permit. The Engineer is empowered to provide a full
time inspector if the work to be performed is of a nature that full time

shall be based on a schedule of charges on file in the Office of the Engineer.
      (9)   Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of
the permit, the permittee shall notify the City Engineer or his designee in
writing. A certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the City Engineer
or his designee in writing. The certificate of final inspection shall be issued
by the City Engineer or his designee to each permittee no sooner than one year
after the permanent restoration of the excavation has been made, provided the
work authorized by the permit has been performed according to the Municipal
specifications. Prior to the issuance of the certificate, the City Engineer or
his designee shall make a final inspection of the restoration to determine
whether Municipal specifications have been adhered to.
      (10)   If any settling in a restored area occurs within a period of one
year from date of completion of the permanent restoration, any expense incurred
by the Municipality in correcting such settlement shall be paid by the
permittee or recovered from his bond, unless the permittee submits proof
satisfactory to the City Engineer or his designee that the settlement was not
due to defective backfilling.
      (11)   In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in
the charge or care of the Municipality, or any of its officers or employees,
and no officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume any
jurisdiction over any such opening, except in the exercise of the police power,
when it is necessary to protect life and property.

deficiency, the Municipality may institute an action to recover the same in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full, no
additional permits shall be issued to such permittee.
   (d)   Yearly Deposit. Whenever any public utility or authority shall
anticipate more than one street opening or excavation per calendar year, such

streets, alleys, and other public ways and places by the public and to not
interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places.

traveling public (including pedestrians and other proper public uses). Damage
to and repair of pedestals, vaults, manholes or other facilities of the grantee

shall, without delay and at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved
by the City Engineer, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, alley, public
way, paved area, or portion of the rights-of-way (including trees, shrubbery,
and improvements thereon) to its former state of usefulness, repair and
condition, paved, seeded, mulched, replanted, or sodded in a manner and with
the same type, quality, and condition of materials that will match those
damaged, destroyed or disturbed and those of the adjacent property so that
disturbed area is in as good a condition as before the work involving such
disturbance was done. In the event grantee, after ten days advance notice,
fails or refuses to commence, pursue and complete such replacement and
restoration work, the City shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to
complete such restoration and to require grantee to pay to the City the cost of
such restoration. In the event that the restoration of the disturbed area, or
the area adjacent thereto, deteriorates at a faster rate than that which would
have occurred had grantee not damaged, destroyed or disturbed the area, then in
that event, grantee shall repair, replace, or restore such areas to their
original condition prior to the disturbance. Any such deterioration occurring
within the five-year period following the disturbance will be presumed to
result from grantee's actions and disturbance of the area. Any trees in the
disturbed area or the area adjacent thereto that die within said five-year
period will be presumed to have died as a result of grantee's actions and
disturbance of the area.

the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of any public property,
structure or facility, or to engage in any public improvement, and if as a
result thereof it is deemed necessary by the City for grantee to move,
relocate, change, alter or modify any of its facilities or structures in order
to assure the public's unencumbered continued use of the rights-of-way for
travel and other proper public uses, then in such event and upon reasonable
written notice of not less than 60 days, grantee at its sole cost shall
promptly move, relocate, change, alter or modify its facilities. In the event
grantee, after such notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue and complete
such relocation work within a reasonable time, the City shall have the
authority, but not the obligation, to move, remove, relocate, change, alter,
modify or abate such structures or facilities and to require grantee to pay to
the City the cost of such relocation, alteration, or modification. In the event
of an emergency which threatens the health or safety of the public requires the
relocation, alteration, or removal of the facilities, the City will attempt to
notify promptly the grantee and grantee shall have the right to move, alter, or
remove the facilities from the rights-of-way.
(Ord. 11-08. Passed 11-18-08.)

City, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at
the expense of the grantee.
(Ord. 11-08. Passed 11-18-08.)
919.14 JOINT PLANNING AND COOPERATION.
   (a) Grantee shall cooperate with other grantees and the City for the best,
safest, most efficient, most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the rights-
of-way, to minimize traffic and other disruptions, including street cuts, and
to achieve the most efficient utilization of, construction in and occupancy of
the rights-of-way. Grantee shall not be required to divulge trade secrets or
other competitively sensitive confidential information the release of which
would cause material injury to the grantee. Any confidential information of a
grantee in the possession of the City will be treated as such, to the extent
determined legally appropriate by the Law Director.
   (b)   Grantee shall participate in all joint planning conferences called by
the City to discuss construction projects and other matters impacting the

conduits, ducts, structures, or facilities are not reasonably available, the
grantee shall have the right to construct, install, erect and maintain its own
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities at locations as it may find
necessary for the proper construction, operation or maintenance thereof. Such
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities shall be identified and set
out in the drawings submitted with grantee's application submitted under
Section
919.06 and City approval of the grantee's application shall constitute its
approval of the construction, installation and erection of those identified
poles, conduits, ducts, structures and facilities. Grantee shall comply with
such conditions as the City may impose in approving the application and
granting any final authorization to so construct, install, locate and erect the
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities.
(Ord. 11-08. Passed 11-18-08.)

way construction permit, that it does so relying upon its own investigation and

in the event of any other dispute over the meaning thereof, the same shall be
construed strictly against grantee and in favor of the City.
(Ord. 11-08. Passed 11-18-08.)
919.20 LIABILITY INSURANCE AND BONDS.
   (a)   Grantee shall maintain, throughout the period of construction and for

rights-of-way or other public place, liability insurance insuring the City and
the grantee with regard to all damages of the type mentioned in Section
919.18 above, or otherwise, in the following minimum amounts, which insurance
or the limits of same however, shall not serve to limit the grantee's
obligations or duties to indemnify and save the City harmless as provided
herein, particularly in Section
919.18 hereof:
      (1)   One million dollars ($1,000,000) for bodily injury or death to any
one person;
      (2)   Three million dollars ($3,000,000) for bodily injury or death
resulting from any one accident or occurrence;
      (3)   Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for property damage to any
single property; and
      (4)   Three million dollars ($3,000,000) for excess liability or umbrella
coverage.
   (b)   Grantee shall furnish to the City certificates of insurance evidencing
grantee's compliance with this section. All insurance required by this chapter
shall be and remain in full force and effect for the entire term of the use of
the rights-of-way. Such insurance, if canceled for any reason, shall
immediately be put back in force subject to the terms and requirements
specified herein.
   (c)   Any insurance policy obtained by the grantee to comply with this
section must be approved by the Law Director, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and a certificate of insurance and a duplicate copy of
said insurance policy, along with written evidence of payment of required
premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the City during the term of the
use of the rights-of-way. Such insurance may be changed from time to time to
reflect changing liability limits as may be reasonably requested by the City,
but not below the minimum established herein. Grantee shall immediately notify
the City in writing of any litigation that may develop that would affect the
insurance required herein.
   (d)   Upon acceptance of the rights-of-way construction permit, grantee
shall deposit with the City a surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Law Director;
provided, however, that the Mayor, in his sole discretion, may waive or reduce
the amount of the bond. The performance bond shall be available to ensure the
faithful performance by grantee of all provisions of the rights-of-way
construction permit. The performance bond shall be maintained at fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) during the entire term of the use of the rights-of-way,
regardless of withdrawals which may be made under this section. The performance
bond shall be conditioned upon and ensure the faithful performance of grantee
of all terms and conditions of the rights-of-way construction permit and the
payment by grantee of any claim, liens, costs, expenses and taxes due the City
which arise by reason of the construction, repair or maintenance of grantees'
facilities in the rights-of-way or other public place. The rights reserved to
the City with respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other
rights the City may have under this chapter or any law. The company providing
such bond must be licensed to do business in the State of Ohio. In the event of
a default by grantee in any of its obligations under the rights-of-way
construction permit which default is not cured within ten days after notice by
the City to grantee of such default, or such longer time as it is necessary to
cure, so long as grantee commences to cure within ten days and diligently
pursues cure, the City may levy on the performance bond upon notifying grantee
of the amount of such charge. Grantee may contest in good faith any dispute
with respect to any levy by the City on the performance bond. The rights
reserved to the City with respect to the performance bond are in addition to
all other rights of the City, at law or in equity. The performance bond
provided hereunder shall contain the following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled without
thirty (30) days advance written notice to the City of Munroe Falls, Ohio.”
   (e)   Upon written request of the grantee, and joint approval of the Mayor
and Law Director, grantees who maintain a net book value in excess of fifty
million dollars ($50,000,000) may self-insure and self-bond in lieu of
maintaining and providing the policies of insurance and bonds described above.
Such grantees shall provide to the Mayor and Law Director such certificates or
other documents attesting to such book value, insurance and bonding as may be
reasonably requested.

rules of the MFWD.

within five feet of any hydrant.
   No persons, except an authorized employee of the Water Department or the
Fire Department, shall open, operate or remove the nozzle cap from any hydrant

the use of a fire hydrant for securing a supply of water for construction
purposes where a permanent connection cannot be made.

installed for this purpose whenever possible and rates for water used will be

charges of the MFWD occurring against the property until written notice shall
be given to the MFWD to discontinue the supply.
   (g)   Charges for Water Found On: Where the water has been turned off for
any reason by the MFWD, it shall be so recorded and the charge for water ceases
from that date. However, whenever water is found turned on to a service
recorded as being turned off, on the records of the MFWD, the account shall be
charged for water from the recorded date of the turn off of the service and a
fine will be levied.
   (h)   Billing and Delivery: Every account shall be charged and billed
separately, except as provided in the schedule of rates. The MFWD will deliver
bills for water and miscellaneous charges by depositing same with the post
office. Failure to receive bills shall not relieve any owner from his
obligation in the payment of such bills or constitute a claim to waiver of the
service charge.
   (i)   Payment by Tenant: If the owner of any premises so elects, he may have
his tenant or lessee pay the water and/or miscellaneous charges, as they occur.
However, such tenant or lessee does so as the agent of the owner and such owner
is not thereby relieved from payment of any bills that might occur.
   (j)   Readings for Billings:
      (1)   Readings for residential water bills shall be taken quarterly and
when closing an account. At the request of the owner, or his agent unscheduled
readings of the meters may be made upon payment of a fee of five dollars
($5.00) for each reading.

   (k)   Adjustments:
      (1)   The amount of water registered by any meter shall be charged and
paid for in full, irrespective of whether such water, after having been
registered, was lost by leakage, accident or otherwise. When meters fail to
register correctly and during the time meters are removed for test or repairs,
the charges for water will be assessed on an estimated amount based on the
average consumption shown when the meter was in proper working order.
      (2)   When upon examination, meters fail to register or the accuracy does
not meet the requirements of the MFWD, the account will be examined for a
period of one year preceding the removal. Should there be a marked difference
in consumption as shown by the defective meter and one in good repair, an
additional charge or credit for over or under registration of the meter for not
more than one year shall be made.
   (l)   Refunds and Abatements: A refund or abatement on a bill metered for
water can be made for only one of the following reasons:
      (1)   Where an error has been made in the reading of the meter or in the
preparation of the bill.
      (2)   When the meter, upon test, shows an average over-registration of
greater than two percent (2%).
      (3)   When payment was duplicated or charged incorrectly. The original
receipt must accompany the application for a refund. In general, all
overpayments will be credited to the account and shown as a credit against the
account on the next bill rendered but may, if approved by the Superintendent,
be refunded. Rebate form shall be completed by the clerk and maintained for
audit purposes.
   (m)   Complaints of Overcharge: Complaints of overcharge should be made
immediately upon receipt of the bill and before the bill is paid. All bills
against which no complaints are made shall be considered correct. Exceptions
may be made by authority of the Superintendent. However, mistakes in favor of
the MFWD, if proven, may be corrected.
   (n)   Credits to Accounts:
      (1)   Remittance to the MFWD for a given account must first be applied
against unpaid water bills.
      (2)   Bills for water must be paid in the order in which they are
contracted and accordingly, the MFWD may refuse to accept payment of a current
bill when there are one or more bills delinquent against an account. The gross
billing shall apply until all bills are current. Partial payments of water
bills will be accepted only under unusual and extraordinary circumstances.
   (o)   Bill Payment: All payments shall be in currency or by check drawn to
the order of the MFWD. All checks will be accepted subject to collection at the
bank.
   (p)   Bill Period:
      (1)   The period covered by a bill, except final bills, will terminate as
of the date of the bill.
      (2)   In computing partial bills, either on a consumption or time basis,
the date of bill will be used as the fixed date for starting or ending of a
billing period. Except that final bills, terminating within ten days after date
of bill, may be billed as of bill date. Likewise, new accounts opened within
this period may be billed from start of normal billing period.
(A.O.)
   (q)   Water Deposits.
      (1)   The deposit, less any charges due, required to obtain water service
shall be returned to the depositor by regular mail to the last known address of
the depositor or directly to the depositor if the depositor appears at the
MFWD. This deposit refund shall be paid no sooner than thirty days after water
service is terminated.
      (2)   If the MFWD is unable to pay the deposit refund as provided in
Section
921.03(q)(1), the MFWD shall keep the deposit refund for the credit of the
depositor for a period of five years. Thereafter, this deposit refund shall be
forfeited by the depositor and placed in the General Fund of the Village.

      (1)   In accordance with R.C. § 4939.0314(D), Authority of a Municipal
Corporation the City shall reserve the right to propose an alternate location
to the proposed location of a new wireless support structure, provided the
alternate location is within 100 feet or a distance equal to the width of the
right-of-way in or on which the new wireless support structure is proposed,
whichever is greater. The City also finds that certain locations and
collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location and collocation
configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should only be surpassed
if in the determination of the City Service Director or his/her designee, clear
and convincing evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone should not be
grounds for such a determination. The order of preference is as follows:

pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such pole
or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         B.   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or wireless
support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
         C.   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         D.   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
         E.   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a wireless
support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located within the
City right-of-way. If no such wireless support structure is available then
proceed to the next preference;
         F.   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an existing
pole located within the City right-of-way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         G.   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
         H.   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
         I.   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City right-of-way.

such design elements may be substituted with an alternate design element. Such
determination shall be based on the following factors:
            7.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
            8.   The design features of the existing or proposed streetscape,
district, or site;
            9.   The historical context of a district or specific site;
            10.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the pole from view.

945.01 INDIGENT BURIALS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the public
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Munroe Falls to enact an
Indigent Burial Policy to comply with the provisions of R.C. § 9: 15 pertaining
to: (i) the burial of indigent persons found within the City of Munroe Falls
who are not claimed by any person for private interment or cremation at the
person's own expense, or (ii) cremation and inurnment when the body of an
indigent person is claimed by an indigent person.
   (b)   Application.
      (1)   Unclaimed: When the body of a dead person is found within the City
and such person was not an inmate of a correctional, benevolent, or charitable
institution of this state, and the body is not claimed by any person for
private interment or cremation at the person's own expense or delivered for the
purpose of medical or surgical study or dissection in accordance with R.C. §
1713.34, then the City shall be liable for the cremation and inurnment expenses
in the amounts set forth herein, if:
         A.   The deceased is determined to be an indigent person; and
         B.   The person was a legal resident of the City of Munroe Falls at
the time of death.
      (2)   Claimed: When the body of a dead person is claimed by an indigent
person simply as that of a loved one, without undertaking to arrange and pay
for private interment, the City shall be liable for the cremation and inurnment
expenses, in the amounts set forth herein, if:
         A.   The deceased is determined to be an indigent person; and
         B.   The person was a legal resident of the City of Munroe Falls at
the time of death; and
         C.   The claimant is determined to be an indigent person.
   (c)   Administration. The Mayor or his or her designee is appointed as the
proper officer of the City, in accordance with R.C. § 9.15, to be responsible
for the administration of this indigent burial policy. If the next-of-kin of
the deceased are not available or are unknown, the Mayor or his or her
designee, shall have the authority to sign all documents necessary for
cremation and inurnment or interment expenses.
   (d)   Determining Indigence. Prior to the cremation authorization, the Mayor
or his or her designee, shall make reasonable attempt to determine whether the
deceased person is in fact indigent, and, where the deceased person is claimed
by an indigent person, whether the claimant is in fact indigent.
      (1)   Definitions: R.C. § 9.15 defines an "indigent person" as someone
whose income does not exceed 150% of the federal poverty line as revised
annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in
accordance with Section 673 (2) of the "Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1981", as amended for a family size equal to the size of the person's family.
         A.   "Indigent decedent." A deceased person whose body is found in the
City and who was a legal resident of the City at the time of death, and the
person was not an inmate of a correctional, benevolent, or charitable
institution of this State, and the body is not claimed by any person for
private interment or cremation at the person's own expense or delivered for the
purpose of medical or surgical study or dissection in accordance with R.C. §
1713.34, and the person is determined to be indigent as described herein. The
criteria used to evaluate indigency status shall include, but is not limited
to, the income components as defined by the most recent version of the United
States Census Bureau and any other relevant considerations concerning the
financial condition of the individual, including but not limited to,
fundraising revenue and/or insurance intended for funeral, cremation, and/or
burial expenses. Once the income information described herein has been
verified, then the most recent version of the United States Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guideline Publication will be used to
determine whether the person's income exceeds 150% of the federal poverty line.
In determining indigency, the wages or salary income earned by dependent minors
under eighteen years of age shall not be considered.
         B.   "Indigent claimant." A person who claims the body of an indigent
decedent and also claims he or she is indigent. The criteria used to evaluate
indigency status shall include, but is not limited to, the income components as
defined by the most recent version of the United States Census Bureau and any
other relevant considerations concerning the financial condition of the
individual, including but not limited to, fundraising revenue and/or insurance
intended for funeral, cremation, and/or burial expenses. Once the income
information described herein has been verified, then the most recent version of
the United States Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guideline
Publication will be used to determine whether the person's income exceeds 150%
of the federal poverty line. In determining indigency, the wages or salary
income earned by dependent minors under eighteen years of age shall not be
considered.
   (e)   Determining Legal Residency. Prior to the authorization of cremation,
the Mayor or his or her authorized designee, shall make reasonable attempt to
determine whether the deceased person was a legal resident of the City. As used
herein, "legal residency" means a physical presence in a particular location,
coupled with the choice to make that place home, or the place with which a
person is most intimately connected.
   (f)   Policy.
      (1)   Upon finding that the deceased was a legal resident of the City and
after verifying indigency of the decedent and the claimant of the decedent's
body, if any, as described herein, the Mayor or his or her designee, shall
authorize the funeral director to cremate the decedent. The City shall dispose
of the remains of indigent persons by cremation only. The City will choose the
funeral home to conduct the cremation and will enter into an agreement with
said funeral home for a specific price for the cremation and inurnment or
interment of the remains of the deceased. The cremated remains of the deceased
may be released to the decedent's family or loved ones.
      (2)   An indigent person claiming the body of an indigent decedent may
not make independent funeral arrangements and have the bill submitted to the
City. Should this occur, the City is not liable for costs under these
circumstances.
      (3)   If the cremated remains of indigent persons are not claimed, the
City shall cause the cremains to be buried. The City shall also provide at the
grave of the person's cremated remains, if such remains are buried, a metal,
stone, or concrete marker on which the person's name and age, if known, and
date of death shall be inscribed.

including the basement provided such home occupation shall occupy no more than
one room in the dwelling unit or an area equal to 20% of the area of the main
floor of the dwelling unit, whichever is greater. The area of an attached
garage shall not be included when calculating the area of the main floor of the

      (5)   Any activity, material, goods, or equipment indicative of the
proposed use shall be carried on, utilized or stored within the dwelling unit
and shall not be visible from any public way or adjacent property.
      (6)   The proposed use shall not create a nuisance by reason of
generating any noise, odor, dust, vibrations, fumes, smoke or electromagnetic
interference outside the dwelling.
      (7)   There shall not be any change in the outside appearance of the
building or premises, or other visible exterior change related to the home
occupation.
      (8)   There shall be no stock in trade or commodities sold except those

would endanger life or property in case of an actual fire.
      (10)   The proposed use shall not cause an increase in the use of any one
or more public utilities (water, sewer, electric, sanitation, etc.) so that the
combined use of the residence and home occupation does not exceed the average
use for residences in the neighborhood of the proposed use.
      (11)   No on-street parking shall be permitted in conjunction with the
home occupation. Customer parking shall be limited to the driveway area only.

1125.06 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The purpose of this section is to set forth regulations which control the
establishment and operation of home occupations. The intent of these
regulations is to control the nonresidential use of a residential dwelling unit
so that the nonresidential use is limited to an accessory use, and does not in
any manner whatsoever disrupt or alter the residential character of the
neighborhood in which it is located. Compliance with these regulations should
result in all home occupations being located and conducted in such a manner
that their existence is not detectable in any manner from the outside of the
dwelling unit.

or any apparatus used in the home occupation shall be conducted entirely within
the dwelling unit and no use of a garage, an accessory building or an outdoor
area shall be permitted.
      (4)   A home occupation may be conducted in any area of the dwelling
including the basement provided such home occupation shall occupy no more than
one room in the dwelling unit or an area equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
area of the main floor of the dwelling unit, whichever is greater. The area of
an attached garage shall not be included when calculating the area of the main
floor of the dwelling unit.
      (5)   Any activity, material, goods, or equipment indicative of the
proposed use shall be carried on, utilized or stored within the dwelling unit
and shall not be visible from any public way or adjacent property.
      (6)   The proposed use shall not create a nuisance by reason of
generating any noise, odor, dust, vibrations, fumes, smoke or electromagnetic
interference outside the dwelling.
      (7)   There shall not be any change in the outside appearance of the
building or premises, or other visible exterior change related to the home
occupation.
      (8)   There shall be no stock in trade or commodities sold except those
which are produced on the premises.

or waste paper, and storage of cartons and/or boxes situated in a manner that
would endanger life or property in case of an actual fire.
      (10)   The proposed use shall not cause an increase in the use of any one
or more public utilities (water, sewer, electric, sanitation, etc.) so that the
combined use of the residence and home occupation does not exceed the average
use for residences in the neighborhood of the proposed use.
      (11)   No on-street parking shall be permitted in conjunction with the
home occupation. Customer parking shall be limited to the driveway area only.
   (b)   Violations. Failure to comply with the regulations of this section

1141.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Until recent years, the regulation of all uses of land through zoning
has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more use districts.
However, the function and characteristics of an increasing number of new kinds
of land uses combined with conclusive experience regarding some of the older,
familiar kinds of uses call for a more flexible and equitable procedure for
properly accommodating the activities in the community. It should be recognized
that the forces that influence decisions regarding the nature, magnitude and
location of such types of land use activities are many and varied, depending
upon functional characteristics, competitive situations, and the availability
of land. Rather than assign all uses to special, individual and limited zoning
districts, it is important to provide controllable and reasonably flexible
requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for
the investor, but that will, at the same time, maintain adequate provisions for
the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community's
inhabitants.
   (b)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, provision is made in the
Zoning Ordinance for a more detailed consideration of each land use designated
a Conditionally Permitted Use in the District Regulations as it may relate to
the proposed conditions of location, design, size, operation, intensity of use,
generation of traffic and traffic movement, concentration of population,
processes and equipment employed, and amount and kinds of public facilities and
services required, together with many other possible factors. Review of this
information by the Planning Commission and Council is required to ensure that
each proposed Conditionally Permitted Use is consistent with the intent and
objectives of the particular district in which it is to be located.
Accordingly, conditional zoning certificates for such uses shall be issued in
compliance with the procedures and requirements of Section
1163.04.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)
1141.02 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall be
permitted in a district only when specified as a conditionally permitted use in
such district, and only if such use conforms to the following standards in
addition to any specific conditions, standards and regulations for such use or
category of uses set forth in Sections
1141.03 through
1141.07. Furthermore, the Planning Commission and Council shall review the
particular facts and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the
following standards and shall find adequate evidence that:
   (a)   The conditional use in the proposed location will be harmonious and in
accordance with the purpose, intent and basic planning objectives of this
Zoning Ordinance and with the objectives for the district in which located;
   (b)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety or general
welfare;
   (c)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity, and that such use will
not essentially change the character of the same area;
   (d)   The conditional use will not be hazardous or disturbing to the
existing and future use and enjoyment of property in the immediate vicinity for
the uses permitted, nor substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;
   (e)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location will
not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
   (f)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided;
   (g)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress designed to minimize traffic congestion on the surrounding public
streets;
   (h)   The establishment of the conditional use should not be detrimental to
the economic welfare of the community by creating excessive additional
requirements at public cost for public facilities such as police, fire and
schools;
   (i)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional use
that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted by
right that may be incompatible;
   (j)   The design and arrangement of circulation aisles, parking areas, and
access drives shall be in compliance with the Municipal Subdivision Regulations
and shall provide for interconnecting circulation among adjacent parcels.
   (k)   The conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located as well as any
specific supplemental conditions for such use set forth in Sections
1141.03 through
1141.07.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)
1141.03 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. In addition to the general criteria established in Sections
1141.01 and
1141.02, the following specific conditions pertaining to each use or group of
uses shall apply. Nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the Planning
Commission and Council from prescribing supplementary conditions and safeguards
in addition to these requirements in order to achieve the objectives
established in Section
1141.02.
   (b)   Conformance with District Regulations. A conditional use, except as
otherwise specifically provided in this Chapter or in the district regulations
for the residential district in which such use is to be located, shall conform
to such residential district regulations, and to other substantive requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance, as well as satisfy the conditions, standards and
requirements of this Chapter. Whenever there is a difference between the
provisions of the Conditional Use regulations and the district regulations, the
provisions of this Chapter shall prevail.
   (c)   Specific Area, Width and Yard Regulations.
Schedule 1141.03(c) sets forth regulations governing minimum lot area, minimum
lot width, and minimum yard dimensions for principal and accessory buildings
and parking areas for conditional uses in residential districts that require
lot area, width and yard regulations different from the residential district
regulations. Additional standards and requirements pertaining to such uses are
set forth in Sections
1141.05 to
1141.07 and are referenced in
Schedule 1141.03(c).

in no event shall such a family home be closer than 2,000 feet from where
another such home for handicapped persons is located;

1141.06 PLANNED UNIT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Purpose. A Planned Unit Residential Development (PURD) may be
conditionally permitted in an R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Residential District in
accordance with the standards and regulations established in this Zoning
Ordinance. It is the intent of this subsection to permit flexibility in the
design of single-family residential developments through departure from the
strict application of the setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements of
the residential districts, while maintaining the overall density objectives of
the Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, the flexible development standards for a
Planned Unit Residential Development shall:
      (1)   Permit a creative approach to the development of residential land;
      (2)   Accomplish a more desirable environment than would be possible
through the strict application of the minimum requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance;
      (3)   Provide for an efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks
of utilities and streets and thereby lower housing costs;
      (4)   Enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of
natural features, the provision of underground utilities, and the provision of
recreation areas and open space in excess of existing zoning and subdivision
requirements.
      (5)   Provide an opportunity for new approaches to home ownership;
      (6)   Provide an environment of stable character compatible with
surrounding residential areas;
      (7)   Provide a pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding
natural topography and geologic features and prevents soil erosion.
   (b)   Voluntary Development Procedure. Use of the Planned Unit Residential
Development is not mandatory for the development of any parcel of land. The
intent and purpose of this process is to provide a voluntary development
procedure which maximizes the utilization of land primarily for the benefit,
use, ownership and enjoyment of the future residents of that area and the
existing residents of the Municipality. In a Planned Unit Residential
Development, open space and common recreation areas and facilities are the
environmental and livability benefits furnished to the home owner and community
in lieu of large individual lots.
   (c)   Approval Criteria. A PURD shall be approved by the Planning Commission
and Council as a conditional use. In addition to the general review criteria
for conditional uses set forth in Section
1141.02. The Planning Commission and Council shall review a proposed PURD
giving particular consideration to the following:
      (1)   Uses within the proposed PURD shall be located so as to reduce any
adverse influences and to protect the residential character of areas both
within and adjacent to the PURD;
      (2)   Lot layout shall achieve the best possible relationship between the
development and the land;
      (3)   Roadway systems, entrances, exits, recreation areas and pedestrian
walkways within the PURD shall be so designed as to have access to public,
primary and secondary streets without creating traffic hazards or congestion;
      (4)   The layout of recreation areas, open spaces, public sites,
entrances, exits, yards, landscaping, signs, lighting and other potentially
adverse influences shall be designed and located to protect the residential
character within and adjacent to the PURD.
   (d)   Permitted Uses. As part of a conditionally permitted PURD, the
following uses and dwelling types shall be permitted:
      (1)   Single-family residential dwellings on subdivided lots;
      (2)   Cluster single-family residential dwellings;
      (3)   Two-family residential dwellings;
      (4)   Attached single-family residential dwelling units;
      (5)   Accessory uses provided such uses are incidental to the principal
use and do not include any activity conducted as a business.
   (e)   Land Area Requirements. The gross area of a tract of land proposed to
be developed in a PURD shall be no less than ten acres. The area proposed for
development shall be in one ownership or, if in several ownerships, the
application shall be filed jointly by all the owners of the properties included
in the plan. All land within the proposed development shall be contiguous
except as may be divided by a public street right-of-way other than a limited
access highway.
   (f)   Development Standards. A PURD approved as a conditional use may vary
from the standard requirements of the district as follows in order to achieve
the goals of this Section and of the district in which the PURD is located.
      (1)   Subdivision of Tract. The entire tract of land proposed for a PURD
shall be considered one zoning lot. Any subdivision of land within the zoning
lot following approval of the site plan, at the election of the applicant,
shall not need to comply with the lot area, lot width or yard requirements
established for the district in which the PURD is located.
      (2)   Density. The density of a PURD shall not exceed 0.8 dwelling units
per acre in an R-1 District, provided that on any single acre within the R-
1 District the density shall not exceed 4 dwelling units per acre. The density
of a PURD shall not exceed 1.9 dwelling units per acre in an R-2 District, 2.3
dwelling units per acre in an R-3 District, and 2.6 dwelling units per acre in
an R-4 District, provided that on any single acre within an R-2, R-3 or R-
4 District the density shall not exceed 6 dwelling units per acre. The total
number of units permitted shall be calculated by multiplying the total land
area by the density permitted per acre.
      (3)   Distance from Project Boundary Lines. All dwelling units shall be
located no closer than 25 feet to a proposed public right-of-way and 25 feet to
the side and rear lot lines of the project boundary. Dwelling units fronting on
an existing public street shall comply with the minimum front yard depth
established for the district in which the PURD is located.
      (4)   Spacing Between Buildings. Two or more individual buildings within
the PURD, including attached terraces, decks and patios, shall be separated
from one another by a minimum distance of 10 feet, or equal to one-half the
building wall overlap whichever is greater, provided that when the walls of one
or both buildings contain living room, bedroom or dining room windows, the
separation shall be 60 feet. In no case shall the separation be required to
exceed 60 feet.
      (5)   Open Space Requirements. A minimum of 20 percent of the total area
in a proposed PURD shall be devoted to public and/or private open space,
preservation areas, recreational areas, or recreational facilities.

either be:
            1.   Dedicated to the Municipality for park purposes of any open
space of five acres or more subject to its acceptance by Council.
            2.   Dedicated to a Homeowner's Association. An incorporated, non-
profit organization operating under recorded land agreements through which each
home owner in the PURD is automatically a member; and each lot is automatically
subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for the
organization's activities, such as maintaining a common property; and the
charge, if unpaid, becomes a lien against the property.
            3.   Held in corporate ownership by owners of the project area, for
the use of each owner who buys property within the development.
         D.   The legal articles relating the organization of the homeowners
association are subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission and
Council and shall provide adequate provisions for the perpetual care and
maintenance of all common areas.
         E.   The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall
be specified by the developer before approval of the final development plan.
         F.   Such open space, including any recreational facilities proposed
to be constructed in such space, shall be clearly shown on the development
plan.
      (6)   Public Improvement Requirements. Central sanitary sewer and water
facilities shall be provided for all units within the PURD. All utilities,
including telephone, cable television, and electrical systems, shall be located
underground within the limits of the PURD. Appurtenances to these systems which
can be effectively screened may be exempted from this requirement if the
Planning Commission and Council find that such exemption will not violate the
intent or character of the proposed PURD.
      (7)   Additional Standards. Additional site specific development
requirements formulated to achieve the objectives of these regulations shall be
established at the time the conditional use request and development plan are
reviewed. Any dimensional specifications adopted with such plan become binding
land use requirements for the PURD and shall supersede those contained in the
district regulations.
   (g)   Supplemental Requirements. A PURD shall comply with the following
supplemental requirements.
      (1)   Landscaping. All street right-of-ways and common open space shall
be landscaped according to an overall plan and shall be implemented by phases
as units are completed and weather permits. Natural wooded areas shall be
preserved and maintained for landscaping and screening to the greatest extent
possible.
      (2)   Topography - Natural Features. The PURD shall be designed to take
advantage of the topography of the land in order to utilize the natural
contours, and to minimize destruction of water courses, natural vegetation,
trees, and topsoil.
      (3)   Grading. Grading and site preparation for areas other than building
sites, streets, sidewalks and utilities shall be limited to disturbing the
minimum amount of vegetation and other topographic features.
      (4)   Development Layout. Streets and cul-de-sacs shall be laid out so as
to utilize natural contours and discourage through and high speed traffic.
      (5)   Circulation.
         A.   Wherever possible, the major vehicular and pedestrian circulation
patterns shall be completely separate and independent from one another.
         B.   Street and sidewalk alignments, and the alignments for utilities
should be parallel to contours, in valleys or on ridges where possible, in
common open areas, and, as permitted by the Planning Commission and Council, in
areas served by private drives or cul-de-sac streets.
      (6)   Phased Development. If the development is to be implemented in
phases, each phase shall have adequate provision for access, parking, storm
water management and other public improvements to serve the development in
accordance with the applicable criteria set forth. Each phase shall be provided
with temporary or permanent transitional features, buffers, or protective areas
in order to prevent damage to completed phases, to future phases and to
adjoining property. A performance bond on the total improvements and amenities
shall be furnished to the City prior to initiating construction on the first
phase of the development.
   (h)   Procedures. A proposal for a PURD shall comply with the following
administrative provisions.
      (1)   Site Plan Review, Approval and Conformance. A site plan for a PURD
shall be required as set forth in
Chapter 1163 in order to evaluate a project's compatibility with the
surrounding land uses and its compliance with these regulations. Such site plan
shall be approved by Planning Commission and Council.
      (2)   Significance Of An Approved Plan. An approved site plan shall
become for the PURD a binding commitment of the specific elements approved for
development. The approved site plan may be transferred to another person,
corporation, or group of individuals or corporations prior to the issuance of a
building permit. Such a transfer shall occur only upon approval of City
Council. A request for such a transfer or change of ownership shall be
presented to City Council and granted only if the new ownership entity
satisfies the administrative, financial, legal and all other performance
guarantees approved with the original site plan.
      (3)   Changes to An Approved Plan. All construction and development under
any building permit shall be in accordance with the approved site plan. Any
departure from the approved plans shall be cause for revocation of the
conditional zoning certificate. Any changes in approved plans shall be
resubmitted for approval in accordance with these PURD regulations.

1142.01 PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of amending this chapter of the City of Munroe Falls
Zoning Code is to maintain local control over consideration of variance
requests in certain riparian areas. It is in the best interest of the City of
Munroe Falls to allow flexibility in the implementation of this chapter, and to
reduce the need for variance requests from the specific provisions of this
chapter, and thereby promote environmental quality; and
   (b)   It is hereby determined that the system of streams within the City of
Munroe Falls contributes to the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the City of Munroe Falls. The purpose of this chapter is to
protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the City of Munroe
Falls and to protect residents of the City of Munroe Falls from property loss
and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream. The method of
implementing this chapter is by controlling uses and developments within the
riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area to:
      (1)   Reduce the flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the
velocity of floodwaters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the
downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter the
stream.
      (5)   Provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream
channels.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (7)   Provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide
array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the City of Munroe Falls economically by minimizing
encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams and riprap, to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents, and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and to the environment of the City of Munroe Falls, the
quality of life of the residents of the City of Munroe Falls and corresponding
property values.
      (9)   Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City
of Munroe Falls.
   (c)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect these riparian
areas by providing reasonable controls governing the structures and uses in
riparian setbacks.

activities thereby making it unfavorable for themselves. They are gradually
replaced by a different group of plants and animals better adapted to the new
environment.
   (i)   "Noxious weed." Any plant defined as a "noxious weed and rank
vegetation" in Section
521.15 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Munroe Falls, County of
Summit, Ohio.

established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate wetland
quality and function.
   (k)   "100-year floodplain." Any land susceptible to being inundated by
water from a base flood, which is a flood that has a one percent or greater
chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For the purposes of
these regulations, the 100-year floodplain shall be defined by FEMA and
approved by the County of Summit Department of Building Standards.
   (l)   "Ordinary high water mark (OHWM)." The point of the bank or shore to
which the presence and action of surface water is so continuous as to leave a
district marked by erosion, destruction or prevention of woody terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized
characteristic. The ordinary high water mark defines the channel of a stream.
   (m)   "Pollution." Any contamination of alteration of the physical,
chemical, or biological properties of any waters that will render the waters
harmful or detrimental to public health, safety or welfare; domestic,
commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, or other legitimate
beneficial uses; livestock, wildlife, including birds, fish or other aquatic
life.
      (1)   "Point source" pollution is traceable to a discrete point or pipe.
      (2)   "Non-point source" pollution is generated by various land use
activities rather than from an identifiable or discrete source, and is conveyed
to waterways through natural processes, such as rainfall, storm runoff, or
ground water seepage rather than a direct discharge.

and which, if approved, permits proceeding with the preparation of the final
plat.
   (o)   "Riparian area." A transitional area between flowing water and
terrestrial ecosystems, which provides a continuous exchange of nutrients and
woody debris between land and water. This area is at least periodically
influenced by flooding. Riparian areas, if appropriately sized and managed,
help to stabilize banks, limit erosion, reduce flood size flows and/or filter
and settle out runoff pollutants, or perform other functions consistent with
the purpose of these regulations.
   (p)   "Riparian setback." The area set back from each bank of a stream to
protect the riparian area and stream from impacts of development, and
streamside residents from impacts of flooding and land loss through erosion.
Riparian setbacks are those lands within City of Munroe Falls that fall within
the area defined by the criteria set forth in these regulations.
   (q)   "Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD)." An entity organized
under R.C. Chapter 1515 referring to either the Soil and Water Conservation
District Board or its designated employees, hereinafter referred to as the
Summit SWCD.

other alteration of the earth's surface where natural or human made ground
cover is destroyed and which may result in, or contribute to, erosion and
sediment pollution.
   (s)   "Stream." A surface watercourse with a well-defined bed and bank,
either natural or artificial, which confines and conducts continuous or
periodical flowing water (R.C. § 6105.01) in such a way that terrestrial
vegetation cannot establish roots within the channel.
   (t)   "Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)." The plan which
describes all the elements of the stormwater strategy implemented during and
after construction. The plan addresses erosion control and stormwater quality.
   (u)   "Stormwater quality treatment." The removal of pollutants from urban
runoff and improvement of water quality, accomplished largely by deposition and
utilizing the benefits of natural processes.

conditions peculiar to certain property and not the result of the action of the
applicant, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in undue
hardship to the applicant.
   (w)   "Watercourse." A natural or artificial waterway, such as a stream or
rivers, with a defined bed and channel and a definite direction of course that
is contained within, flows through, or borders the community.
   (x)   "Watershed." An area of land that drains into a particular
watercourse, usually divided by topography.
   (y)   "Wetlands." Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under
normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and
similar areas.
   (z)   "Wetback setback." The area set back from each bank of a wetland to
protect the sensitive ecological habitat from impacts of development,
including, but not limited to, residential/ commercial/industrial/institutional
from impacts that may lead to flooding and land loss through erosion.

1142.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF A DESIGNATED WATERCOURSE, RIPARIAN, AND WETLAND
SETBACK.
   (a)   Riparian setbacks are established as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   Streams addressed by this chapter are those which meet the definition
of "stream" in Section
1142.04 of these regulations and are indicated on at least one of the following
maps:
      (1)   USGS topographical map.
      (2)   Summit County Riparian Setback map.
      (3)   Soils maps located in the Soil Survey for Summit County, Ohio,
USDA, NRCS.
   (c)   Widths of riparian setbacks are measured as horizontal map distance
outward from the ordinary high water mark on each side of a stream, and are
established as follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 300 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 100 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 20 square miles and up to 300 square miles.
      (3)   A minimum of 75 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.5 square mile (320 acres) and up to 20 square miles.
      (4)   A minimum of 50 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
greater than 0.05 square mile (32 acres) and up to 0.5 square mile (320 acres).
      (5)   A minimum of 30 feet on each side of all streams draining an area
less than 0.05 square mile (32 acres).
   (d)   The following are exempt from the terms and protection of this
chapter: grassy swales, roadside ditches, drainage ditches created at the time
of a subdivision to convey stormwater to another system, tile drainage systems,
and stream culverts.
   (e)   The following shall apply to the riparian setback:
      (1)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than the riparian setback on
either or both sides of the stream, the riparian setback shall be extended to
the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain shall be
defined by FEMA and approved by the County of Summit Department of Building
Standards.
      (2)   Because the gradient of the riparian corridor significantly
influences impacts on the stream, adjustment for steep slopes will be
integrated into the riparian setback formulae for width determination:
 
Average Percent Slope Width of Setback
15% - 20%             Add 25 feet
21% - 25%             Add 50 feet
>25%                  Add 100 feet
 
      (3)   Average streambank slope shall be calculated using the methodology
outlined in the Ohio Supplement to Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
Technical Release Number 55 (TR-55) by USDA, NRCS.
   (f)   Designated wetlands shall include those wetlands meeting any one of
the following criteria:
      (1)   All wetlands ranked by an appropriate wetland evaluation
methodology as Ohio EPA Category 2.
      (2)   All wetlands ranked by an appropriate wetland evaluation
methodology as Ohio EPA Category 3.
   (g)   Wetland setbacks on designated wetlands are established as follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 50-feet surrounding all Ohio EPA Category 3 wetlands.
      (2)   A minimum of 30-feet surrounding all Ohio EPA Category 2 wetlands.
      (3)   No additional setback will be required adjacent to Category 1
wetlands.
   (h)   The following conditions shall apply in wetland setbacks:
      (1)   Wetland setbacks shall be measured in a perpendicular direction
from the defined wetland boundary.
      (2)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified professional under
guidelines established by the US Army Corps of Engineers and Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency and the delineation approved by the appropriate agencies. All
wetland delineations shall also include the latest version of the Ohio Rapid
Assessment Method for wetland evaluation approved at the time of application of
the regulations.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, the wetland
setback shall be preserved in its natural state.
   (i)   The applicant shall be responsible for delineating the applicable
setbacks, including any expansions or modifications as required by divisions
(b) through (d) of this section, and identifying this setback on all
subdivisions, land development plans, and/or building permit applications. This
delineation shall be done at the time of application of the preliminary plans,
or all plans that are required, or at the time of submission of any permit
applications. This delineation shall be subject to review and approval by the
authorized enforcement agent and/or the Summit SWCD. As the result of this
review, the Summit SWCD may require further studies from the applicant.
   (j)   Setbacks shall be delineated on all submitted site plans. The site
plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer, surveyor, landscape
architect, or such other qualified professional as determined by the authorized
enforcement agent and shall be based on a survey of the affected land. Two
copies of the site plan shall be submitted. The site plans shall include the
following information:
      (1)   The boundaries of the lot with dimensions.
      (2)   The locations of all designated watercourses.
      (3)   The limits, with dimensions, of the riparian setbacks.
      (4)   The existing topography at intervals of two feet.
      (5)   The location and dimensions of any proposed structures or uses,
including proposed soil disturbance, in relationship to all designated
watercourses.
      (6)   North arrow, scale, date, and stamp bearing the name and
registration number of the qualified professional who prepared the site plan.
      (7)   Other such information as may be necessary for the City of Munroe
Falls to ensure compliance with this regulation.
   (k)   Prior to any soil disturbing activity, the riparian setback shall be
clearly delineated with construction fencing or other suitable material by the
applicant on site, and such delineation shall be maintained throughout soil-
disturbing activities. The delineated area shall be maintained in an
undisturbed state unless otherwise permitted by these regulations. All fencing
shall be removed when a development project is completed.
   (l)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the City of Munroe Falls
prior to delineation of the riparian setback in conformance with these
regulations.
   (m)   Upon completion of an approved subdivision, the riparian setback shall
be permanently recorded on the plat records for the County of Summit.

for individual landowners.
         C.   Roadway crossings for major and minor subdivisions, open space
subdivisions, or any other non-single family residential use shall be
designated and constructed per the County of Summit Engineer's design standards
and as approved by the Summit County Planning Commission and approving City. If
more than two crossings per 1,000 linear feet of stream center is required for
these areas, the applicant must apply for a variance.
         D.   All roadway crossing shall be perpendicular to the stream flow
and shall minimize disturbance to the riparian setback and shall mitigate any
necessary disturbances.
      (3)   Stormwater retention or detention facilities. For these management
facilities the authorized enforcement agent may be considered within the
riparian setback if:
         A.   Stormwater quality treatment that is consistent with current
state standards is incorporated into the basin.
         B.   The stormwater quality treatment basin is located at least 50
feet from the ordinary high water mark of the stream.

the ordinary high water mark of the streams as determined by these regulations
shall have the burden of proof in case of any such appeal.
(Ord. 06-08. Passed 5-20-08; Ord. 2022-12. Passed 12-6-22.)
1142.10 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACK.
   (a)   Applications for variances to the provisions of this chapter shall be
submitted as City of Munroe Falls Zoning Inspector for review by the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   The City Board of Zoning Appeals may consult with representatives from
the Summit SWCD; the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Natural
Areas; the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water; the
County of Summit Engineer; the Department of Environmental Services of Summit
County; the Summit County Health Department; or other technical experts as
necessary to consider variance requests.
   (c)   No variances shall be granted for expansion of the following
structures or uses:
      (1)   Facilities which use, store, distribute, or sell petroleum-based
products or any hazardous materials. Such facilities include, but are not
limited to: asphalt plants, dry cleaners, gasoline services stations, and road
maintenance facilities.
      (2)   Facilities which use, store, distribute, or sell products which may
contribute higher than acceptable concentrations of dissolved or particulate
matter to stormwater runoff around the facility. Such facilities include, but
are not limited to: landfills or transfer stations, junk yards, recycling

and road salt storage barns.
   (d)   In reviewing whether to grant variances, the City Board of Zoning
Appeals shall consider the following:
      (1)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the ecological
functions of the surrounding area, including but not limited to flood control,
water quality protection or other functions deemed beneficial to maintain the
area within the setback limits. This determination shall be based on sufficient
technical and scientific evidence as provided by the applicant and the agencies
listed in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The degree of hardship these regulations place on the applicant and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this regulation, placed on the landowner by this
regulation and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or
use.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the City of Munroe Falls. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or
concrete paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel
driveways when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
City of Munroe Falls, will be made unbuildable because of this regulation.

* High Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet species surviving when flooded
or exposed to high water table more than 40% of the growing season.
* Moderate Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet species surviving when
flooded or exposed to high water table more than 30% of the growing season
but less than 40%.
* Intermediate Flood Tolerance: Generally lowland wet-mesic species surviving
occasional inundation or elevated water table between 20% and 30% of the
growing season.
* Low Flood Tolerance: Generally upland mesic and mesic-dry species rarely
inundated or exposed to an elevated water table for periods of short
duration, between 5% and 20% of the growing season.
* No Flood Tolerance: Generally upland dry species exhibiting immediate and
rapid decline frequently culminating in death if inundated or exposed to
elevated water table for more than 5% of the growing season.
** Shade Tolerance: Shade tolerance means able to grow in a state of health
and vigor beneath dense shade. In this ranking, shrubs and vines are ranked
on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very shade tolerant, and 5 being very
shade intolerant.

Ch. 351
1143.01 OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   In all districts, in connection with every building or part thereof
hereafter created, off-street parking facilities shall be provided as
prescribed by this chapter.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)
1143.02 PURPOSE.
   Off-street parking regulations are established in order to protect
residential neighborhoods from on-street parking; to promote the general
convenience, welfare and prosperity of commercial developments; and to relieve
congestion so the streets can be utilized more fully for movement of vehicular
traffic. Therefore, accessory off-street parking spaces shall be provided as a
condition precedent to the occupancy or use of any building, structure or land.
At any time a building, structure or use of land is enlarged, expanded or
increased in capacity or use, additional off-street parking spaces shall be
provided in conformance with the following provisions.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)
1143.03 UNITS OF MEASURE.
   In computing the number of parking spaces required by this Chapter, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Floor Area. Where floor area is designated as the standard for
determining parking space requirements, gross floor area shall be used for all
land uses.
   (b)   Seating Capacity. Where seating capacity is the standard for
determining parking space requirements, the capacity shall mean the number of
seating units installed or indicated, or when fixed seats are not indicated,
the capacity shall be determined as being one seat for each 20 square feet of
floor area of the assembly room. Where the Fire Code establishes a greater
maximum seating capacity, the number of spaces provided shall comply with the
Fire Code maximum seating capacity.
   (c)   Employees. Where employees are the standard for determining parking
space requirements, employees shall mean the maximum number of employees on any
two successive shifts.
   (d)   Fractional Numbers. Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next
whole number.
   (e)   Parking for Mixed Uses. The parking spaces required for mixed uses
shall be the sum of the parking required for each use considered separately.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)
1143.04 REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS.
   The required number of off-street parking spaces for each facility or use
shall be determined by application of the standards noted in
Schedule 1143.04. For a use not specified in
Schedule 1143.04, the Planning Commission shall apply the standard for a
specified use which the Commission determines to be most similar to the
proposed use.

Notes to
Schedule 1143.04
(a)   A minimum of five spaces is required for each facility other than a
single-family or two-family dwelling.
(b)   For the purposes of this Section, a shopping center shall include one or
more multi-tenant building(s) and/or group of buildings where the required
parking spaces are provided in a shared parking lot.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)
1143.05 MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.
   Whenever the parking requirements for a proposed use based on the
application of the standards specified in
Schedule 1143.04 can be shown by the applicant to result in an excessive number
of parking spaces and that a lesser number of spaces is appropriate and
consistent with these regulations, the Planning Commission may approve a site
plan with a reduction in the required spaces according to the following
provisions:
   (a)   Shared Parking for Mixed Uses. The shared use of required parking
spaces may be permitted for uses that are not normally open, used or operated
during the same hours, provided that not more than fifty percent (50%) of the
required parking spaces are shared. In any case where the required parking
spaces are collectively or jointly provided and used, a written agreement
thereby assuring their retention for such purposes shall be properly drawn and
executed by the parties concerned, approved as to form by legal counsel, and
filed with the application for zoning approval.
   (b)   Deferred Construction of Required Spaces. If the number of parking
spaces required in
Schedule 1143.04 is substantially larger than the number anticipated by the
applicant and the applicant provides sufficient evidence that supports the
reduced parking needs, a site plan may be approved with a lesser number of
parking spaces provided:
      (1)   That the total number of spaces initially provided shall not be
less than seventy percent (70%) of the spaces required by
Schedule 1143.04 for industrial uses and forty percent (40%) of the spaces
required for commercial uses.
      (2)   That suitable area(s) are reserved for the construction of the
balance of the total number of spaces otherwise required by
Schedule 1143.04 and shall be illustrated on the site plan in locations and
with landscaping in full compliance with this Chapter.
      (3)   That Planning Commission and Council, upon reevaluation of the
project's parking needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the
landbanked spaces be constructed.
      (4)   That any additional parking shall be provided according to the
approved site plan and only after approval of the construction plans by the
city engineer.
1143.06 REGULATIONS FOR ACCESS DRIVES.
   Each parking space and loading space shall be provided access in accordance
with the following:
   (a)   Number of Drives. Each lot shall be permitted one two-way access drive
or a pair of one-way drives. For lots with more than 150 feet of frontage on
one street, one additional two-way drive or pair of one-way drives may be
permitted.
   (b)   Width. The width of access drives for multi-family dwellings and non-
residential uses shall be not less than 10 feet per exit lane and 15 feet per
entrance lane and shall have a total width of not more than 36 feet, measured
at the property line. Single-family and two-family residential uses shall have
an access drive with a minimum width of ten feet.
   (c)   Location. Access drives shall be located to minimize traffic
congestion and avoid undue interference with pedestrian access to street
corners; access drives on corner lots shall be located as far from the street
intersection as practicable; and no access drive shall be located within 50
feet of street intersections as measured from the intersection of the street
right-of-way lines.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95)

provided in accordance with the following standards and specifications:
   (a)   Parking Space Dimensions. Each off-street parking space, open or
enclosed, shall have an area of not less than 162 square feet (measuring 9 feet
by 18 feet) exclusive of access drives or aisles. When such parking space is
adjacent to a landscaped area, the parking space shall have a minimum area of
153 square feet (measuring 9 feet by 17 feet).
      (1)   Residential enclosed parking areas. Each enclosed off street
parking space in a residential use district including but not limited to
garages and carports shall conform to the parking space dimensions described in
the garage regulations of the residential district in which the enclosed
parking space is located.
      (2)   Residential Garage Building Setback. Every residential garage shall
have a minimum of 25 feet between the face of the garage and the back of any
curb, back of sidewalk or any common or shared driveway.
   (b)   Queuing Space Dimensions. Each off-street queuing space for a drive-
thru facility shall have an area not less than 160 square feet (measuring 8
feet by 20 feet) exclusive of access drives and parking aisles and shall not
interfere with parking or circulation.
   (c)   Circulation Aisles. The minimum width for a circulation aisle shall
be:

with adequate drainage facilities so that the adjacent properties and rights-
of-way shall not be subject to flooding by run-off water from the proposed
parking area.
   (f)   Lighting. All lighting used to illuminate such parking areas shall be
so arranged as to direct the light away from adjoining properties or streets,
and no open light sources such as the stringing of light bulbs shall be
permitted.
   (g)   Wheel/Bumper Guards. Curbing, wheel guards or bumper guards as may be
necessary shall be provided in connection with any off-street parking area of
five cars or more, to contain the cars on sloping surfaces; to prevent bumper
over-hang or other encroachment into the required specific setback spaces.
   (h)   Screening of Parking Lots. All sides of a parking lot accommodating
five or more vehicles within or abutting a residential district shall be
screened from view by one or a combination of the following having a height of
not less than 4 feet 6 inches.
      (1)   Dense planting that is effective all year long;
      (2)   Solid wall or fence;
      (3)   Landscaped mound or berm.
      Materials used in any ornamental wall or fence shall be compatible with
the character of the proposed development and abutting properties.

shall provide landscaped islands of an area equal to five percent (5%) of the
parking lot area. Landscaped islands shall be a minimum of 10 feet by 10 feet
and have one major shade tree with a clear trunk height of at least 6 feet and
a minimum caliper of 2 inches. Shrub plantings adjacent to a building along the
perimeter of the parking lot, or in any part of a yard, shall not be counted as
interior landscaping. For the purpose of this Section the area of a parking lot

parking plans, including landscaping, shall be approved by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 05-2006. Passed 4-18-06.)

public property shall not be used for loading purposes nor shall vehicles be
parked on such areas during loading and unloading.

1145.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the general health, safety and
welfare of the community by providing an instrument for protecting the physical
appearance of the community and for encouraging high quality, effective
graphics for purposes of navigation, information and identification. It is the
intent of this chapter to provide businesses in the City with reasonable and
equitable sign standards in accordance with fair competition and aesthetic
standards acceptable to the community, and to provide the public with a safe
and effective means of locating businesses, services, areas and points of
interest in the City. This chapter is based on the premise that signs are as
much subject to control as are noise, odors, debris and similar characteristics
of land use, and that if signs are not controlled and regulated, they can
become a danger to the public, as well as a nuisance to adjacent properties or
the community in general or depreciate the value of other properties in the

   For purposes of these regulations, a sign shall include any identification,
description, illustration or device which is affixed to or integrated into a
building, structure or land, or otherwise situated on a lot and which is
intended to direct or attract attention to, or announce or promote a product,
place, activity, person, institution or business by means of letters, works,
designs, colors, symbols, flags, banners, fixtures, images or illuminations.
Signs shall be further classified by physical design or structure, and function
or purpose based on the following:
   (a)   Physical Characteristics.
      (1)   Changeable copy sign: A sign such as a bulletin board or
announcement board, where the message or graphics is not permanently affixed to
the structure, framing or background and may be periodically replaced or
covered over manually. Copy or lettering is designed to be changed on a
frequent basis. Multi-tenant business ID signs are not changeable copy signs.
      (2)   Free-standing sign: A sign which is supported by one or more
uprights or braces in or upon the ground and is not supported by a building.

      (5)   Window sign: A sign on the inside of a building affixed to, or
near, a window or transparent door for the purposes of being visible to and
read from the outside of the building.
      (6)   Electronic changeable copy sign: A free-standing sign display
comprised of small illuminated components that enable the display to change
periodically and which shall have the following characteristics:
         A.   Has a static image for at least 60 seconds for signs located
within all residential districts or the park district or has a static image for
at least 15 seconds for signs located within any other zoning district.
         B.   Does not display any illumination that moves or appears to move,
included animated, flashing, scrolling intermittent or full motion video
elements.
         C.   Will adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change or
be provided with a means to adjust brightness with a time clock.
         D.   When located within 300 feet of any residential district or the
park district, the sign shall be provided with an automatic means to turn off
from 11:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.
         E.   No electronic changeable copy sign shall be permitted on any
temporary sign, wall sign or window sign.
   (b)   Function.
      (1)   Builder's project sign: A temporary sign erected on a building site
during the time of construction. Such signs may include a description of the
project, and may list the owners, architects, engineers, developers,
contractors and/or subcontractors.
      (2)   Directive sign: A sign located on private property, at or near the
public right-of- way to direct traffic onto private property, usually
indicating the entrance and exit to a parking lot.

of a lot, building, or building unit according to the following:
         A.   Business identification sign: A sign indicating the business name
or logo of a commercial or industrial enterprise and limited to identification
purposes.
         B.   Institution identification sign: A sign displaying the name and/
or organization occupying the premises of a public or quasi-public use
restricted to: church or other place of religious worship; hospital; nursing
home; public or non-profit corporation owned and operated recreational
facilities; governmentally owned and facilities; schools.
         C.   Residential identification sign: A sign identifying the name and
address of a completed residential subdivision, or a PURD or multi-family
development with 12 or more dwellings units.
         D.   Municipal identification signs: A sign identifying the name of
the municipality and/or municipal property.
      (4)   Instructional sign: A sign that has a purpose secondary to the use
on the lot that is intended to instruct employees, customers or users as to
specific parking requirements; the location or regulations pertaining to
specific activates on the site or in the building; specific services offered,
or methods of payments accepted. Examples of instructional signs include “Honk
Horn for Service”, “Restrooms Inside”, “Parking for Customers Only”, “Parking
for Residents Only”, menu boards, drive- up tellers, and “self-service” signs.

1145.03 COMPUTATIONS.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height.
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension.
      (1)   For a sign which is framed, outlined, painted and otherwise
prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area
shall include the entire portion within the outside dimensions of the
background or frame.
      (2)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, or elements on
a wall or similar surface, or an irregularly shaped free-standing sign, the
area of a sign shall encompass a regular, or a combination of regular geometric
shapes which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all the elements in the
display. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but the
elements are separated by open space, the area shall be calculated by
determining the geometric form or combination of forms which comprise all the
display area, including the space between the elements.
      (3)   The sign shall include the frame, but shall not include the pole or
other necessary structural support.
      (4)   A freestanding sign shall have no more than two display surfaces
provided that the two display surfaces are arranged back-to-back, and not more
than 12 inches from each other. Each display surface shall be considered a sign
face.
      (5)   In the event there is a dispute in determining the sign area or any
sign dimension, the Planning Commission shall have the final responsibility for
making such determination.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be
measured from the base of the sign or supporting structure at normal grade to
the top of the highest element.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage. The building wall that faces the street
or that contains the main entrance to the use(s) in the building shall be
considered the front of the building. When used as the basis for determining
sign area, the building frontage shall be calculated according to the
following:
      (1)   The building frontage shall be measured along the front wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)   The case of an irregular wall surface, a straight line extended
along the front wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)   For lots fronting on two or more streets, or where the building has
its main entrance on a wall other than the wall that faces the street, the
building frontage shall be calculated separately for each building wall facing
a street or having a main entrance. The sign area that is located on a
particular building wall shall not exceed the area permitted for such building
wall.
      (4)   For multi-tenant buildings, the portion of a building that is owned
or leased by a single tenant shall be considered a building unit. The building
frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party
walls defining the building unit.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95; Ord. 25-2012. Passed 9-18-12.)
1145.04 MAXIMUM SIGN AREA PERMITTED.
   Signs as permitted in the respective zoning districts shall conform to the
maximum area limitations set forth in
Schedule 1145.04, except as specified below.
   (a)   Business Identification Signs. The maximum permitted area for business
identification signs shall be one square foot for each lineal foot of building
frontage. The maximum permitted area shall be the sum total of the areas of all
identification signs including wall signs, free-standing identification signs,
and window signs for second-story tenants, and shall include the area of
instructional signs unless the Planning Commission, as authorized, determines
such instructional signs are exempt pursuant to division (b) of this section.
   (b)   Instructional Signs. The area of instructional signs that are clearly
intended for instructional purposes and, as determined by the Planning
Commission, as authorized, are not larger than necessary to serve the intended
instructional purpose nor are in locations or possess design characteristics
that constitute or serve the purposes of an identification sign shall not be
included in the sum total of the area of identification signs.
   (c)   Institutional Identification Signs. For an institutional use in a
Residential District the Planning Commission may approve a greater area for
identification signs than specified in
Schedule 1145.04 if the Planning Commission during the conditional use approval
process determines that because of the size of the facility and the site the
proposed larger sign will be consistent with the objectives, intent and
criteria of these regulations.

1151.01 PURPOSE.
   The following regulations define the legal status of lots, uses of land,
structures, and uses of structures and land in combination which do not conform
to this Zoning Ordinance but which existed or were in operation prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance, or amendments thereto. The legitimate
interest of those who lawfully established these nonconformities are herein
recognized by providing for their continuance, subject to regulations limiting
their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution.
Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this Ordinance that such
nonconformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not be
encouraged to survive. Accordingly, the completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension or substitution of nonconformities shall be subject
to these regulations and shall be allowed upon review and approval by the
Planning Commission except as specifically provided for in the Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1151.02 COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION WITH EXISTING ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prohibit the completion of the
construction and use of nonconforming buildings for which a zoning certificate
has been issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or amendments
thereto, provided that construction is commenced within 90 days after the
issuance of the certificate, that construction is carried on diligently and
without interruption for a continuous period in excess of thirty days and that
the entire building is completed within one year after the issuance of the
zoning certificate.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1151.03 CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   A use of land, or building, or land and building in combination lawfully
existing on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or when any amendment
to this Zoning Ordinance becomes effective, may be continued and necessary
maintenance and repairs made although such use does not conform with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance provided the following conditions are met:
   (a)   Alterations. A building or structure containing a nonconforming use
may be altered, improved, or reconstructed, provided the work does not exceed
in aggregate cost the assessed value of the building or structure. Otherwise
the building or structure shall be changed to a conforming use.
   (b)   Change in Use. A nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use provided that the proposed nonconforming use is less in
conflict with the character and intent of the zoning district than the existing
nonconforming use as determined by the Planning Commission. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
   (c)   Displacement. No nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a
conforming use.
   (d)   Certificate of Nonconforming Use. The Planning Commission shall issue
a “Certificate of Nonconforming Use” within one year of the effective date of
the Zoning Ordinance, to all known owners of property, the use of which does
not conform to the provisions of the zoning district in which the property is
located.
      (1)   The provisions shall apply only to commercial and industrial use
for which no fee shall be charged.
      (2)   In accordance with the provision of this subsection, no use of
land, buildings, or structures shall be made other than that specified on the
“Certificate of Nonconforming Use” unless such use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the district in which the property is located.
      (3)   A copy of each “Certificate of Nonconforming Use” shall be filed in
the office of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1151.04 TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   The right to maintain and operate a nonconforming use shall terminate
immediately in the event one or more of the following occurs:
   (a)   Discontinuance and Abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has been
discontinued for a period of 6 months or more, the discontinuance shall be
considered conclusive evidence of an intention to abandon legally the
nonconforming use. At the end of the 6-month period, the nonconforming use
shall not be reestablished, and any further use shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Damage or Destruction. In the event that any building or structure
devoted to a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of more
than its assessed value, as determined for tax purposes by the county auditor,
it shall not be rebuilt, restored or reoccupied for any use unless it conforms
to all regulations of this Ordinance.
   (c)   Illegal Nonconforming Uses. Nonconforming uses existing on the
effective date of the Zoning Ordinance established without a zoning
certificate, or those nonconforming uses which cannot be proved conclusively as
existing prior to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance, shall be declared
illegal nonconforming uses and shall be discontinued within a period of two
years following the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1151.05 NONCONFORMING CONDITIONAL USE.
   Uses existing prior to the enactment of this Zoning Ordinance which are
listed as conditional uses in the district in which they are located shall be
considered as nonconforming uses if they do not fully comply with the
conditions for the conditionally permitted use set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (a)   All uses existing at the time of passage of the Zoning Ordinance which
are conditional uses in their respective districts under the Zoning Ordinance,
shall be issued Conditional Zoning Certificates within one year after the
passage of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   The certificates shall be issued by the Planning Commission and no
public hearing shall be required nor shall a fee be charged for such
certificate.
1151.06 CONTINUED USE OF NONCONFORMING LOT OR STRUCTURE.
   If, on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or future amendment,
there exists a lawful use of a zoning lot and/or building which, under the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance as adopted or so amended, is a permitted
principal use in the district in which it is located but which does not, under
the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as adopted or so amended, conform to the
regulations of this Zoning Ordinance with respect to lot width, lot area, off-
street parking, yards, height, lot coverage, or other regulations, standards or
requirements concerning such lot or structure, or such use thereof, such use of
land and/or structure may be continued, except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Zoning Ordinance, so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   Alterations. A nonconforming building or structure, including access
drives and parking areas, may be repaired, remodeled, reconstructed or
structurally altered provided no such nonconforming building or site condition,
except as provided in subsection (b), shall be structurally altered or extended
in a way which increases its nonconformity.
   (b)   Reconstruction and Restoration. Nothing in the Zoning Ordinance shall
prevent the reconstruction, repairing, rebuilding, and continued use of any
nonconforming building or structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, or
acts of God, subsequent to the date of this section wherein the expense of such
work does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the replacement cost of the
building or structure at the time such damage occurred.
   (c)   Change in Principal Use of Lot or Building. The use of such land and/
or building may be changed to any other permitted principal use in the district
in which it is located so long as the nonconformity is not increased and so
long as the new use complies with any special regulations, standards or
requirements specified by the Zoning Ordinance for such use.
   (d)   Change in Conditional Use. A conditional use of land and/or building
may be changed to another conditional use when approved pursuant to Section
1163.04 so long as any nonconformity is not increased. However, as a condition
of approval for a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission may require
that the level of nonconformity of a nonconforming building, structure or site
condition be reduced.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1151.07 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Any lot of record which is nonconforming in area, width, or depth at the
time of the original adoption of this Zoning Ordinance in 1995, and which does
not adjoin any land under the same ownership as said lot, may be used as a
building lot provided the yard requirements and minimum floor area meet the
following standards:

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
 
      (3)   Runoff control practices. The applicant must make use of measures
that control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion.
Such practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to
direct flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These
practices shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
      (4)   Sediment control practices. The applicant must install structural
practices that shall store runoff, allowing sediments to settle and/or divert
flows away from exposed soils or otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas.
Structural practices shall be used to control erosion ad trap sediment from a
site remaining disturbed for more than 13 days. Such practices may include,
among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet
protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to a
sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in
conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
         A.   Construction entrances. Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter and placed over a geotextile fabric.
         B.   Concrete truck wash out. The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
         C.   Street sweeping. Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
         D.   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed on storm water catch basins located
on the subject property and, if there is no threat to public safety, on curb
inlets closest to the construction entrance, to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets.
         E.   Silt fence and other perimeter controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the [community] shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in the construction
general permit.
      (5)   Non-sediment pollutant controls. No solid or liquid waste,
including building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The
applicant must implement site BMPs to prevent toxic materials, hazardous
materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
      (6)   Compliance with other requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable state and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      (7)   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      (8)   Internal inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected
by the applicant's agent at least once every seven days and within 24 hours
after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24-hour period.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
      (9)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the SSWCD. When inspections reveal the need
for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs,
the following procedures shall be followed:
         A.   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an inspection
reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         B.   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its intended
function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control
practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice
must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
         C.   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (10)   Final stabilization. Final stabilization is reached when 75% of
the disturbed area has been protected from erosion by vegetation, clean stone,
pavement, or other acceptable means.
   (b)   Post-construction water quality practices shall meet the requirements
of Chapter 1062, Comprehensive Stormwater Management of the City of Munroe
Falls Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2022-15. Passed 12-6-22.)
1152.11 FEES.
   A SWP3 and abbreviated SWP3 review, filing, and inspection fee is part of a
complete submittal. Fees are required to be submitted to the SSWCD before the
review process begins. Please consult with SSWCD for current fee schedule.
Applicants will be charged two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each

following compliance issues.
   (a)   Construction activities have started at the site with no SWP3
completed;
   (b)   Failure to install sediment basin(s) when the SWP3 and/or site
drainage clearly indicate as a first step (within seven days prior to grading
and within seven days of grubbing);
   (c)   Failure to implement any sediment/erosion controls; or
   (d)   Dewatering activities resulting in turbid discharges.
(Ord. 2022-15. Passed 12-6-22.)
1152.12 BOND.
   If a SWP3 or abbreviated SWP3 is required by this regulation, soil
disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond has been
deposited to the Building Department. The bond amount shall be a minimum of two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) and an additional one thousand five
hundred dollars ($1,500) paid for each subsequent acre or fraction thereof. The
bond will be used for the City of Munroe Falls to perform the obligations
otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as stated in
this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in the event
that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation. The
cash bond shall be returned, less City administrative fees as detail in
Chapter 163 of the City of Munroe Falls Codified Ordinances, after all work
required by this regulation has been completed and final stabilization has been
reached, all as determined by SSWCD.
   (a)   A portion of bond (equivalent of cost to apply final stabilization)
will be retained until all areas disturbed by construction activity are
permanently stabilized and a notice of termination (NOT) has been submitted to
Ohio EPA. Where vegetative growth is used to achieve permanent stabilization,
the area shall comply with final stabilization requirements of the construction
general permit.

1162.01   PUBLIC PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Munroe Falls.
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Munroe Falls to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City's future expenses
related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1162.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Summit County, and the
City of Munroe Falls shall comply with this regulation for linear projects
within public rights-of-way (e.g., roadway and sidewalk projects).
   (e)   This regulation does not require a comprehensive stormwater management
plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the authorized enforcement agent, City Engineer, and/or Ohio EPA.
Such projects must be designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and
the width of disturbance. Linear construction projects must comply with the
requirements of
Chapter 1152, Erosion and Sediment Control.

(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.09   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General. The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; to meet the requirements of the
construction general permit; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated SCMs that address degradation of water resources. The
SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the water resources receiving stormwater
discharges from the site. Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Section
1142.06.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable. Where feasible, bioretention, permeable
pavement with infiltration, underground storage with infiltration, infiltration
trenches, infiltration basins, and/or rainwater harvesting must be the water
quality SCMs used. Separate SCMs may be used for peak discharge control and
water quality treatment.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City of Munroe Falls and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use. SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots. Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter 1181, shall provide stormwater management
and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided lots. This
shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the extent
practicable, the predevelopment runoff patterns, volumes, and peaks from each
lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources. SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1162.07  of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1152  and
Chapter 1142 , all as determined by the City Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of two foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption. The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1162.09  if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by SCMs defined in
a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the City Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance. All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
inspection and maintenance plan and agreements approved by the City Engineer.
      (8)   Ownership. Unless otherwise required by the City of Munroe Falls,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the City. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of existing natural drainage. Practices that preserve
the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.
Such practices may include minimizing site grading and compaction; protecting
and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing vegetation and
vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in order to
minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation of tree
preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices; and
maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
      (10)   Post-construction soil restoration. Except for areas that will be
covered by impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil
moisture-holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be
restored to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent
practicable. Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer
removed should be amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria in
Rainwater and Land Development.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria. All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection. The City Engineer may allow modification
to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only if the
applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio
EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1162.07  of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with
Chapter 1152  and
Chapter 1142 , all as determined by the City Engineer. At a minimum, stream
relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the
vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges. Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities, or the stormwater
quality control facility shall be sized to treat the off-site flow.
Comprehensive stormwater management plans will not be approved until it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that off-site runoff will
be adequately conveyed through the development site in a manner that does not
exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. The sheet flow
length shall not exceed 75-feet from impervious area or 150-feet from pervious
areas. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs
from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined
by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels. Unless otherwise allowed by the City Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10-year, 24-hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems. Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under City zoning or where the use of an open drainage system affects
public health or safety, all as determined by the City Engineer. The following
criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5-year, 24-hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10-year, 24-hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12-inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water resource crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Munroe Falls:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow based on the Summit County Drainage Manual (current
edition), ODOT Location and Design Manual (Volume 2, Sections 1000 and 1100),
or the minimum 25-year, 24-hour storm, the most restrictive shall prevail.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all state scenic rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark (OHW or OHWM).
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, 25% of the
cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1-foot of box culverts and pipe arches
must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or conveyance must be sized
to meet the Summit County Drainage Manual (current edition), ODOT Location and
Design Manual (Volume 2, Sections 1000 and 1100), or to carry the 25-year storm
under these conditions, the most restrictive shall prevail.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12-inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5-square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
24-hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding. Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least two feet below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation. In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the City of Munroe Falls
must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the City, reductions in volume due to
floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the
development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control. The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCMs that meet or exceed the criteria in the construction
general permit.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control. The comprehensive stormwater management
plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
critical storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and
100-year storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this
requirement.
      (3)   The critical storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City Engineer, the total volume (acre-feet)
of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development drainage
area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the following
standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, and time
of concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Use the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States,
NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [online: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/] for
rainfall depth data for stormwater design.
            6.   Use the SCS Type II rainfall distribution for all design
events with a recurrence interval greater than one year. Include lot coverage
assumptions used for full build out of the proposed condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten years and not only the current
land use.
               a.   Pre-development curve numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               b.   Post-development curve numbers - Open space areas shall use
post-construction hydrologic soil groups from Rainwater and Land Development
unless the soil is amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development. All undisturbed areas or open space with
amended soils shall be treated as "open space in good condition".
            8.   Time of concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               a.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100-feet.
               b.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by runoff reduction SCMs may be
subtracted from the post-development stormwater volume. Volume reductions for
these SCMs may be demonstrated using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land
Development or a hydrologic model acceptable to the City Engineer.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems. From the volume determined in division (d)(3)A.1. of this
section, determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to development.
Using the percentage, select the 24-hour critical storm from Table 3.
   Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
---                       10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the critical storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas. SCMs on
previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the construction general
permit.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   When the City of Munroe Falls determines that site constraints compromise
the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in
an improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the construction general permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. The City
Engineer may require proof of Ohio EPA review and approval for any alternative
action proposed. Alternative actions may include but are not limited to the
following.
   (a)   Fees, in an amount specified by the City to be applied to community-
wide SCMs.
   (b)   Implementation of offsite SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing SCM
to increase quality and quantity control.
   (c)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
   (d)   Acquisition or conservation easements placed on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the City Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the inspection and maintenance
agreement submitted with the comprehensive stormwater management plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the City of Munroe Falls prior to
approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Summit County Auditor
and on all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the City Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an additional 25-foot-
wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the inspection and maintenance agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to SCMs shall be restricted against the construction therein
of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may obstruct the free
flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and maintenance equipment; and
against the changing of final grade from that described by the final grading
plan approved by the City of Munroe Falls. Any re-grading and/or obstruction
placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the City at the property
owners' expense.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.12 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the City Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the final
grade at the site, after all the utilities are installed, and the site is
subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the City Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these SCMs, all disturbed areas
and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must be
stabilized within two days.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.13 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the applicant and provided to the
City Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the City Engineer and per the
approved comprehensive stormwater management plan.
   (b)   An as-built certification, including as-built survey and inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a professional engineer and a professional
surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the comprehensive stormwater management plan approved
by the City Engineer. In evaluating this certification, the City Engineer may
require the submission of a new set of SCM calculations if they determine that
the design was altered significantly from the approved comprehensive stormwater
management plan. The as-built survey must provide the location, dimensions, and
bearing of such SCMs and include the entity responsible for long-term
maintenance as detailed in the inspection and maintenance agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded inspection and maintenance plan
and inspection and maintenance agreement as specified in Section
1162.08 must be provided to the City Engineer.
   (d)   A post-construction transition meeting must be held with the City,
property owner, project engineer, and staff in charge of the maintenance of the
SCMs to discuss design, construction, long-term operation and maintenance and
annual inspections/reports for the community after the SCM is constructed and
before a notice of termination (NOT) is submitted.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.14 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP.
   (a)   Upon a change of ownership of a regulated development, each new owner
of the regulated development or any part thereof shall comply with the plan
approved for that regulated development until such time as the building
commissioner approves an amendment or other modification of the plan for that
development.
   (b)   A change of ownership of a regulated development shall not be
considered to be an amendment. However, the owner of a regulated development
for which a plan is required or has been approved shall notify each new owner
of the applicability of the plan to the regulated development, and provide each
new owner with a copy of the plan, before consummation of the sale of the
development. A violation of this division (b) shall be punishable by a fine of
five hundred dollars ($500.00).
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.15 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the inspection
and maintenance plan and inspection and maintenance agreement. The City of
Munroe Falls has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
inspections as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to
verify that the SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this
regulation.
   (b)   The City shall maintain public records of the results of site
inspections, shall inform the landowner(s), organization, or public entity
responsible for maintenance of the inspection results, and shall specifically
indicate in writing any corrective actions required to bring the SCMs into
proper working condition.
   (c)   Upon notification, the responsible party shall have ten working days,
or other mutually agreed upon time, to make repairs or submit a plan with
detailed action items and established timelines. Should repairs not be made
within this time, or a plan approved by the City Engineer for these repairs not
in place, the City may undertake the necessary repairs and assess the
responsible party.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.16 FEES.
   The comprehensive stormwater management plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the City
of Munroe Falls before the review process begins. The City Engineer shall
establish a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing
these services.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)
1162.17 BOND.
   (a)   If a comprehensive stormwater management plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 10% of the total project cost has been deposited with the City of Munroe
Falls Finance Department. This bond shall be posted for the City to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the applicant fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less City administrative fees
as detailed in
Chapter 163 of the City of Munroe Falls Codified Ordinances, when the following
three criteria are met
      (1)   The site has been stabilized, temporary BMPs have been removed, and
the sediment settling basin has been converted to or replaced with post-
construction SCM(s) and one of the following conditions are met:
         A.   100% of the total project has achieved permanent stabilization.
         B.   Less than one acre of lots remain unbuilt.
         C.   No development activities have occurred for one year.
      (2)   An as-built certification of all SCMs is approved by the City
Engineer.
      (3)   An inspection and maintenance plan has been approved by the City of
Munroe Falls and inspection and maintenance agreement has been signed by the
developer, the contractor, the City, and the private owner or homeowners'
association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted
by the City Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the City of Munroe Falls may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues
with all stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the
bond shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for the
purpose of long-term maintenance of the project.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 12-6-22.)

1163.01 PURPOSE.
   In order to accomplish the purposes for which this Zoning Ordinance is
adopted, it is essential that its regulations be soundly and consistently
applied, and that this Zoning Ordinance be vigorously administered. This
Chapter stipulates the procedures to be followed in obtaining zoning
certificates, including conditional zoning certificates.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1163.02 ZONING CERTIFICATES.
   (a)   Zoning Certificate Required. No building or other structure, except as
provided for in this Zoning Ordinance, shall be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, enlarged, moved or structurally altered, nor shall any
excavation or site improvements be commenced, until a zoning certificate has
been applied for and received by the owner of the property involved or a person
having an interest in such property and acting under written authority of the
owner, and such certificate has been issued by the Zoning Inspector. A zoning
certificate shall be issued only when:

      (3)   A conditional use has been approved by Council based upon a
recommendation by Planning Commission according to the procedures set forth in
Section
1163.04. Approval by Council shall authorize the Zoning Inspector to issue a
conditional zoning certificate in compliance with said approval. Such
conditional zoning certificate shall set forth any conditions, stipulations,
and safeguards that have been approved by Planning Commission and Council.
      (4)   A request for a variance from a numerical standard of the Zoning
Ordinance has been approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with
the limitations, procedures and requirements of Section
1165.03.
   (b)   Submission of Applications for Zoning Certificates. Application forms
for zoning certificates shall be available in the office of the Zoning
Inspector. A completed application accompanied by payment of the required fee
and all other applicable submission requirements established in this chapter
shall be submitted to the Zoning Inspector.
      (1)   An application for uses not requiring site plan review shall
include:
         A.   A plot plan drawn to scale showing the exact dimensions of the
lot to be built upon.
         B.   The location, dimensions, height and bulk of structures to be
erected.
         C.   The intended use.
         D.   The proposed number of dwelling units.
         E.   The yard, open area and parking space dimensions.

requirements established in Section
1163.03.
   (c)   Review for Completeness by Zoning Inspector. Upon receipt of an
application, the Zoning Inspector shall within a reasonable period review the
application and any accompanied proposed plan for completeness with all the
applicable submission requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Action by Zoning Inspector.
      (1)   Applications Not Requiring Site Plan Review: For applications not
requiring site plan review, the Zoning Inspector shall, within 30 days after
determining an application complete, issue a zoning certificate if the
application complies with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and the
application is accompanied by the proper fee.
      (2)   Transmittal to Planning Commission for Site Plan Review: An
application for a zoning certificate for a use requiring site plan review shall
be transmitted to the Planning Commission to begin the review process
established in Section
1163.03.
   (e)   Expiration of Zoning Certificates. A zoning certificate shall become
void at the expiration of one year after the date of issuance unless
construction is begun. If no construction is begun or use changed within one
year of the date of the certificate, a new application and certificate shall be
required. Construction is deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation
and piers or footings of one or more principal building(s) included in the plan
shall have been completed.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1163.03 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   The purpose of this section is to provide adequate review by the Planning
Commission and Council of proposed developments in those zoning districts where
the uses permitted are of such a nature, because of their size, scale or effect
on surrounding property, that review of specific plans is deemed necessary to
protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community.
   (a)   Site Plan Review Required. Site plan review shall be required for the
following:
      (1)   New construction of all permitted uses in commercial and industrial
districts;
      (2)   All conditional uses in all districts, including multi-family uses;
and
      (3)   Any existing or previously approved development meeting the
criteria of (1) and (2) above which proposes to alter, reconstruct or otherwise
modify a use or site including expanding the floor area of the permitted use,
increasing the number of dwelling units in a multi-family development, or
changing the use which requires an increase in the amount of parking or a
change in the site's circulation.
   (b)   Preliminary Plans. The developer or owner of any proposed development,
use or structure requiring site plan review pursuant to subsection (a) is
encouraged to meet informally with the Planning Commission to review
preliminary plans prior to preparing final plans pursuant to subsection (c)
below. The purpose of such preliminary review is to establish a mutual
understanding of the provisions of this Ordinance and the development
objectives of the City. Preliminary plans should be submitted to the Zoning
Inspector 10 days prior to the next Planning Commission meeting in order for
discussion of the preliminary plans to be scheduled on the agenda for the next
Planning Commission meeting.
   (c)   Final Development Plan. The applicant for a zoning certificate or
conditional use certificate for any use requiring site plan approval shall
submit the final development plan to the Zoning Inspector along with payment of
the required fee. The final development plan shall be prepared by a qualified
professional and drawn to an appropriate scale and shall disclose all uses
proposed for the development, their location, extent and characteristics and
shall include, unless parts are not applicable or necessary and are waived by
the Zoning Inspector for certain types of projects, the following maps, plans,
designs and supplementary documents:
      (1)   An accurate legal description prepared by or certified by a
registered surveyor of the state;

parking and drives within 200 feet of the site;
         D.   Proposed and existing fences, walls, signs, lighting;
         E.   Location and layout of all outdoor storage areas including
storage of waste materials and location of trash receptacles;
         F.   Sanitary sewers, water and other utilities including fire
hydrants, as required, and proposed drainage and storm water management;
         G.   Dimensions of all buildings, setbacks, parking lots, drives and
walkways.
      (4)   Topographic maps with sufficient elevations to show existing and
generally proposed grading contours, and major vegetation features, including
existing trees over three inches in diameter and wooded areas;
      (5)   Proposed landscaping and screening plans indicating the preliminary
description of the location and nature of existing and proposed vegetation,
landscaping and screening elements and the existing trees to be removed;
      (6)   Preliminary architectural sketches of buildings and other
structures, floor plans, site construction materials and signs;
      (7)   Summary table showing total acres of the proposed development;
number of acres devoted to each type of residential and/or non-residential use
including streets and open space; number of dwelling units by type;
      (8)   Other features necessary for the evaluation of the development plan
as deemed necessary by the Zoning Inspector or Planning Commission.
   (d)   Review for Completeness. The Zoning Inspector shall review the
application for completeness with the submission requirements prior to the
application being placed on the agenda of the Planning Commission.
   (e)   Planning Commission Review of Site Plans. The application shall be
transmitted to the Planning Commission, at which time the Planning Commission
may then distribute the application to appropriate administrative departments
and professional consultants for review and comment. Any reports, comments or
expert opinions should be available to the Planning Commission at the time of
the Commission's review.
   (f)   Review Criteria. In reviewing a final plan the Planning Commission
shall consider the location of buildings, parking areas and other features with
respect to the topography of the lot and existing natural features such as
streams and large trees; the efficiency, adequacy and safety of the proposed
layout of internal streets and driveways; the location of the green area
provided, bearing in mind the possible effects of irregularly shaped lots; the
adequacy of location, landscaping and screening of the parking lots; and such
other matters as the Commission may find to have a material bearing upon the
stated standards and objectives of the various district regulations. In
approving a site plan, the Planning Commission shall find that:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with any plan for the orderly development of
the City.
      (2)   The appropriate use and value of property within and adjacent to
the area will be safeguarded.
      (3)   The development will result in a harmonious grouping of buildings
within the proposed development and in relationship to existing and proposed
uses on adjacent property.
      (4)   The development will have adequate public service, parking and open
spaces.
      (5)   The plan, to the extent practical, will preserve and be sensitive
to the natural characteristics of the site.
      (6)   Adequate provision is made for safe and efficient pedestrian and
vehicular circulation within the site and to adjacent property.
      (7)   Adequate provision is made for storm drainage within and through
the site so as to maintain, as far as practicable, usual and normal swales,
water courses and drainage areas, and shall comply with any applicable
regulations or design criteria established by the City or any other
governmental entity which may have jurisdiction over such matters.
      (8)   If the project is to be carried out in progressive stages, each
stage shall be so planned that the foregoing conditions are complied with at
the completion of each stage.
         If the Planning Commission finds that the proposed development
substantially complies with all specific requirements and with the purposes,
intent and basic objectives of the zoning district and that through imaginative
and skillful design in the arrangement of buildings, open space, streets,
access drives and other features, as disclosed by the application, the proposal
results in a development of equivalent or higher quality than that which could
be achieved through strict application of such standards and requirements and
that the development, as proposed, shall have no adverse impact upon the
surrounding properties or upon the health, safety or general welfare of the
community, the Commission may act upon the application as if it is in
compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
   (g)   Action by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall submit to
Council one of the following recommendations: approval of the site plan as
submitted; approval of the site plan subject to specific conditions not
included in the plan as submitted, such as, but not limited to, improvements to
the yard layout, open space arrangement, on-site control of access to streets
or such features as fences, walls and plantings to further protect and improve
the proposed and surrounding developments; or denial of the site plan. If the
Commission finds that a proposed plan does not meet the purposes of these
regulations, it shall recommend that Council deny the plan and the Commission
shall submit its findings in writing, together with the reasons therefore, to
the applicant, upon the applicant's request.
   (h)   Action by Council. The plan and Planning Commission’s recommendation
shall be submitted to Council for action. If Council fails to act by the next
scheduled meeting following 120 days from when the application was determined
complete, or an extended period of time as may be agreed upon, the applicant
may assume that the application has been denied.
      In its review of the site plan, Council shall consider and weigh the same
factors and criteria as established for Planning Commission review.
      Upon approval of the final development plan by Council, the Zoning
Inspector shall issue a zoning certificate.
   (i)   Significance of an Approved Plan; Plan Revisions. An approved site
plan shall become for the proposed development a binding commitment of the
specific elements approved for development. The approved site plan may be
transferred to another person, corporation, or group of individuals or
corporations prior to the issuance of a building permit. Such a transfer shall
occur only upon approval of City Council. A request for such a transfer or
change of ownership shall be presented to City Council and granted only if the
new ownership entity satisfies the administrative, financial, legal and all
other performance guarantees approved with the original site plan. All
construction and development under any building permit shall be in accordance
with the approved plan. Any departure from such plan shall be cause for
revocation of the zoning certificate. Any changes in an approved plan shall be
resubmitted for approval in accordance with this Section.
   (j)   Lapse of Approval. An approved plan shall remain valid for a period of
12 months following the date of its approval or for a period so specified by
Council. If at the end of that time construction has not begun, then such plan
shall be considered as having lapsed and shall be of no effect unless
resubmitted and reapproved by the Planning Commission and confirmed by Council.
Construction is deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and piers or
footings of one or more principal buildings included in the plan shall have
been completed.
(Ord. 28-01. Passed 9-18-01.)
1163.04 CONDITIONAL ZONING CERTIFICATES.
   When a proposed use is permitted in a zoning district as a conditional use
as set forth in the district regulations, a conditional zoning certificate is
required and the application for such conditional zoning certificate shall be
submitted and reviewed according to the following:
   (a)   Submission of Application. The owner, or agent thereof, of property
for which such conditional use is proposed shall file with the Zoning Inspector
an application for a conditional zoning certificate accompanied by payment of
the required fee established by Council. The application for a conditional
zoning certificate shall disclose all uses proposed for the development, their
location, extent and characteristics and shall include, unless parts are not
applicable or necessary and are waived by the Zoning Inspector for certain
types of projects, a site plan and associated documentation as required in
Section
1163.03(a).
   (b)   Review for Completeness. The Zoning Inspector shall review the
application for completeness with the submission requirements prior to the
application being placed on the agenda of the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review of Conditional Uses. The application shall
be transmitted to the Planning Commission, at which time the Planning
Commission may then distribute the application to appropriate administrative
departments for review and comment. Administrative review should be completed
and any reports or comments submitted to the Planning Commission prior to the
time of the Commission's review.
   (d)   Public Hearing and Notice by Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application. Notice of such
public hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation
in the City at least 10 days before the date of said public hearing. All
notices shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the nature
of the proposed conditional use.
   (e)   Review Criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the proposed
conditional use, as presented on the submitted plans and specifications, to
determine whether or not the proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with
the purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance. In making such a
determination, the Planning Commission shall find that both the general
criteria established for all conditional uses and the specific requirements
established for that particular use, as set forth in
Chapter 1141, shall be satisfied by the establishment and operation of the
proposed use.
         In addition, the Planning Commission shall review the site plan for
the proposed conditional use according to the site plan review criteria set
forth in Section
1163.03(f).
         The Commission may require such additional information as deemed
necessary including the carrying out of special studies and the provisions of
expert advice.
   (f)   Action by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall take one
of the following actions:
      (1)   If the proposed conditional use is found to be appropriate, the
Planning Commission shall recommend that Council, by resolution, approve a
conditional zoning certificate. As part of the recommendation, the Planning
Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions, stipulations, safeguards and
limitations on the duration of the use as it may deem necessary and in
conformance with the intent and purposes of this Ordinance for the protection
of nearby property and the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
community.
      (2)   If the proposed use is found to be not in compliance with the
specifications of this Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall
recommend the denial of the conditional zoning certificate.
         With the concurrence of the applicant, the Planning Commission may
take such additional time as may be necessary to further study the proposal and
consider modifications thereto. These considerations may include the
applicant's further preparation or modification of plans and specifications and
any studies or expert advice sought by the Planning Commission to assist in
their evaluation. Studies and expert advice may be provided by appropriate city
officials, or by other recognized and duly certified experts. The cost of
securing expert advice and studies, including the use of city officials' time
in excess of that normally provided under these regulations, shall be borne by
the applicant, who shall pay said costs prior to the issuance of the
conditional zoning certificate.
   (g)   Council Review. Following action by the Planning Commission, the
application for the conditional zoning certificate, along with the Planning
Commission's recommendation, shall be submitted to Council for consideration.
In its review of the conditional use application and recommendation of the
Planning Commission, Council shall consider and weigh the same factors and
criteria as established for Planning Commission review.
   (h)   Action by Council. Council, by majority vote, may enact a resolution
granting a conditional zoning certificate recommended by the Planning
Commission. A conditional zoning certificate which violates, differs from or
departs in substantive form from the recommendation of the Commission shall not
take effect unless approved by five members of Council. If Council fails to act
within 120 days from when the application was determined complete, or an
extended period of time as may be agreed upon, the applicant may assume that
the application has been denied.
   (i)   Supplementary Conditions. Council may impose such additional
conditions and safeguards as deemed necessary for the general welfare, for the
protection of individual property rights and for ensuring that the intent and
objectives of this Zoning Ordinance are observed.
   (j)   Terms and Duration of Conditional Zoning Certificate. A conditional
zoning certificate shall be deemed to authorize a particular conditional use on
a specific parcel for which it was approved. The conditional zoning certificate
is nonassignable and shall expire one year from the date of enactment, unless
substantial progress is accomplished or as otherwise specifically approved by
Planning Commission and Council. The breach of any condition, safeguard or
requirement shall automatically invalidate the conditional zoning certificate
granted, and shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance. Such
violation shall be punishable as per Section
1167.04.
   (k)   Reapplication. An application for a conditional zoning certificate
which has been previously denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission
or Council shall not be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for a period of
90 days after the denial by Planning Commission or Council, whichever is later,
and said reapplication shall comply with all of the requirements of this
section including the payment of the required fee.
   (l)   Time Limitations for Conditional Use Permits. A conditional use permit
issued for new construction shall require substantial progress to have begun on
the construction within one year of the issuance of the permit, unless
otherwise specifically designated by Planning Commission and City Council.

Ch. 1169
1165.01 GENERAL.
   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements of
this Chapter. As specified in Section
1161.04, the Board of Zoning Appeals has appellate jurisdiction relative to
appeals and variances.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1165.02 APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm or
corporation, or by any officer, board or department of the Municipality,
deeming himself or itself to be adversely affected by the decision of the
Zoning Inspector.
   (a)   Initiation of Appeal. Notice of appeal shall be filed with the
secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals within 30 calendar days after the date
of any adverse order, requirement, decision, or determination, except when the
30th day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, then the 30th day shall be
deemed to be the next day of business thereafter. Such written notice of appeal
shall specify therein the grounds and reasons for the appeal. Upon the filing
of any such appeal, the secretary shall forthwith notify the Zoning Inspector
of the action so appealed. Within 24 hours the Zoning Inspector shall transmit
to the secretary all data pertaining to the subject matter upon which the
action so appealed was taken.
   (b)   Public Hearing by the Board. When a notice of appeal has been filed in
proper form with the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Clerk of Council shall
immediately place the request upon the calendar for hearing, and shall cause
notices stating the time, place, and object of the hearing to be served
personally or by mail, addressed to the parties making the request for appeal,
variances, or exception at least five days prior to the date of the scheduled
hearing. All notices shall be sent to addresses given in the application;
otherwise to the addresses given in the last assessment roll. Not less than 14
days prior to the date set for such hearing or appeal, written notice of such
hearing shall be caused by the Board to be given by mail to any person, firm,
or corporation owning premises located within 200 feet of the land to which
such appeal or application relates. The Board may recess such hearings from
time to time, and, if the time and place of the continued hearing be publicly
announced at the time of adjournment, no further notice shall be required. Any
person in interest may appear at the public hearing in person or by attorney.
The appellant, except the Municipality, shall post security for the cost of all
action required for the hearing of the appeal.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Inspector shall
certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of the appeal has been
filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed by other than a restraining order granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals
or by a court having lawful jurisdiction.
   (d)   Decision of the Board. Within its powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify to be done, and to that end
shall have all the powers of the officers from whom the appeal is taken, and it
may direct the issuance of a certificate. The Board shall render a decision on
the appeal without unreasonable delay. If the Board fails to act within 90 days
from the date the appeal was received by the Board, or an extended period of
time as may be agreed upon, the appellant may assume the appeal has been
denied.
   (e)   Notification of Board's Decision. The secretary of the Board shall
notify the appellant in writing of the decision of the Board. The Board shall
keep minutes of all proceedings upon appeal, showing the vote of each member
thereon, and shall keep records of its official actions.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1165.03 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest according to the following procedures:
   (a)   Application Requirements. An application for a variance shall be filed
with the Zoning Inspector for review by the Board of Zoning Appeals upon the
forms provided, and shall be accompanied by the following requirements
necessary to convey the reason(s) for the requested variance:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant(s);
      (2)   Proof of ownership, legal interest or written authority;
      (3)   Description of property or portion thereof;
      (4)   Description or nature of variance requested;
      (5)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating the
justification for the variance pursuant to subsection (b) below;
      (6)   Site plans, floor plans, elevations and other drawings at a
reasonable scale to convey the need for the variance;
      (7)   Payment of the application fee as established by Council;
      (8)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Zoning Inspector.
         Upon receipt of a written request for variance, the Zoning Inspector
shall within a reasonable amount of time make a preliminary review of the
request to determine whether such application provides the information
necessary for review and evaluation. If it is determined that such application
does not provide the information necessary for such review and evaluation, the
Zoning Inspector shall so advise the applicant of the deficiencies and shall
not further process the application until the deficiency is corrected.
   (b)   Review by the Board. According to the procedures established for
appeals in Section
1165.02(b), the Board shall hold a public hearing and give notice of the same.
The Board shall review each application for a variance to determine if it
complies with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance and evidence
demonstrates that a variance from the literal enforcement of this Zoning
Ordinance will afford justice and avoid unnecessary hardship. The following
factors shall be considered and weighed by the Board:
      (1)   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
      (2)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary to
make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
      (6)   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
      (7)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
      (8)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
      (9)   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
         The Board of Zoning Appeals has no authority to authorize a change in
the use of any parcel of land.
   (c)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Board may further prescribe
any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to ensure that the
objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies will
be met.
   (d)   Action by the Board. The Board shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (c), or disapprove the
request for variance. The Board shall further make a finding in writing that
the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance
that will make possible a reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
   (e)   Term and Extension of Variance. Variances shall be nonassignable and
shall expire one year from the date of their enactment, unless prior thereto,
the applicant commences actual construction in accordance with the granted
variance. There shall be no modification of variances except by further
consideration of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Requests for renewal of expired
variances shall be considered to be the same as an application for a variance
and shall meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to this
section.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
   (f)   An application for a zoning variance which has been previously
disapproved and/or approved with supplemental conditions attached by the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall not be resubmitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals for
the duration of the period of 90 days after the disapproval or approval with
supplementary conditions, and said reapplication shall comply with all of the
requirements of this section including the payment of the required fee.

1175.07 ABATEMENT BY CITY.
   (a)    Should a public nuisance not be abated within the time stated in the
notice given pursuant to this chapter, or within such additional time as the
Board may grant for such abatement, the Director of Public Service or his

abatement, he may cause the same to be sold at public or private sale at the
best price obtainable and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such
proceeds shall be deposited in the General Fund of the City. Should the amount
recovered be insufficient to pay the cost of the abatement, the remaining
balance shall become the assessment amount and notice of such assessment shall
be sent by regular mail to the owner or person having control of the real
estate at his last known address to pay the cost of such abatement. If payment
of such costs is not received by the City within thirty (30) days after the
mailing of such notice, then the amount shall be certified to the County
Auditor for collection of the same as other real estate taxes and assessments
are collected.
   (b)   The cost of abatement of the public nuisance shall be an amount
determined by the Director of Public Service and includes, without limitation,
the cost of preparing and sending any notices, the cost of inspection of
properties by City officials, and the cost of abating the public nuisance
whether such abatement is performed by the City or by an independent
contractor. Costs for services of City employees include, without limitation,
an amount based on the hourly rate of pay, including all fringe benefits, of
the personnel involved.
   (c)    The Director of Public Service may utilize any labor or equipment of
City in abating a public nuisance or may contract for the abatement thereof
provided that the expenditure of funds for such abatement is properly
authorized.

   (d)   Title block, scale, north point and date.
   (e)   The scale of the plat shall be not smaller than 1"=100 feet.
   (f)   Elevations by contour lines, the interval of which shall be two feet
and related to mean sea level.
   (g)   Precise bench marks.
   (h)   Water courses, property lines and fixed objects that may influence the
design of the street and utility layout.
   (i)   A Vicinity Plat showing the proposed subdivision superimposed over it
to show the arrangement and location of existing streets and public grounds
adjacent to the proposed subdivision. The Vicinity Plat may be a Municipal map.
   (j)   Location of all existing utilities in adjacent streets.
   (k)   Proposed street names.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1181.02 DESIGN CRITERIA.
   To establish a common basis for the design and layout of subdivisions and
allotments, the following criteria shall be observed in laying out the plat:
   (a)   Reserve Strips. No plat or map of a proposed street or allotment
showing reserve strips controlling access to public ways or showing strips of
land which will not prove taxable for special improvements will be approved,
provided that such reserve strips may be shown when the control and disposal of
land comprising such strips are definitely placed with the Municipality under
conditions meeting the approval of the Municipal Engineer, the Law Director and
the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Street Location and Widths. The location and widths of proposed
streets shall be such as to fit in with any plan of street development
recommended by the Planning Commission or other public authority. Due regard
shall be given to existing streets or streets capable of being established in
surrounding property, so that streets may be laid out through adjacent or
neighboring allotments with reasonable continuity of location and width.
      No street shall be less than fifty feet in width, provided that no street
shall be less than sixty feet in width where surface drainage is provided by
ditches. The Planning Commission may require greater width when in its opinion
the greater width is justified or needed.
   (c)   Length of Block and Street Arrangement. Where practical, intersecting
streets shall be provided so that no block shall be longer than 1200 feet.
Proposed streets shall follow the contour of the land wherever practical and
shall intersect one another at right angles or on radial lines as topography
and other limiting factors of good design permit.
   (d)   Dead-End Streets. No so-called dead-end streets will be approved for
dedication, except where conditions make the extension of such street
impractical. In such cases, a dead-end street may be approved, provided that
adequate turning space for vehicles is placed at the dead-end. Turning spaces
shall be of sufficient size to provide for a paved circular roadway at least
twenty feet in width, the inside radius of which shall be at least thirty-five
feet.
   (e)   Coterminal Streets. In order that proposed streets may be as nearly
coterminal as possible with existing streets in adjoining allotments, due
provision shall be made for the continuation of all existing streets which
extend to the boundaries of the proposed allotment.
   (f)   Lots. Lots in the subdivision shall abut on a street and double
frontage lots shall be avoided.
   (g)   Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
or radial to the right-of-way line of the street on which the lot faces.
   (h)   Corner Lots. Corner lot frontages shall be platted wider than interior
lots to allow for proper setback on both streets.
   (i)   Intersections. At street intersection property line corners shall be
rounded by an arc, the minimum radius of which shall be ten feet.
   (j)   Minimum Radii. Minimum radii shall be increased within the Commission
considers an increase necessary.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1181.03 PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL.
   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission and Council
shall be effective for a period of six months from the date of approval of the
preliminary plat by Council. If the final plat has not been submitted to the
Planning Commission within this time, the preliminary plat shall again be
submitted to the Planning Commission and Council for approval.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1181.04 FINAL PLAT REQUIREMENTS.
   Upon approval by the Planning Commission and Council of the preliminary plat
the final plat shall then be prepared and submitted. The final plat shall
contain the following features, information and addenda:
   (a)   The final plat shall show all lots and streets by accurate dimensions
and angles and shall be drawn in ink upon a good quality tracing cloth on
sheets 18" x 24". It shall be drawn to either the scale of one inch equals one
hundred feet or one inch equals fifty feet. All dimensions shall be shown in
feet and decimals of a foot. The Plat shall be completed and consistent in
itself as to all measurements. The streets shown on the plat shall be those as
determined by the preliminary plat and shall not duplicate any existing street
name. The plat, after recording, shall become the property of the Planning
Commission.
   (b)   The final plat shall have the following printed in suitable place

lot lines, reserved strips, and such other information as may be required.
   (d)   The final plat shall show all existing monument and markets and their
relationship to the proposed allotment and shall show the location of all
monuments set by the developer's surveyor. Monuments used shall be forty-two
inches in length and one and one-fourth inches in diameter. Provided that in
case it is impossible to drive or place monuments of such length, the shorter
monuments may be set in concrete cylinders at least six inches in diameter and
at least thirty inches in depth. In case monuments are made one and one-fourth
inches pipe, such monuments shall have a poured lead center held in place by at
least two pins place through the lead centers at right angles to each other.
   (e)   Title Insurance in an amount sufficient to insure the Municipality as

public land in the name of the Municipality at the time of the filing of the
final plat for record with the Summit County Recorder.
   (f)   The final plat shall include a plan providing for the underground
installation of all utilities within the subdivision or reallotment. In all new
allotments or reallotments all utility lines shall be installed underground.
All owners or petitioners for subdivisions of land or reallotments shall grant
easements for such lines and areas as are needed by utilities for installation
of their lines and needed equipment including street lighting.
      Statements from the utility companies shall be provided indicating that
the owner or petitioner has granted to the utilities, in form satisfactory to
the utilities, all easements necessary for the installation, operation and
maintenance of service, including street lighting, in the allotment.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1181.05 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   Before approval will be given to any plat dedicating streets to public use,
the streets shall have been graded to a grade and cross section approved by the
Engineer, and in accordance with plans prepared by a registered Professional
Engineer, and approved by the Engineer. Upon approval of the plat, such grades
shall become the legal and established grades for such streets. In addition to
the grading, the following improvements must also be installed depending on the
availability of the facilities therefore, at the expense of the developer:
   (a)   Water Supply and Sewage Outlet. Evidence must be furnished, subject to
the satisfaction and approval of the Engineer, that adequate water supply means
and sewage outlet means meeting with the approval of the Summit County General
Health District and in conformity with ordinances and resolutions of the
Municipality are provided for each of the lots of the subdivision.
   (b)   Storm Sewers. Storm sewers adequate for the drainage of the streets,
the lots fronting thereon and the natural drainage intercepted by such street
must be installed in accordance with standards acceptable to the Engineer.
   (c)   Water Mains, Fire Hydrants. Where water main facilities are available
to the subdivision, water mains and fire hydrants meeting the approval of the
Village Engineer and the standards of the Director of Utilities together with
curb connections for each lot in such subdivision must be installed.
   (d)   Sanitary Sewers. Where sanitary sewer facilities are available to the
subdivision, sanitary sewers and laterals to each lot must also be installed.
   (e)   Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks shall be built in the street adjacent to
the property line in all new allotments. Such walks shall conform to standards
approved by the Engineer.
   (f)   Minimum Paving Requirements Where Water and/or Sanitary Sewers Not
Available. Where either water main facilities or sanitary sewer facilities or
both of them are not available, the street shall be graded to the full width of
the proposed dedication and to a cross section providing for dish gutters,
berms and a pavement width of not less than twenty feet. In such cases a
pavement meeting the minimum requirements of a waterbound macadam base having a
width of twenty feet and comprising a total depth of four inches, with the sub-
grade and course of base thoroughly consolidated by adequate rolling. On such
base course a surface course shall then be constructed consisting of three
inches of hot plant mixed asphaltic concrete with a width on center of the base
course of eighteen feet, using a prime coat over the base course of not less
than 0.50 gallon asphalt emulsion per square yard. As an alternate to the above
base requirement where water and/or sanitary sewers are not available, six
inches of graded road gravel meeting the State of Ohio Department of Highway
Specifications B-119 may be used. The asphaltic concrete surface course shall
be the same as required above.
   (g)   Minimum Paving Requirements Where Facilities Available. Where all
facilities, enumerated in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) hereof are
available then the pavement shall be of a width of at least twenty-six feet,
with curbs of stone or concrete, with a minimum pavement of type and thickness
as specified in subsection (f) hereof, except that one inch additional depth of
asphaltic concrete surfacing shall be added where existing pavement has been
installed prior to the request for approval of the plat.
      Since a full winter's settlement must be had after the completion of all
underground improvements before the pavement is installed, and if the building
will be occupied before the completion of the pavement, then a temporary slag
roadway, equal to the width of pavement as specified in this section and to a
depth of six inches shall be built and maintained to the satisfaction of the
Engineer, adequate to insure access to any occupied dwelling by any of the
equipment, fire, police or service. The top surface of such temporary pavement
shall be at least five inches below and parallel with the surface of the
finished pavement.
      When the pavement is constructed over such temporary pavement, providing
it has been maintained properly and meets with the approval of the Engineer for
weight or load capacity, then an additional base course of not less than two
inches thickness shall be constructed and thoroughly compacted prior to
application of the asphaltic concrete surface course.
      Before approval by the Planning Commission, plans, specifications and all
necessary details for the improvements specified in this section must have been
prepared by a registered Professional Engineer on tracing cloth to a scale of
one inch equals fifty feet with the signature and seal of such Registered
Engineer affixed thereto. Original tracings shall be furnished to and become
the property of the Municipality. All of such plans, specifications and details
must be first submitted to the Engineer and approved by him.
   (h)   Monuments. Monuments shall be set at such points as indicated on the
plat. At the end of the maintenance period the Engineer or the developer's
surveyor shall check the monuments and set such monuments as are lost,
disturbed or not set because of construction. The Engineer shall then report to
the Planning Commission when these monuments have been set and checked. Copies
of this letter shall be sent to the developer and Council. The cost of
replacing, setting or resetting such monuments shall be paid by the developer
or his surety.
   (i)   Street Signs; Markers. Street signs or markets or both shall be
installed according to specifications of the Engineer at the same time as the
street paving. All street signs or markers shall be purchased through the
Municipality and shall be charged as part of the developer's performance and
included in his bond at the same price as the cost to the Municipality, plus
ten percent (10%).
   (j)   Street Lighting. Street lighting shall be installed and constructed by
the developer and the developer shall execute and deliver to the Municipality
such petitions, consents, waivers, and consents to assessments for cost of same
as may be required by the Planning Commission. The spacing, distances and
intensity of all street lighting shall be subject to the approval of the
Engineer.
   (k)   Concrete Driveway Approaches. Where concrete curbs and gutters are
installed, the developer shall also provide concrete driveway approaches
meeting such standards and specifications as may be recommended by the Planning
Commission and the Engineer.
   The Planning Commission may waive the construction or installation of any of
the improvements if in its opinion due, to special circumstances, conditions or
other reasons, the public health, safety and welfare are not jeopardized, and
provided it first obtains the consent of three-fourths of the members of
Council to do so.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17-95.)
1181.06 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   Should it not be necessary, in the opinion of the Engineer and Planning
Commission, to install and construct all the improvements required in Section
1181.05 before the submission of the plat to the Planning Commission for
approval, then such plat may nevertheless be approved, provided that a suitable
performance bond, signed by a corporate surety authorized to transact business
in Ohio, is given to the Municipality by the owner. Such performance bond must
be acceptable to the Planning Commission and approved as to the amount by the
Engineer, and as to the legal form and acceptability of the surety by the Law
Director, and shall provide that the work shall be performed in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Planning Commission and which shall indemnify
and save harmless the Municipality from any and all actions, loss, injury,
damage, liability or expense, including attorney fees and court costs, of
whatsoever nature, by reason of the failure default, neglect or improper
performance of the conditions required to be done and performed before the
acceptance and approval of the final plat.
(Ord. 3-95. Passed 1-17- 95.)
1181.07 PERMITS.
   No zoning, building, or occupancy permit shall be issued prior to the
completion of all the improvements specified in Section
1181.05 hereof, or to the filing of the bonds as specified in Section
1181.06.
1181.08 COPIES OF PLATS.
   In order for the various service departments of the Municipality to
anticipate the increased demand for services imposed by further development of
land, the following departments shall be provided one copy each of the
preliminary and final plats, such copies to be delivered to the Planning
Commission at the time of submission to it for approvals:

the Engineer to cover the cost and expense of such investigation as may be
necessary to determine whether such proposed allotment conforms to this
Ordinance or its improvements have been made or are being installed in
accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance and the plans and
specifications approved by the Engineer. The cost and expense of such
investigation made by the Engineer or his assistants shall be paid from such
deposit upon itemized bills rendered by such Engineer. In case such
expenditures exceed such deposit, the excess shall, upon demand by the Planning
Commission, be paid by the owner, forthwith into the Treasury. In case the
deposit exceeds such expenditure, the balance will be refunded to the applicant
within a reasonable time after the completion of such preliminary
investigation.
   (c)   An engineering supervision and construction inspection fee in an
amount equal to 7½% of the total estimated cost of construction of all
facilities shall be deposited with the Municipality to defray the cost of
services rendered by the Engineer in supervising the construction of
facilities. Council, upon recommendation of the Engineer, shall increase this
amount if the engineering costs exceed the deposit. If the deposit exceeds the

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC) as
adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, Department of Industrial
Relations, and as published by the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) currently in
effect and as amended from time to time utilizing the then- existing Code in
the application and enforcement by the City.
(Ord. 09-2012. Passed 7-17-12.)
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
(OBC 101.3)
1301.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.7 of the Ohio Building Code.
   Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, if any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction. This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller. (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured

1345.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of Munroe Falls, State of Ohio, does ordain this chapter.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1345.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Summit County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective July 20, 2009.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City as required by
1345.27 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 43 Munroe Falls Avenue Munroe Falls, Ohio.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances,
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 5-19-09.)
1345.11   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.” A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal.” A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood.” The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE).” The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   (e)   “Basement.” Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development.” Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor. See "lowest floor."
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).” The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.” A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “flooding.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHEM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).” An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones.” Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation.” The flood protection elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office;
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Flood Prevention
Regulations, June 21, 1988, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as "areas of special flood
hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. “Permanent construction” does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

1345.23   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood

source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1345.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
   (b)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (b)(1) to (b)(11) of
this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
