Pertinent sections of the Revised Code of Ohio relative to these offices and

before entering upon official duties, shall take an oath to support the
Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State and an oath
that the officer will faithfully, honestly, and impartially discharge the

§ 30.06 SUFFICIENCY OF FORM OF BOND.

faithfully perform the duties of the office shall be sufficient. The fact that
the instrument is without a seal, that blanks like the date or amount have been
filled subsequent to its execution but before its acceptance, without the
consent of the sureties, that all the obligees named in the instrument have not
signed it, that new duties have been imposed on the officers or that any merely
formal objection exists shall not be available in any suit on the instrument.

   The legislative power of each village shall be vested in, and exercised by,
a legislative authority, composed of six members, who shall be elected by the
electors of the village at large, for terms of four years.
(R.C. § 731.09) ('81 Code § 32.01)
§ 32.02 PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE COUNCIL.
   (A)   At the first meeting in January of each year, the Council shall
immediately proceed to elect a president pro tempore from its own number, who
shall serve until the first meeting in January next after his election. The
Council may provide employees for the village as it determines, and employees
may be removed at any regular meeting by a majority of the members elected to
the Council.
   (B)   When the Mayor is absent from the village, or is unable, for any
cause, to perform his duties, the president pro tempore shall be the acting
Mayor, and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as the Mayor.

village. No member of the Council shall hold any other public office, be
interested in any contract with the village, or hold employment with the
village, except that a member may be a notary public, a member of the state
militia, or a volunteer fireman of the village. The Council member shall be
eligible to receive compensation for his services as a volunteer fireman of the
village, or as an emergency medical technician (EMT) in addition to his
compensation as a member of Council. Any member who ceases to possess any of
these qualifications, or who removes from the village, shall forfeit his
office. The purpose of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this
section is to recognize that the state has a substantial and compelling
interest in encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of
member of the Council by ensuring that a candidate for the office has every
opportunity to become knowledgeable with and concerned about the problems and
needs of the area he seeks to represent. In enacting this requirement, the
general assembly finds that the one-year period is reasonably related to this
purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person's right to travel, to vote, and to
be a candidate for public office.

term of office at a meeting held not later than five days prior to the last day
fixed by law for filing as a candidate for such office. All bonds shall be made
with sureties subject to the approval of the Mayor. The compensation so fixed
shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which any officer is
elected or appointed. This section does not prohibit the payment of any
increased costs of continuing to provide the identical benefits provided to an
officer at the commencement of his term of office.

§ 32.06 VACANCY.

be filled by election by the Council for the unexpired term. If the Council
fails within 30 days to fill the vacancy, the Mayor shall fill it by
appointment, except that, when the vacancy occurs because of operation of R.C.
§ 733.25, the successor shall hold office only for the period the president pro
tempore of the Council holds the office of Mayor.

less number may adjourn from day to day and compel attendance of absent members
in a manner and under penalties as are prescribed by ordinance. The legislative
authority shall provide rules for the manner of calling special meetings.
(R.C. § 731.44) ('81 Code § 32.07)

and criminal cases in the Mayor's court that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor's court, as set forth in §
33.01 and R.C. § 1905.01. No person shall be appointed as a Mayor's Court
Magistrate unless the person has been admitted to the practice of law in this
state and, for a total of at least three years preceding his appointment or the

division is entitled to hear and determine prosecutions and criminal cases in
the Mayor's Court that are within the jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court, as set

of R.C. § 1905.03(C), or is prohibited from hearing or determining any other
prosecution or cause due to the operation of R.C. § 1905.031(C), the
prohibition against the Mayor hearing or determining the prosecution or causes
does not affect and shall not be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or
authority of a person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under this
division to hear and determine the prosecution or cause in accordance with this
section. In hearing and determining such prosecutions and causes, the
magistrate has the same powers, duties, and authority as does a Mayor who
conducts a Mayor's Court to hear and determine prosecutions and causes in
general, including, but not limited to, the power and authority to decide the
prosecution or cause, enter judgement, and impose sentence; the powers, duties,

any provisions of the Revised Code, in relation to the hearing and
determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor's Courts. A judgement entered
and a sentence imposed by a Mayor's Court Magistrate do not have to be reviewed
or approved by the Mayor who appointed the Magistrate, and have the same force
and effect as if they had been entered or imposed by the Mayor.
      (2)   A person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under this
division is not entitled to hear or determine any prosecution or criminal cause
other than prosecutions and causes that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor's court, as set forth in §

shall pay the compensation for the services of the Magistrate, which shall be
either a fixed annual salary set by the Council or a fixed annual amount or
fees for services rendered set under a contract the Magistrate and the
municipal corporation enter into.
   (B)   The appointment of a person as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under
division (A) of this section does not preclude the Mayor that appointed him,
subject to the limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.03 and the limitation
contained in R.C. § 1905.031, from also hearing and determining prosecutions
and criminal causes in the Mayor's court that are within the jurisdiction of
the Mayor's court, as set forth in §
33.01 and R.C. § 1905.01.
(R.C. § 1905.05)

accordance with R.C. § 5705.09. The use of these funds shall be in accordance
with R.C. § 1907.261.

of the village in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.

civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused

with a governmental or proprietary function, as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, the village is
liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent
operation of any motor vehicle by its employees when the employees are engaged
within the scope of their employment and authority. The following are full
defenses to that liability:
         (a)   A member of a municipal corporation police department or any
other police agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an

wanton misconduct;

commercial driver's license issued pursuant to Ch. 4506 or a driver's license

constitute willful or wanton misconduct, and the operation complies with the
precautions of R.C. § 4511.03.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. §§ 3314.07 and 3746.24, the
village is liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by
the negligent performance of acts by its employees with respect to proprietary
functions of the village.
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, the village is
liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by its negligent
failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove

liability, when a bridge within the village is involved, that the village does
not have the responsibility for maintaining or inspecting the bridge.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, the village is
liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by the
negligence of its employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is
due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in
connection with the performance of a governmental function, including, but not
limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but not including jails, places
of juvenile detention, workhouses, or any other detention facility, as defined
in R.C. § 2921.01.
      (5)   In addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)

to person or property when civil liability is expressly imposed upon the
village by a section of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, R.C.
§§ 2743.02 and 5591.37. Civil liability shall not be construed to exist under
another section of the Revised Code merely because that section imposes a
responsibility or mandatory duty upon the village, because that section
provides for a criminal penalty, because of a general authorization in that
section that the village may sue and be sued, or because that section uses the
term "shall" in a provision pertaining to a political subdivision.
   (C)   An order that denies the village or an employee of the village the
benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or
any other provision of the law is a final order.
(R.C. § 2744.02)
§ 36.03 DEFENSES AND IMMUNITIES.
   (A)   In a civil action brought against the village or an employee of the
village to recover damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property
allegedly caused by any act or omission in connection with a governmental or
proprietary function, the following defenses or immunities may be asserted to

      (1)   The village is immune from liability if the employee involved was
engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial, prosecutorial,
legislative, or quasi-legislative function.
      (2)   The village is immune from liability if the conduct of the employee

liability was required by law or authorized by law, or if the conduct of the
employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was necessary or
essential to the exercise of powers of the village or employee.
      (3)   The village is immune from liability if the action or failure to
act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was
within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy making, planning,
or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and responsibilities of the
office or position of the employee.
      (4)   The village is immune from liability if the action or failure to
act by the village or employee involved that gave rise to the claim of
liability, resulted in injury or death to a person who had been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who, at the time of the injury or
death, was serving any portion of his sentence by performing community service
work for or in the village whether pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 or otherwise, or
resulted in injury or death to a child who was found to be a delinquent child
and who, at the time of the injury or death, was performing community service
or community work for or in the village in accordance with the order of a
juvenile court entered pursuant to R.C. § 2152.19 or 2152.20, and if, at the

covered for purposes of R.C. Ch. 4123 in connection with the community service
or community work for or in the village.
      (5)   The village is immune from liability if the injury, death, or loss
to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in
determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials,

was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless
manner.

following applies:
         (a)   The employee's acts or omissions were manifestly outside the
scope of his employment or official responsibilities;
         (b)   The employee's acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in
bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;
         (c)   Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a
section of the Revised Code. Civil liability shall not be construed to exist
under another section of the Revised Code merely because that section imposes a
responsibility or mandatory duty upon an employee, because that section
provides for a criminal penalty, because of a general authorization in that
section that an employee may sue and be sued, or because the section uses the
term "shall" in a provision pertaining to an employee.
      (7)   The village, and an employee who is the chief legal officer of the
village, an assistant of any such person, or a judge of a court of this state,
is entitled to any defense or immunity available at common law or established
by the Revised Code.
   (B)   Any immunity or defense conferred upon, or referred to in connection
with, an employee by division (A)(6) or (7) of this section does not affect or
limit any liability of the village for an act or omission of the employee as
provided in §
36.02 above.

§ 36.06 PROVISION OF EMPLOYEES' DEFENSE; CONSENT JUDGMENTS.
   (A)   Defense of actions against employees.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, the village shall
provide for the defense of an employee, in any state or federal court, in any
civil action or proceeding which contains an allegation for damages for injury,
death, or loss to person or property caused by an act or omission of the
employee in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The village
has the duty to defend the employee if the act or omission occurred while the
employee was acting in good faith and not manifestly outside the scope of his
employment or official responsibilities. Amounts expended by the village in the
defense of its employees shall be from funds appropriated for this purpose or
from proceeds of insurance. The duty to provide for the defense of an employee
specified in this division does not apply in a civil action or proceeding that
is commenced by or on behalf of the village.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, the village shall
indemnify and hold harmless an employee in the amount of any judgment, other
than a judgment for punitive or exemplary damages, that is obtained against the
employee in a state or federal court or as a result of a law of a foreign
jurisdiction and that is for damages for injury, death, or loss to person or
property caused by an act or omission in connection with a governmental or
proprietary function, if at the time of the act or omission the employee was
acting in good faith and within the scope of his employment or official
responsibilities.
   (B)   Consent judgments.
      (1)   The village may enter into a consent judgment or settlement and may
secure releases from liability for itself or an employee, with respect to any
claim for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by an act or
omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.
      (2)   No action or appeal of any kind shall be brought by any person,
including any employee or a taxpayer, with respect to the decision of the
village pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section whether to enter into a
consent judgment or settlement or to secure releases, or concerning the amount
and circumstances of a consent judgment or settlement. Amounts expended for any
settlement shall be from funds appropriated for this purpose.
   (C)   Failure to provide defense. If the village refuses to provide an
employee with a defense in a civil action or proceeding as described in
division (A)(1) of this section, upon the motion of the village, the court
shall conduct a hearing regarding the village’s duty to defend the employee in
that civil action. The village shall file the motion within 30 days of the
close of discovery in the action. After the motion is filed, the employee shall
have not less than 30 days to respond to the motion. At the request of the
village or the employee, the court shall order the motion to be heard at an
oral hearing. At the hearing on the motion, the court shall consider all
evidence and arguments submitted by the parties. In determining whether a
village has a duty to defend the employee in the action, the court shall
determine whether the employee was acting both in good faith and not manifestly
outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities. The pleadings
shall not be determinative of whether the employee acted in good faith or was
manifestly outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities. If the
court determines that the employee was acting both in good faith and not
manifestly outside the scope of employment or official responsibilities, the
court shall order the village to defend the employee in the action.

§ 38.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM.
   (A)   Establishment. In order to facilitate its drug-free workplace policy,
the village hereby establishes a drug and alcohol testing program of its
employees. As part of the program, there are six levels of testing for village
employees:
      (1)   Pre-employment drug testing;
      (2)   Random drug testing conducted by the provider of such service
contracted by the village;
      (3)   Reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal
drugs or alcohol;
      (4)   On the job injuries where personal injury or damage to real or
personal property of the village or others occurs;
      (5)   Follow-up program to treatment for drug or alcohol abuse; and
      (6)   Voluntary program for those who wish to participate in the program.
   (B)   Pre-employment drug testing. All job applicants of the village will
undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment.
Any applicant with a positive test result will be denied employment with the
village. The village will not discriminate against applicants for employment
because of a past history of drug abuse. Therefore, any person who has failed a
pre-employment drug test may initiate another application for employment with
the village after a period of not less than six months, but must present drug-
free.
   (C)   Employee testing. The village has adopted testing practices to
identify employees who use illegal drugs and/or alcohol on or off the job. It
shall be a condition of employment for all employees to submit to drug and/or
alcohol testing under the circumstances outlined in subsections (2) - (6)
above. Any employee who tests positive under any of the circumstances outlined
above, shall be subjected to the following consequences:
      (1)   First offense. The employee shall undergo mandatory counseling and
treatment, as directed by the provider of these services with whom the village
has contracted. After the employee returns to work after a positive test
result, the employee will be placed on three months of probation. At the end of
the three month probation period, the employee must follow up with another drug
test and present to work drug-free.
      (2)   Second offense. The employee will be immediately terminated, either
on probation or after the end of the probationary period.
   (D)   Testing categories. The following categories of employees shall be
subject to random drug and/or alcohol testing:
      (1)   Group 1. All members of the safety forces of the village, i.e.
members of the police department, including auxiliary police officers, fire
department, and emergency medical services, whether paid employees or
volunteers;
      (2)   Group 2. All full-time and part-time employees of the village;
      (3)   Group 3. All employees, whether full-time or part-time, who hold a
Commercial Driver's License; and
      (4)   Group 4. All other village officials, either elected or appointed,
who volunteer on an annual basis to participate in the random testing program.
   (E)   Testing procedure. Each calendar year, 10% of the total number of
members of the above groups shall be randomly tested. The drug test shall
screen them for the following illegal drugs: Amphetamines; Barbiturates;
Benzodiazepines; Cannabinoids; Cocaine; Opiates; and PCP. The alcohol test will
be conducted either by the agency with whom the village has contracted for drug
and alcohol testing or by an outside law enforcement agency which has a breath
testing machine approved by the Ohio Department of Health. In the event there
is an emergency or when there is no available transportation off of the island,
the Kelleys Island Police Department breath testing machine shall be used.

member who is afflicted with a serious illness or injury, and has, or is likely

within one year of from the time the monies are expended. Said reimbursement

EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINARY ACTION
§ 38.15 CAUSES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
   (A)    The following are among the non-exclusive causes which shall be
sufficient for disciplinary action being taken against an employee, including
reprimand, suspension, demotion, and discharge, except employees of the Police
Department who are subject to including §
34.06 of this code:
      (1)   Absence without leave or failure to return from leave;
      (2)   Conduct unbecoming an employee in the public service;
      (3)   Inability to perform duties due to mental or physical disability of
a permanent or temporary nature;
      (4)   Incompetency, inefficiency or neglect of duty;
      (5)   Insubordination;
      (6)   Under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on duty;
      (7)   Consumption of alcoholic beverages, controlled substances or other
non-prescribed drugs while on duty;
      (8)   Neglectful, or willful and wanton damage to public property;
      (9)   Violation of any lawful or reasonable regulation, directive or
order given by a superior;
      (10)   Violation of any enacted or promulgated statute, ordinance, rule,
policy, regulation or other law; or
      (11)   Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor which adversely bears on the
employee's suitability for continued employment.
   (B)   No employee shall absent himself from duty without permission of his
supervisor. After 24 scheduled work hours of absence without reporting, the
supervisor shall present the case to Council, which may declare the position
vacant and report the employee as having resigned. Such a resignation may be
set aside, upon the recommendation of the Mayor, with the approval of Council,
if the employee submits, in writing to the Mayor through his supervisor, a
reasonable explanation for his failure to report the absence.
   (C)   If an employee is incapacitated, that is, being unable to perform his
work as normally he would, for 30 consecutive calendar days, the position can
be filled on a temporary basis until the employee can resume his duties.
Council will consider the temporary filling of a vacancy due to leave without
pay or extended leave (maternity leave and the like) on a case by case basis if
the temporary vacancy would not interfere with the accomplishment of public
services, unreasonably increase expenses of the village, or adversely affects
the performance or morale of other employees.

similar involves judgment on the part of the disciplinary authority which is
the Mayor with the consent of Council. Officials shall exercise their judgment
based upon:
      (1)   Particular facts of the case;
      (2)   The seriousness of the infraction; and
      (3)   The employee's past disciplinary history.
(Ord. 1998-O-52, passed 10-10-98)
§ 38.17 PROCEDURE.
   A report of such cause, incident or complaint may be brought either verbally
or in writing to the supervisor and shall be investigated as soon as is
possible to assure that prompt documentation is made. Investigation of each
complaint shall be accomplished within five days of receiving that complaint.
The supervisor shall take the following steps to investigate a complaint:

and the neuter.
      ADMINISTRATOR. The Clerk/Treasurer or his/her authorized representative.

      TRANSIENT GUEST. A person occupying a room or rooms for sleeping
accommodations for less than 30 consecutive days.
      VENDOR. The person who is the owner or operator of the hotel or motel and

(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.02 PURPOSE, RATE AND APPLICATION OF TAX.
   (A)   For the purpose of providing revenue for the village, there is hereby
levied an excise tax on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or motel is or
is to be furnished to transient guests. The tax shall be 2% of the amount paid
or to be paid by the transient guest for the lodging.
   (B)   The tax, which shall be known as the transient occupancy tax, applies
and is collectible at the time the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time
when the price is paid. The tax does not apply to lodging furnished to the
state or any of its political subdivisions. For the purpose of the proper
administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax, it is
presumed that all lodging furnished by hotels in the village to transient
guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is established.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.03 PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging. The tax required
to be collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust by the
vendor until paid to the Administrator as provided in §
40.06. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the vendor, the
Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the Administrator.
   (B)   No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the Administrator. All claims of exemption shall be made in the manner
prescribed by the Administrator.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.04 RECORDS.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon. Such records shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Administrator and shall be
preserved for a period of three years, unless the Administrator, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.05 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (A)   The tax shall be stated and charged separately from the charge for the
lodging and shall be shown separately on any record thereof at the time the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for the occupancy issued or
delivered by the vendor.
   (B)   No vendor shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
vendor, or that it will not be added to the amount charged for the lodging, or
that, if added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of the month, make and
file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the
Administrator, showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax
due from the vendor to the village for the period covered by the return, and
such other information as the Administrator deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The Administrator may extend the time for
making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by delivering or mailing the
same to the Administrator together with payment of the full amount of tax shown
to be due thereon.
   (B)   The Administrator may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not
such as to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Administrator upon fee
basis of administrative costs of the village, to make and file returns at less
frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate
the intervals at which returns are to be filed.
   (C)   All claims for exemption from tax filed by transient guests with the
vendor during the reporting period shall be filed with the return.
   (D)   All returns and payments submitted by each vendor shall be treated as
confidential by the Administrator and shall not be released by him or her
except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or
agent of the United States, the state, the county or the village, for official
use only.
   (E)   The Administrator, if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure
the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and
payments to be made for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed
by the vendor or his or her authorized agent.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.07 REFUNDS.
   The Administrator shall refund or grant credits to vendors for the amount of
taxes paid illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous
assessment where the vendor had not reimbursed himself or herself from the
transient guest. A transient guest may obtain a refund or credit for the amount
of taxes paid illegally or erroneously but only when the tax was paid by the
transient guests directly to the Administrator. No refund shall be paid unless
the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing
his or her entitlement thereto and makes a claim in writing on forms furnished
by the Administrator, stating, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds
upon which the claim is founded. Such claim shall be filed with the
Administrator within three years of the date of payment.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.08 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION BY ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   If any vendor fails or refuses to collect the transient occupancy tax
or to file a return and to make a remittance of the tax or any portion thereof,
as required by this chapter, the Administrator shall proceed in such manner as
he or she deems best to obtain information on which to base his or her estimate
of the tax due. When the Administrator has such information as he or she is
able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any vendor who has failed or refused to collect the same
or to file a return and to make a remittance of the proper amount thereof, he
or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such vendor the tax,
penalty and interest provided for in this chapter.
   (B)   In case such determination is made, the Administrator shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by registered or
certified mail. Such vendor may, within ten days after the serving or mailing
of such notice, make application in writing to the Administrator for a hearing
on the amount assessed. If application by the vendor is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, penalty and interest determined by the Administrator
shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such
application is made, the Administrator shall give not less than five days
written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the vendor to show
cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for such tax, penalty and interest. At any such hearing,
the vendor may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, penalty and
interest should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Administrator shall
determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written
notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such
determination and the amount of such tax, penalty and interest. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.09 APPEALS.

§ 40.10 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the village.
Any such tax collected by a vendor which has not been paid to the village shall
be deemed a debt owed by the vendor to the village. Any person owing money to
the village under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the village for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.11 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Administrator shall have power to adopt rules and regulations, not
inconsistent with the terms of this chapter, for carrying out and enforcing the
payment, collection and remittance of the transient occupancy tax. A copy of
such rules and regulations shall be published, as in the case of ordinances,
before they become effective and copies shall be printed and made available in
the office of the Administrator.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.12 INTERPRETATION.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy an excise tax of 3% on transactions
by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests as
referred to and authorized by R.C. § 5739.02(C). Accordingly, this chapter
shall be construed to effectuate that purpose and so as to be consistent with
any requirement of law, compliance with which is a prerequisite to the validity
of the tax intended to be levied hereby.
(Ord. 2018-O-29, passed 11-10-18)
§ 40.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any vendor who fails to collect or remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of the amount
of the tax and interest at the rate of 6% per year upon the unpaid amount in
addition to the tax.
   (B)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty

approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the
Board of Trustees of Public Affairs or its designated agent and shall have
inspections and tests made of such approved devices as required by the Board of
Trustees of Public Affairs.

system or systems thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any
property so served shall furnish to the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs or
its duly authorized representative, any information which he may request
regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property. The
refusal of such information, when demanded by the Board of Trustees of Public

the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs, be deemed prima facie evidence of the
presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (E)   The Board of Trustees of Public Affairs of the village is hereby
authorized and directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant
thereof, the water service to any property wherein any connection in violation
of the provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such other

shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left, unless a sign at the place prohibits
either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles, and pedestrians lawfully within
the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. The vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in § 70.24, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole
green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked
or unmarked crosswalk.

before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross
the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the

except as provided in divisions (C) (2) and (3) of this section.
      (2)   Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a right turn as provided in
division (C) (5) of this section, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal
may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as
required by division (C) (1) of this section. Such vehicular traffic shall

steady red signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs
giving notice thereof are posted at the intersection.

maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but, in the absence of
any sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

lane over which this signal is shown for only the purpose of making a left
turn.

entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a

tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the persons own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the persons expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under § 73.011, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the persons expense. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission

   (C)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of this section, if a law enforcement officer has administered a
field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety

sobriety test so administered.
         (b)   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field sobriety
test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
         (c)   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (C)(1)(a) or (b) of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a court,
in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in
a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
division, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by division (C)(1) of this section.
   (D)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of having physical control of
a vehicle while under the influence, a misdemeanor of the first degree. In
addition to other sanctions imposed, the court may impose on the offender a
class seven suspension of the offenders drivers license, commercial drivers
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident

   (E)   Division (B)(3) of this section does not apply to a person who is in
physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the
persons whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the
amount specified in § 73.01(A)(1)(j) if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a

      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the persons whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the persons whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if
arrested for a violation of § 73.01(A) or (B), § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or
(B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any
other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in
physical control of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance
identified in division (A)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by
which the officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be
administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   The arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this section to any person under arrest for a violation of § 73.01(A) or
(B), § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The
officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains the information
described in division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the
person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the
person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or
more persons shall witness the arresting officers reading of the form, and the
witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must
submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the
arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and,
if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time
limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to
the test or tests.
   (C)   If a person is under arrest as described in division (B) of this
section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test or
tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite
of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI, OVUAC,
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
OVI, and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section to submit to a chemical
test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer
shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state drivers or commercial drivers license or
permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in which the
arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in
possession of the persons license or permit or it is not in the persons
vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested persons initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. § 4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (B) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if the officer advises the person in
accordance with this section of the consequences of the persons refusal or
submission, and if either the person refuses to submit to the test or tests or,
unless the arrest was for a violation of § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the persons
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
persons Ohio drivers or commercial drivers license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the persons initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the persons arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the drivers or commercial drivers license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the persons license or permit or it is not in the persons
vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officers employing
agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the persons current residence and, if it differs from
that on the persons drivers or commercial drivers license or permit, notify the
Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   That the officer asked the person to take the designated
chemical test or tests, advised the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and
gave the person the form described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   That either the person refused to submit to the chemical test
or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the
chemical test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration
of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance
in the persons whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the persons whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officers sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a persons drivers or commercial drivers license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
   (H)   (1)   A suspension of a persons drivers or commercial drivers license
or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the time
described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the time
at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the persons being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.012 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the persons drivers or commercial drivers license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the persons initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface, and
width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall
drive any motor vehicle, or streetcar in and upon any street or highway at a
greater speed than will permit him to bring it to a stop within the assured
clear distance ahead.
   (B)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared
pursuant to this section by the Director of Transportation or local
authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the same at a speed
not exceeding the following:
      (1)   (a)   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess
and while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when 20 miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected, except
that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by division (B)(4) of this section, and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by divisions (B)(9) and (B)(10) of this section. The end of every school zone
may be marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section
or in the Manual and Specifications for a Uniform System of Traffic-Control
Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         (b)   As used in this section, SCHOOL means any school chartered under
R.C. § 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed

Director of Transportation, the Director may extend the traditional school zone
boundaries. The distances in divisions (B)(1)(b) 1. through 3. below shall not
exceed 300 feet per approach per direction, and are bounded by whichever of the
following distances or combination thereof the Director approves as most

lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at

during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
in each appropriate direction of the state route.
      (2)   Twenty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the
municipality, except on state routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts, and alleys;

limitations in divisions (B)(1)(a), (B)(2), (B)(3), (B)(4), (B)(6), (B)(7) and
(B)(8) of this section or any declared pursuant to this section by the Director
or local authorities and it is unlawful for any person to exceed any of the
speed limitations in division (D) of this section. No person shall be convicted
of more than one violation of this section for the same conduct, although
violations of more than one provision of this section may be charged in the
alternative in a single affidavit.
   (D)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a street or highway as

LOADS
§ 74.50 PERMIT REQUIRED TO EXCEED LOAD LIMITS.
   (A)   The municipality, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction,
upon application in writing and for good cause shown, may issue a special
permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the
maximum specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in
conformity with R.C. §§ 4513.01 through 4513.37, upon any highway under its
jurisdiction.
   (B)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a special
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the special permit on any
highway that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly
within and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local
authority shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee
or other charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
   (C)   The application for a permit shall be in the form that the
municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe a permit fee to be
imposed and collected when any permit described in this section is issued. The
permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse the municipality for the
administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit, and also to cover the cost
of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway
structure as the result of the operation of the nonconforming vehicle or
combination of vehicles. For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted
by the Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is
deemed a nondivisible load.
   (D)   The municipality may issue or withhold a permit. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (E)   Every permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police
officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit. No person
shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
(R.C. § 4513.34)
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

is so constructed, loaded, or covered as to prevent any of its load from
dropping, sifting, leaking, or otherwise escaping therefrom, except that sand
or other substance may be dropped for the purpose of securing traction, or
water or other substance may be sprinkled on a roadway in cleaning or
maintaining the roadway.

agricultural production materials or a rubbish vehicle in the process of
acquiring its load, no vehicle loaded with garbage, swill, cans, bottles, waste
paper, ashes, refuse, trash, rubbish, waste, wire, paper, cartons, boxes,
glass, solid waste, or any other material of an unsanitary nature that is
susceptible to blowing or bouncing from a moving vehicle shall be driven or
moved on any highway unless the load is covered with a sufficient cover to
prevent the load or any part of the load, from spilling onto the highway.
(R.C. § 4513.31)
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

      (3)   In addition to such drawbar or other connection, each trailer and
each semitrailer which is not connected to a commercial tractor by means of a
fifth wheel shall be coupled with stay chains or cables to the vehicle by which
it is being drawn. These chains or cables shall be of sufficient size and
strength to prevent the towed vehicle's parting from the drawing vehicle in
case the drawbar or other connection should break or become disengaged. In case
of a loaded pole trailer, the connecting pole to the drawing vehicle shall be
coupled to the drawing vehicle with stay chains or cables of sufficient size
and strength to prevent the towed vehicle's parting from the drawing vehicle.
      (4)   Every trailer or semitrailer, except pole and cable trailers and
pole and cable dollies operated by a public utility as defined in R.C. §
5727.01, shall be equipped with a coupling device which shall be so designed
and constructed that the trailer will follow substantially in the path of the
vehicle drawing it, without whipping or swerving from side to side. Vehicles
used to transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials
between a local place of storage and supply and the farm, when drawn or towed
on a street or highway at a speed of 25 miles per hour or less, and vehicles
designed and used exclusively to transport a boat between a place of storage
and a marina, or in and around a marina, when drawn or towed on a street or
highway for a distance of no more than ten miles and at a speed of 25 miles per
hour or less, shall have a drawbar or other connection, including the hitch
mounted on the towing vehicle, which shall be of sufficient strength to pull
all the weight towed thereby. Only one such vehicle used to transport
agricultural produce or agricultural production materials as provided in this
section may be towed or drawn at one time, except as follows:
         (a)   An agricultural tractor may tow or draw more than one such
vehicle;
         (b)   A pickup truck or straight truck designed by the manufacturer to
carry a load of not less than one-half ton and not more than two tons may tow
or draw not more than two such vehicles that are being used to transport
agricultural produce from the farm to a local place of storage. No vehicle
being so towed by such a pickup truck or straight truck shall be considered to
be a motor vehicle.
(R.C. § 4513.32)
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense within one year after the first offense, the person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(R.C. § 4513.99)
   (C)   Exception to size and weight restrictions.
      (1)   The size and weight provisions of this chapter and R.C. Chapter
5577 do not apply to a person who is engaged in the initial towing or removal
or a wrecked or disabled motor vehicle from the site of an emergency on a
public highway where the vehicle became wrecked or disabled to the nearest site
where the vehicle can be brought into conformance with the requirements of this
chapter and R.C. Chapter 5577 or to the nearest qualified repair facility.
      (2)   Any subsequent towing of a wrecked or disabled vehicle shall comply
with the size and weight provisions of this chapter and R.C. Chapter 5577.
      (3)   No court shall impose any penalty prescribed in R.C. § 5577.99, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or the civil liability
established in R.C. § 5577.12 upon a person towing or removing a vehicle in the
manner described in division (C)(1) of this section.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 95.01 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO IMPROVING STREETS.
   (A)   In regard to streets which have been platted and dedicated to public
use prior to the date of this section, no department of the village shall
accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, curb or light any street or other
way, unless the street or way has been accepted or opened or otherwise has
received the legal status of a public street or way prior to the effective date
of this code, or unless the street or way corresponds in location and extent
with a street or way shown on a recorded plat which has been legally accepted
by Council. Evidence that a street or other way has been accepted or otherwise
has received the legal status of a public street or way shall include, but not
be limited to:
      (1)   Title insurance being issued on the subject property by a title
company licensed to do business in the State of Ohio; or
      (2)   A judgment entry from a court of competent jurisdiction as a result
of a declaratory judgment, quiet title action or other legal action regarding
the subject property declaring the street or other way to be a public street or
other way.
   Notwithstanding the above, if all of the property owners adjacent to the
street or other way consent to the laying out, opening, improving, grading,
paving, curbing or lighting of the street or other way as set forth in the
application, the application may be approved by the village.
   (B)   No person shall open, improve, grade, pave, curb or light any existing
street or other way as set forth on a recorded plat which has been legally
accepted by Council, until that person obtains the approval of the village. Any
person making application for approval to open, improve, grade, pave, curb or
light any existing street or other way as set forth on a recorded plat which
has been legally accepted by Council, shall provide the following materials, in
addition to the application, to the Street Commissioner or Mayor, and one
member of the Streets and Sidewalks Committee prior to beginning construction
of the proposed improvement:
      (1)   A certified copy of the plat which has been legally accepted by
Council; and
      (2)   A set of plans, drawn to scale, which show the location of both
existing and proposed public utilities, including but not limited to electric,
gas, water, sewer, and storm water drainage facilities, type of surface
material to be utilized, and showing all obstructions to be removed (both
natural and man-made).
      In addition, any existing street or other way as set forth on a recorded
plat which has been legally accepted by Council, shall be developed to a
maximum width of 18 feet, equidistant from the centerline as shown on the
recorded plat unless otherwise approved or required by Council. If necessary,
Council may initiate vacation proceedings to vacate any excess right-of-way
which Council determines to be unnecessary for public use. Council shall
prescribe the necessary application form to effectuate the purpose of this
section. However, in the event a majority of the adjacent property owners make
application for an assessed project pursuant to R.C. § 727.06, the street may
be developed to a width greater than 18 feet, except in the case of any
structure or part thereof or any other obstruction which may encroach upon or
lie within the right-of-way which exists on the effective date of Ordinance
1997-O-9 (passed 2-15-97) as approved by the Street Commissioner or Mayor and
one member of the Streets and Sidewalks Committee prior to beginning
construction of the proposed improvement.
      For the purpose of this chapter, the meaning of the words "Open or
Opening" shall include both the opening of an existing street for the purposes
of installing utilities, storm water drainage systems, or other subterranean
improvements and the original opening of a previously undeveloped street or
other way, by the removal of trees, vegetation, or any other obstructions, both
natural and man made, and other grading, clearing, paving or improving the land
within the boundaries of the street or other way as approved by Council. The
filling of pot holes and the leveling of an existing street or other way shall
not be considered an opening under this section, but shall be deemed to be
regular maintenance.
   (C)   Notwithstanding subsections (A) and (B), the Mayor, with the approval
of Council, may issue a permit to open streets or other ways where the
ownership of the street or other way has not been determined, if the applicant
for the permit executes an agreement to defend, indemnify, and hold the village
harmless against all loss, cost or expense which the village may incur as a
result of issuing a permit authorized by this section.

kind of paving, the area and depth to be excavated and such other facts as may
be provided for. The applicant shall pay to the village a permit fee of $250
and the applicant shall post either $500 cash or a surety bond in the amount of
$2,000 to cover the cost and supervision of backfilling, repairing, restoring
and relaying the pavement to its former condition. The amount of the deposit or
surety bond may be increased when the nature, size and location of the proposed
opening warrants such increase, which shall be determined by the Streets/
Sidewalk Committee.
   (B)   Before any permit is issued, the applicant shall also deposit with the
village an insurance policy, issued by a company authorized to write insurance
in the state of Ohio, designating the village as a named insured therein, by
the terms of which the village is saved harmless from any and all claims for
bodily injury within the limits of $500,000 for each person and $1,000,000 for
each incident and for property damage claims in the amount of $50,000 for each

the permit is obtained, or in any manner arising or growing out of the work
necessary or incident to the issuance of the permit or that may be occasioned
by reason of any opening or anything else done pursuant to the permit issued

village ordinance, state or federal law, and agrees, in the event of default,
to reimburse the village for any additional costs incurred by the village
beyond the deposit required for such opening in restoring the pavement to its
former condition.

   (B)   Upon failure or refusal of the permittee satisfactorily to fill the
excavation, restore the surface, and remove all excess materials within the
time specified in the permit or where not specified therein, within a
reasonable time after commencement of the work, the village may proceed without
notice to make such fill and restoration and the deposit referred to in §
95.03 shall be deemed forfeited. Thereupon the deposit shall be paid into the
street repair fund of the municipality, except such part demanded and paid to
the permittee as the difference between the deposit and the charges of the
village for restoration services performed by it. If the amount of such
services performed by the village should exceed the amount of the deposit, the
clerk or other proper administrative officer shall proceed to collect the
remainder due from such permittee.
('81 Code § 95.04)
§ 95.05 BARRIERS AROUND EXCAVATIONS.

required to provide an accurate plat of the property to be vacated prepared by
an engineer, along with a proper legal description. In addition, the petitioner
shall submit with his or her petition an appraisal of the fair market value of
the property to be vacated, prepared by a certified appraiser. This appraisal
shall be the amount of compensation to be paid to the village for the vacation
of the right-of-way. In the event either the petitioner or the village is
dissatisfied with the first appraisal, either the petitioner or the village
may, at the petitioner's or the village's expense, hire another appraiser, and
a third appraiser mutually agreed upon by both the petitioner and the village.
The amount of compensation to the village for the right- of-way to be vacated
shall be the average of the three appraisals.
      (2)   At the time any lot owner petitions the Council to vacate a street,
alley or any part thereof, the lot owner shall deposit with the village an
amount of money equal to the fair market value of the property to be vacated,
as determined by the certified appraiser or the average appraisal price as
determined by three appraisers as set forth above, to defray all costs and
expenses incurred by the village in processing the petition. In the event the
street, alley or part thereof sought to be vacated does not become vacated, the
petitioner will receive a refund of the deposit, minus any expenses actually
incurred by the village relative to the processing of the petition, including
but not limited to advertising fees and attorney fees for the preparation of
the appropriate legislation. Any and all fees relative to the vacation of a
street or alley may be waived at the discretion of the Council, if Council
determines that it would be in the best interest of the village.
      (3)   When the petition is complete, the Clerk of Council shall present
the petition at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Council, after such
time the petition may be referred to the Planning Commission for its
consideration and recommendation.
      (4)   The Planning Commission shall thereafter refer the petition to the
Village Solicitor for preparation of the appropriate legislation.
      (5)   Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission,
Council shall cause to be published for a period of six consecutive weeks,
notice of intention to vacate, unless all of the abutting property owners
consent to the vacation of the street or alley or part thereof.
      (6)   At the first Council meeting after the last publication of the
notice of intention to vacate, Council shall consider the ordinance on first,
second and third readings. Action on the petition shall take place within three
months after the completion of the notice as set forth in this subsection.
      (7)   Before the legislation vacating the property shall be adopted, the
petitioner shall have paid in full the fair market value of the property to be
vacated.
      (8)   If the ordinance is adopted by Council, the Clerk of Council shall
submit a certified copy of the ordinance to the Erie County Auditor's Office,
and thereafter to the Erie County Recorder's Office.
   (B)   Vacation by Council. Upon determination by Council that there is good
cause for vacating or narrowing a street or alley or any part thereof, other
than upon petition of an owner of a lot in the immediate vicinity, and upon a
further finding that such vacation ordinarily will not be detrimental to the
general interests of the citizens of the village, such street or alley may be
vacated after publication listed in division (A) of this section which shall be
given, except when all of the owners of the abutting property in the area of
the street or alley or any part thereof to be vacated have given written
consent to the vacation thereof.

§ 97.11 ACCESS TO THE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT.
   (A)   Purpose. In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of all
persons using the Kelleys Island Municipal Airport, both private and
commercial, the Council has determined that it is necessary to regulate persons
obtaining access to the municipal airport.
   (B)   Access. No person shall mow grass, plow snow or take any equipment
onto the municipal airport for any purpose whatsoever unless authorization is
granted by the Airport Manager or Mayor. No person, including adjacent property
owners, shall make any improvements, excavations, fill, repair, or otherwise
access the municipal airport for any reason unless authorized to do so. Access
to the municipal airport is limited solely to those areas designated on the
Airport Layout Plan as adopted by Council in Ordinance 2000-O-11, or as
otherwise amended, and that of the Airport Consulting Engineer as to the safest
location of ingress and egress.
   (C)   Aircraft access permit. The purpose of this regulation is to establish
guidelines for the ingress and egress of aircraft (provided that they are not
used for commercial purposes) from the municipal airport onto adjacent
residential private property and allows the village to address safety issues
related to all aircraft using the municipal airport.
      (1)   No person shall taxi an airplane either from the municipal airport
to residential property or from residential property to the municipal airport
without first obtaining an aircraft access permit from the village. The
aircraft access permit will be written in accordance with the Policy and
Procedures Memorandum Number 5190.6 of the U.S. Department of Transportation
Federal Aviation Administration and may contain other requirements deemed
necessary for the safe operation of ground traffic at the municipal airport. An
aircraft access permit may be issued only to those properties adjacent to the
airport that have an immediate need of access and who can ingress and egress an
active runway according to FAA rules and regulations. Only one aircraft access
permit will be granted to multi-property owners adjacent to the airport and it
will be the determination of the Airport Consulting Engineer as to the safest
location of the point of access. This section may be amended when a taxiway is
constructed parallel to an active runway. The application for the aircraft
access permit shall be on a form provided by the Airport Committee, and shall
be accompanied by the fee which shall be established from time to time by
Council.
      (2)   Aircraft access permits may be granted only after a full review by
the Airport Consulting Engineer and through a resolution adopted by the
Council. The aircraft access permit shall be of such a term as established by
Council. The aircraft access permit will automatically terminate upon a change
of ownership of the real estate that is the subject of the permit. No aircraft
access permit is transferable to any third party or successor in title.
Property owners whose land is adjacent to the municipal airport will make it
known to any potential buyers of their property that there is no access to the
airport runway from their property except through an aircraft access permit and
that any previously granted aircraft access permit is not transferable to any
potential buyer.
      (3)   The village reserves the right to revoke any aircraft access permit
or prohibit any person from the use of the municipal airport for any misuse,
neglect and/or the violation of the rules and regulations of the airport or any
state law or village ordinance relating to the use of the municipal airport.
      (4)   The applicant for an aircraft access permit or the holder of an
aircraft access permit whose permit has been revoked, may appeal any adverse
decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals
should be made no later than 30 calendar days after the date of any adverse
decision relative to the aircraft access permit. The appellant shall post
security in an amount that has been set by the Village Council for the cost of
all action required for the hearing of the appeal. This security shall be
refunded only if the appeal is withdrawn prior to the mailing of any hearing
notices.
      (5)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Airport Manager, with the advice of the Airport
Consulting Engineer, shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the
notice of the appeal has been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life
or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed by other than a
restraining order granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall schedule a hearing
within 45 days after the appeal is filed with the board. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be done, and
to that end shall have all the powers of the officers from whom the appeal is
taken, and it may direct the issuance of a license agreement. The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall decide all such appeals within 30 days after the date of
the hearing except that such time may be extended by mutual consent.
      (6)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, in deciding appeals under this
section, shall utilize the procedure set forth in §

qualified technician or chemist of his own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement

relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement
officer.
      (6)   A physician, registered nurse, qualified technician or chemist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first-

the court may require the offender to attend a drivers' intervention program
that is certified pursuant to R.C. § 3720.06.

of an offender sentenced pursuant to division (C)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section to continue his employment, the court may authorize that the offender
be granted work release from imprisonment after the offender has served the
three, ten, or thirty consecutive days of imprisonment that the court is
required by division (C)(1), (2), or (3) of this section to impose. No court
shall authorize work release from imprisonment during the three, ten, or thirty
consecutive days of imprisonment that the court is required by division (C)(1),
(2), or (3) of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall
not exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from
the place of employment and the place of imprisonment and the time actually
spent under employment.

placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of imprisonment, no
court shall suspend the ten or thirty consecutive days of imprisonment required

tree existing on any public property unless he first finds and determines that:
      (1)   The tree is diseased or permanently damaged;
      (2)   The tree or any part thereof constitutes a hazard to public safety;

property within the village becomes infected with any parasite, insect, pest or
fungus so as to threaten the scattering of such parasite, pest or fungus to
trees standing in any public place or when any tree on private property in the
village, because of decay or other condition, is in his opinion, apt to fall in
whole or in part across any sidewalk or other public place, the Village
Administrator shall cause written notice to be served upon the owner or
occupant of such private property whereon such tree exists, which notice shall
order the owner or occupant to spray or otherwise treat the tree or remove the
same in the manner and within the time provided in the written notice. In the

has not been performed as per the terms of the written notice, the Village
Administrator shall cause the work to be done at the expense of the owner. The
Village Administrator will obtain bids from two qualified tree companies and
the Village Administrator shall choose the best bid. The Village Administrator,
at the completion thereof, shall ascertain the total cost of the work and shall
bill the same to the owner at his address, if it is known, otherwise to the
owner in care of any person living upon or having charge of such premises. If
the address of the owner or any person having charge of the premises is unknown
and the premises are vacant, then the bill shall be presented by posting it in
a conspicuous place upon such premises. The bill shall be payable by cash or
check within 30 days from and after the date of its delivery or posting as the
case may be.
   (B)   In computing the entire cost, if the work has been done by contract,
10% shall be added to the contract price as a reasonable overhead charge to pay
for service of notice, inspection and other incidentals. If the work has been
done by regular employees of the village, the entire cost shall be arrived at
as follows:
      (1)   The time expended thereon by such employee shall be charged at a
computed hourly rate determined by the employee's total compensation.

§ 115.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses within the village in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village. The provisions of this
chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication,
including sexually oriented businesses. Similarly, it is not the purpose or
effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (B)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community presented in hearings before
City Council; on findings incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v.
Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters,
426 U.S. 50 (1976); and on studies in other cities including New York, New
York; Islip, New York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Newport News, Virginia;
Denver, Colorado; and Kansas City, Missouri; along with Manatee County,
Florida; New Hanover County, North Carolina; and the State of Minnesota; this
Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide or semi-private
booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(5) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a
heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented
businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare
of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village. It is
appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the license is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control
of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (9)   The regulation of nudity in sexually oriented businesses will
further the substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and
other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public
health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)   Removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses
and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance
the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary
sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (11)   Requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses
will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual
activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses, and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (12)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the substantial government interest in
protecting the public health, safety and welfare.
      (13)   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually
oriented business or adult motel.
      (14)   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and
prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct
which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

license or sexually oriented business employee license upon request of the
applicant. The provisional license:
      (1)   Will allow an applicant for a sexually oriented business license to
operate the sexually oriented business or adult motel named in the license

issued pursuant to § 115.07 for the period of time specified in division (G) of

employee license issued pursuant to § 115.09 of this chapter for the period of
time specified in division (G) of this section; and

   (H)   In the event that judicial review of the denial of a new license
application is still pending 30 days before the expiration date of a
provisional license, the provisional licensee may file a renewal license
application with the Mayor pursuant to § 115.12(B). The Mayor shall grant an
application for renewal of a provisional license unless he determines that new
grounds exist for denial of a license application pursuant to § 115.07 or §

the event that an application for renewal of a provisional license is denied
and the applicant seeks judicial review of that denial, the village has the
right to consolidate such review with the pending judicial appeal of the
previous license denial.

authorized by law to consent to medical treatment on behalf of the pregnant
woman. An abortion that violates the conditions described in the immediately
preceding sentence may be punished as a violation of R.C. §§ 2903.01 through

(R.C. § 2901.13(A)) ('81 Code § 130.06)
§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.
   (C)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   CULPABILITY means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence,
as defined in §
130.08.
      (4)   INTOXICATION includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(R.C. § 2901.21) ('81 Code § 130.07)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a
certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against
conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that
nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware
that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a
certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that
the circumstances probably exist.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely
to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is
reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that the circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a
certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with
respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he
fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for the element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose issue also
sufficient culpability for the element. When knowledge suffices to establish an
element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for the
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) ('81 Code § 130.08)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the
organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable,
such provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the
offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the
organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable,
such provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (B)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust, or other commercial or legal entity.
ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) ('81 Code § 130.09)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization as defined in §
130.09 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) ('81 Code § 130.10)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life, is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
(R.C. § 2923.02) ('81 Code § 130.11) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.11.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

      (1)   A violation of §§
133.02, 135.08, R.C. §§ 2903.01, 2903.02, 2905.01, 2907.02–2907.05, 2907.12, or
2911.11.
      (2)   A violation of R.C. § 2907.12 as it existed prior to September 3,
1996.
      (3)   An attempt to commit a violation of R.C. §§ 2907.02–2907.05 or to
commit a violation of R.C. § 2907.12 as it existed prior to September 3, 1996.
      (4)   A violation of any law that arose out of the same facts and
circumstances and same act as did a charge against the person of a violation of
R.C. §§ 2907.02–2907.05, that was previously dismissed or as did a charge
against the person of a violation of R.C. § 2907.12 as it existed prior to
September 3, 1996, that previously was dismissed..
      (5)   A violation of R.C. § 2905.02 that would have been a violation of
R.C. § 2905.04 as it existed prior to July 1, 1996, had it been committed prior
to that date.
      (6)   A sexually oriented offense, as defined in R.C. § 2950.01, if, in
relation to that offense, the offender has been adjudicated as being a sexual
predator, as defined in R.C. § 2950.01.
   (E)   The chief administrative officer of a jail, community-based
correctional facility, or other detention facility described in division (B) of

superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation gives
agencies in the criminal justice system, as defined in R.C. § 181.51, in the
state official notification that the state DNA laboratory is prepared to accept
DNA specimens.
(R.C. § 2901.07)
§ 130.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500, or
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 and unless another
term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court
imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to
impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall
impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under division
(C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a
jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the
following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (3)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator a longer time under
the same community control sanction if the total time under all of the
community control sanctions imposed on the violator does not exceed the five-
year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section or may impose on the
violator a more restrictive community control sanction or combination of
community control sanctions, including a jail term. If the court imposes a jail
term upon a violator pursuant to this division, the total time spent in jail
for the misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community
control sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the
offense for which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may
reduce the longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under
the longer sanction or the more restrictive sanction by all or part of the time
the violator successfully spent under the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   A term of up to 180 days in an alternative residential facility
or a term in an alternative residential facility not to exceed the longest jail
term available for the offense, whichever is shorter. The court may specify the
level of security in the alternative residential facility that is needed for
the offender.
      (2)   The court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative
residential facility, or other place at which the offender will serve the
residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the
operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place may cause the convicted offender to be examined and tested for
tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to,
hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The person in charge of
the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or
other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV
infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, or
another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (3)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(3) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction

offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. §§ 1716.14(A), 2913.01, 2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1)
or (B)(2), 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or
disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of
these offenses, is committed by the offender in the offender's same employment,
capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a
single offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61
(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. §§ 1716.14(A),
2913.02, 2913.03, 2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether

ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct,
all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are
tried as a single offense, the value of the property or services involved for

aggregate value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in
the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2921.41 is

offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2921.41 in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another as described in division (B)(1) or (B)(3) of this
section, or committed one or more theft offenses that involve a common course
of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as
described in division (B)(2) of this section.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing which has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or morally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

This section, formerly based on R.C. § 2907.07, was repealed because the
underlying misdemeanor offense (importuning – solicitation of a person of the
same sex to engage in sexual activity with the offender, when the offender
knows the solicitation is offensive to the other person, or is reckless in that
regard) was held unconstitutional in State v. Thompson, 767 N.E.2d 251 (Ohio
2002) (holding that the statute imposed an unconstitutional content-based
restriction on speech). For felony provisions, see R.C. § 2907.07(A), (C), (D)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the village are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to flood loss.
   (C)   Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for
promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its citizens.
(Ord. 518, passed 9-14-89; Am. Ord. 1994-O-14, passed 5-19-95; Am. Ord. 2001-O-
4, passed 1-11-01)
§ 150.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. 518, passed 9-14-89; Am. Ord. 1994-O-14, passed 5-19-95)
§ 150.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective
barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the START OF CONSTRUCTION of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of a HISTORIC STRUCTURE, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
      (3)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.

chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance
with its provisions.
(Ord. 518, passed 9-14-89; Am. Ord. 1995-O-14, passed 5-19-95)
§ 150.23 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ZONING INSPECTOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Zoning Inspector shall include but
are not limited to:
   (A)   Permit review.
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary permits
have been received from those federal, state or local government agencies from
which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by the Department
of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act.
      (3)   Review all development permit applications to determine if the
proposed development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are
delineated in the flood boundary and floodway map or the flood insurance rate
map of the flood insurance study. Floodways may also be delineated in other
sources of flood information. If the proposed development is located within a
designated floodway, the zoning inspector is to assure that the encroachment
provision of §
150.72 is met.
      (4)   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with §
150.06 are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Within these areas, the Zoning Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, including data obtained under § 150.071, in order to
administer §§
150.66 and
150.67.
   (C)   Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         (a)   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
         (b)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §
150.20(C)(3).
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter, including base flood elevation data, flood
insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps, variance
documentation, conditional letters of map revision, letters of map revision,
letters of map amendment, and as-built elevations.
   (D)   Alteration of watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered to be altered if any change occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in §
150.20(C)(4) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered
or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
   (E)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood election profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §§
150.35 and
150.36 of this chapter.
   (F)   Alteration of village boundaries. Upon occurrence, notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of the village have been modified by annexation
or the community has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority
to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area.
In order that the village’s flood insurance rate map accurately represent the
village’s boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
village suitable for reproduction, clearing delineating the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the village has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.

chapter.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Erie County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (D)   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and the following:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (D) above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
   (F)   The Zoning Inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.

§ 150.36 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCE.
   (A)   Variances may only be issued where due to physical characteristics of
the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this chapter do not constitute exceptional hardship.
   (B)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (D)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing §
150.35(D)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (F)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant;
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this ordinance,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in §
150.35(D), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
   (G)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

150.06 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in §
150.23(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, projectiles, and cause erosion. The following
provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (B)   If division (A) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of §§
150.65,
150.66,
150.67,
150.68 and/or
150.69.
   (C)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon prior approval by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by the Planning
Commission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2001-O-4, passed 1-11-01)
§ 150.73 AREAS WITHOUT FLOODWAYS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where the flood insurance study
provides base flood elevation data as set forth in §
150.06, but no floodways have been designated, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
   (B)   If division (B) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of §§
150.65,
150.66,
150.67,
150.68 and/or
150.69.
(Ord. 2001-O-4, passed 1-11-01)
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL
§ 150.80 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION CONTROL RULES.
   (A)   The Erie County Stormwater Management Rules, Regulations and Erosion
Control (a copy of which is attached to Ordinance 1995-0-36) are adopted and
fully incorporated herein, as the rules regulating drainage and abating erosion
within the village. Council designates the Erie County Engineer as the
enforcement administrator of the regulations.
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree and shall receive the penalty provided by law. Each day a violation
continues to exist may be considered a separate offense.
(Ord. 1995-O-36, passed 11-18-95)
§ 150.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any
person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions of and safeguards established
in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be fined or
imprisoned as provided by the laws of the village. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violations. The village shall prosecute any violation
of this chapter in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

degree than that experienced by the development site in its predevelopment
stage, unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety.
      (4)   All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that
adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a
result of such developments. More specifically:
         (a)   No development may be constructed or maintained so that such
development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water.
         (b)   No development may be constructed or maintained so that surface
waters from such development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto
lower adjacent properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause
substantial damage to such lower adjacent properties.

   (A)   Subcollector, local and minor residential streets shall be curved
whenever practicable to the extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot
appearance.
   (B)   Cul-de-sacs and loop streets are encouraged so that through traffic on
residential streets is minimized. Similarly, to the extent practicable,
driveway access to collector streets shall be minimized to facilitate the free
flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.
   (C)   Residential driveway access shall not be permitted to regional, major
or secondary thoroughfares as designated on the major thoroughfare plan and the
comprehensive plan for major subdivisions.
   (D)   Half streets (i.e. streets of less than the full required right-of-way
and pavement width) shall not be permitted except where such streets, when
combined with a similar street (developed previously or simultaneously) on
property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a street that meets
the right-of- way and pavement requirements.
   (E)   Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed
1,000 feet, unless no other practicable alternative is available.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.068 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is unsuitable
for subdivision development considering but not limited to flooding, poor
drainage, topography, soils, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal,
transportation facilities, and other such conditions which may endanger health,
life, or property and, if from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned it is determined that in the best interest of the public the land
should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not
approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced by the
subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the development of
the land.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.069 STREET DESIGN.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction, and location
of all streets shall conform to the major thoroughfare plan. All streets shall
be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of the land to
be served by such streets. The circulation pattern shall discourage through
traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The subdivider shall provide, within
the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the necessary right- of-way for the
widening, continuance, or alignment of such streets in conformity with the
Major Thoroughfare Plan. The Commission reserves the right to disapprove any
street plan which does not insure continuity of existing street systems.

Residential streets             100
 
   (B)   A minimum tangent of at least 100 feet shall be provided between
reversed curves on all residential streets; greater tangential lengths shall be
required on collector and arterial streets and other higher order
thoroughfares.
   (C)   The Commission may modify the aforementioned minimum standards in the
following situations:
      (1)   When a collector or residential street's lines deflect from each
other at any point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve
with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet or
with such greater radius as the Commission may deem necessary for the
particular situation.
      (2)   For arterial streets, curves with radii adequate to insure longer
sight distances may be required by the Commission.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.073 VERTICAL ALIGNMENT.

§ 151.074 INTERSECTION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles
as topography or other limiting factors will permit.
   (B)   No intersection of streets at angles less than 60 degrees shall be
approved unless justified by extreme topographical conditions. In such a case,
special provisions as deemed necessary by the Commission shall be made in
designing the intersection to afford a satisfactory sighting of approaching
vehicles from each intersecting street.
   (C)   Residential street intersections shall be rounded with a 30 foot
radius measured at the back of curbs, if such intersections occur at right
angles. Under the same condition and measured similarly, all other
intersections shall be founded with a radius deemed appropriate by the
Commission. If an intersection at an angle less than 60 degrees is unavoidable,
the radius of curvature shall be such as to allow vehicles, especially trucks
and buses, to make right turns and proceed in the proper lane without crossing
the centerline of a two-lane thoroughfare.
   (D)   Street jogs at intersections with centerline offsets shall be avoided.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.075 SPECIAL STREET TYPES.
   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   (A)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. A “dead-end street”
as used in this chapter shall mean a street with only one outlet. Temporary
dead-end streets shall be permitted only as a segment of a continuing street
plan subject to extension into undeveloped acreage. Temporary dead-end streets
shall extend to the boundary of such undeveloped acreage and shall be provided
with an interim turnaround satisfactory to the Commission in design. The
Commission shall reserve the right to limit the length of such a dead-end
street based on principles of proper planning, and the Commission may require a
street along the boundary between a proposed subdivision and the undeveloped
acreage to provide for future development.
   (B)   The dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. If a parcel
to be subdivided exists adjacent to a dedicated or platted and recorded half-
width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley falling
within the proposed subdivision shall be platted, providing that in the opinion
of the Commission such right-of-way is necessary for the proper development of
the area.
   (C)   Easements or reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where deemed necessary by the Commission and where their
control is definitely placed with the Village.
   (D)   In subdividing land along existing streets or roads and within a
proposed subdivision, provisions for the dedication of land for one or more
access streets to undeveloped land not fronting on an existing street or road

seeded.
   (J)   The channel downstream of the subdivision shall be improved adequately
by the developer to convey the storm runoff from the subdivision and across the
adjacent property owner so that damages from flooding are minimized. Property
lines shall be so designed as to follow drainage easements, except that such
easements may cross lots larger than one acre.
   (K)   No water course shall be altered in such a way as to change the amount
of direction of flow; no fill, building or structures shall be situated in
natural water courses unless provision is made for the flow of water in a
manner satisfactory to the County Engineer.

subdivision be conveyed to the village for park purposes. In lieu of the
conveyance for park purposes, the Commission may in conjunction with the
village require the subdivider to pay $100 per lot created by the subdivision
to be used for improvements to park land in the village. Upon the sale of the
first lot within the subdivision, the subdivider shall pay the village $500 for
the first five lots. The above shall be repeated for each group of five lots or
part thereof. If less than five lots are to be developed, the amount to be paid
shall be $100 per lot for the total number of lots less than five.
   (C)   Where a large scale subdivision or planned unit development is
proposed, the Commission may require that consideration be given to sites for
parks, playgrounds, and other such areas for common use and that provisions be
made for such reservation or acquisition by the proper agency.
   (D)   The commission may reserve the right to deny approval to a subdivision
if such a subdivision disregards the preservation of natural features which add
value to residential development and the community, such as wooded areas, water
courses, beaches, areas of natural or historical significance and similar
irreplaceable assets as described in the comprehensive plan.

following arrangements:
   (A)   Performance bond. The subdivider may post a bond executed by a surety
company equal to the estimated cost plus 10% of the required improvements. The
bond shall be in favor of the Village Council. The bond shall guarantee

officials.
   (C)   Contract documents or escrow agreements. Where contract documents or
escrow agreements for the proposed improvements are available, copies of such
contracts shall be certified to the Village Council and when approved will
constitute sufficient guarantee for the installation of required improvements

period as required by the conditions or guarantees as outlined above, the
Village Council may proceed to have such work completed and reimburse itself
for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit, certified check, surety
bond, or by drawing upon the letter of credit, or shall take the necessary
steps to require performance by the bonding company.

FLOOD PLAIN REGULATIONS
§ 151.155 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   In order to protect the public's health, safety and general welfare
and to become a participant in the regular program of the Federal Flood
Insurance Program, the Village Council passed a Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance,
Chapter 150 of this Title. The Ordinance and the following will be required by
the Commission for new subdivisions.
   (B)   The Commission shall:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit the subdivision of lands for uses which are
dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood or which, with
reasonably anticipated improvements, will cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that each subdivision lot in an area vulnerable to floods
be provided with a safe building site with adequate access and that public
facilities which serve such uses be installed with protection against flood
damage at the time of construction; and
      (3)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision of
unprotected flood hazard lands, requiring that flood hazard areas be delineated
on all plats, and reserving through deed restrictions areas not suitable for
development.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.156 FLOOD PLAIN EVALUATION.
   (A)   The primary source of information that will be used by the Commission
in determining the flood hazard potential of an area is the Flood Boundary
Maps. These maps were prepared by the Federal Flood Insurance Administration.
   (B)   A proposed subdivision will be located on the maps and its flooding
potential determined. Restrictions on the types of uses within a portion or the
entire proposed subdivision will be noted and must be followed. The Commission
will meet with the subdivider to evaluate the degree and extent of the flood-
prone areas within the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.157 FLOOD PLAIN REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the other requirements set forth in these requirements, the

areas:
   (A)   The Flood Boundary areas shall be clearly labeled on both the
preliminary and final plat;
   (B)   Building sites may be permitted in the Flood Boundary area if the
sites are filled or if the first habitable floor or the structure is elevated
above the 100 year elevation of the area. The 100 year flood elevation will be
stated on both the preliminary and final plats.
   (C)   Fill areas shall extend beyond the limits of the intended building
site and shall include areas for proper drainage and slope.
   (D)   The County Board of Health shall determine if adequate methods for
waste disposal and water supply can be accomplished for each building site.
Where such systems will not function properly, the Commission will not approve
the subdivision.
   (E)   The County Engineer shall determine the street elevations in flood
hazard areas and state what drainage systems will be required for the
subdivision.
(Ord. 537, passed 7-19-90)
§ 151.158 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter shall be considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas
outside the delineated flood hazard areas or land uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of Erie County or the village or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

§ 151.173 VARIANCES.
   The following regulations shall govern the granting of variances:
   (A)   Where the Commission finds that unnecessary hardship may result from
strict compliance with this chapter, due to exceptional topographic or other
physical conditions, it may vary the regulations so as to relieve such
hardship, provided such relief may be granted without detriment to the public
interest and without impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter or the
desirable development of the neighborhood and community. Such variations shall
not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter, the
comprehensive plan, or a zoning ordinance.

such conditions as will, in its judgement, secure substantially the objective
of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.

setting forth the reasons which justify said variance.
   (D)   A fee, as specified in §

§ 8. SAMPLE SUBDIVIDER'S AGREEMENT.
This Agreement, executed on this      day of                             , 19
     , by and between (name of developer) the Subdivider, as evidenced by the
Plat and the Kelleys Island Council of Erie County, Ohio, is governed by the
following conditions and considerations, to wit:
Said subdivider shall cause no private construction of permanent buildings to
be made on the lands within such plat until street construction is started with
the approval of the County Engineer and all applicable permits are obtained. No
house may be occupied until all improvements are accepted unless otherwise
allowed by the County Engineer, Kelleys Island Council and Health Department.
Said subdivider shall construct, install or otherwise make all improvements
shown and set forth to be done and performed by the engineering drawings and
specifications, all of which are a part of this agreement. The subdivider shall
pay the entire cost and expense of the required improvements.
Prior to County Engineer and the Mayor's signatures on the final plat, the
subdivider shall execute a performance surety equal to 110% of the estimated
cost of the public improvements (street, storm sewer, sanitary sewer and water
lines and appurtenances) to the satisfaction of the Kelleys Island Council to
insure the faithful performance of this agreement. The subdivider shall also
deposit with the Erie County Engineer and the Village Council the sum of money
estimated to be necessary to pay the cost of inspection. Should the amount of
such deposit be insufficient to pay the cost thereof, the subdivider shall
immediately, upon demand deposit such additional sums as are estimated by the
Engineers to be necessary. Upon completion and acceptance of the improvement,
any unexpended balance remaining from such deposit or deposits shall be
refunded. (All checks may be made payable to the Village Clerk of Erie County,
Ohio).
The subdivider shall hold Erie County, the Kelleys Island Planning Commission,
Board of Public Affairs, Planning Commission Review Board, Village Council,
Planning Commission Board of Appeals and the Erie County Engineer free and
harmless from any and all claims for damages of every nature arising or growing
out of the construction of such improvements, and shall defend, at his or their
own cost and expense, each and every lawsuit brought against said Erie County,
the Erie County Commissioners and the Erie County Engineer by reason thereof
until the improvement has been accepted by the County Engineer, the Village
Council and the Erie County Commissioners.
All work is to be performed within a period of two years from the date of this
agreement, which is hereby fixed by said County as a reasonable period, but an
extension of time may be granted if approved by the Village.
The subdivider further agrees that any violation of noncompliance with any of
the provisions and stipulations of this agreement shall constitute a breach of
contract and the Erie County Engineer, with the approval of the Kelleys Island
Village Council shall have the right to stop the work forthwith and use the
surety to complete the work.
This agreement shall be binding on the subdivider and his or her personal
representatives, heirs and assigns.
In consideration whereof, the Kelleys Island Council hereby grants the
subdivider or his agent the right and privilege to make the improvement
stipulated herein.

§ 152.008 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the aforesaid
districts as shown on the zoning districts map, the following rules shall
apply:
   (A)   Where boundaries approximately follow streets, alleys, or highways.
Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
center line of alleys, or the center line of right-of- way lines of highways,
such lines shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
   (B)   Where boundaries parallel street lines, alley lines or highway right-
of-way lines. Where zoning district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, the
center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the center lines of right-of-way
lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being
parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map.
If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the
scale shown on the zoning map.
   (C)   Where boundaries approximately follow lot lines. Where zoning district
boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be said boundaries.
   (D)   Vacation of public ways. Whenever any street, alley, or other public
way is vacated in the manner authorized by law, the zoning district adjoining
each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended
to the center of such vacated public way, and all areas included in the
vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the
extended districts.
(Ord. 1993-0-2, passed 3-13-93)
§ 152.009 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Zoning permits required. No building or other structure shall be
erected, moved, demolished, added to, structurally altered, nor shall any
building, structure, or land change in use without a permit therefore, issued
by the Zoning Inspector in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
The term CHANGE IN USE refers to any change in the use of a structure or parcel
of land. The terms BUILDINGS OR OTHER STRUCTURES are intended to include (but
are not necessarily limited to): fences, swimming pools, temporary free
standing signs, along with any structure considered temporary. Nor shall any
house or structure included in the historical inventory be demolished without
obtaining a permit.
   (B)   Required yards and other open spaces. No part of a yard or other open
space required about any building for the purpose of complying with the
provisions of this chapter shall be included as a part of a yard or other open
space similarly required for another building.
   (C)   Structure in yards. No structure shall be erected in any required yard
except those which are an integral part of off-street parking facilities.
(Ord. 1993-0-2, passed 3-13-93)
§ 152.010 SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Health Department approval required. Due to unique soil conditions and
in order to protect the health and safety of area residents, all applicants for
a zoning permit involving structures with sewer facilities, must show evidence
that an application to the Erie County Health Department, or Ohio EPA (as the
case may be in terms of jurisdiction) has been made for a sewage disposal
system approval. Prior to the issuance of a zoning permit, satisfactory
evidence that a proposed sewage disposal system has been approved by the Ohio
EPA, or Erie County Health Department, must be shown.
   (B)   Minimum lot sizes. Unless otherwise specified within a particular
zoning district, the minimum lot area shall be 15,000 square feet and the
minimum lot width at the minimum setback line shall not be less than 100 feet.
   (C)   Additional yard and buffering requirements.
      (1)   Yard requirements and buffering between residential and commercial
or park and recreational land uses. To secure a desirable transition between
residential and commercial land uses, additional requirements shall apply to
side and/or rear yards beyond those requirements specified in the zoning
districts. For parcels of land which are zoned General Commercial (C-2), or
Park and Recreational (PR), and which abut a residential or agricultural zoning
district, the minimum side and/or rear yards abutting such residentially zoned
land shall be a minimum of 100 feet. For parcels of land which are zoned
Central Business (C-1), and which abut a residential or agricultural zoning
district, the minimum side and/or rear yards abutting such residentially zoned
land shall be a minimum of 25 feet. These side and/or rear yards shall not
contain any signs or parking areas of any kind, and shall have plantings of
trees and/or shrubs which will have a minimum height of 4½ feet and will
provide an opacity of 100% in the summer and 50% in the winter within three
years. Existing vegetation shall be used to fulfill this requirement where
feasible and all plant material shall be maintained in an attractive condition.
      (2)   Other yard requirements and buffering requirements. To secure a
desirable transition between residential and land uses permitted in Industrial
or Quarrying Zoning Districts, additional requirements shall apply to side and/
or rear yards beyond those requirements specified in the zoning districts. For
parcels of land which are zoned Industrial or Quarrying (I or Q), and which
abut a residential zoning district, the minimum side and/or rear yards abutting
such residentially zoned land shall be a minimum of 100 feet. These side and/or
rear yards shall not contain any signs or parking areas of any kind, and shall
have plantings of trees and/or shrubs which will have a minimum height of 4½
feet and will provide an opacity of 100% in the summer and 50% in the winter
within three years. Existing vegetation shall be used to fulfill this
requirement where feasible and all plant material shall be maintained in an
attractive condition.
      (3)   Adjustments to front yard requirements. Whenever 50% or more of the
lots along any one street or the lake shore have been developed prior to the
adoption of Ord. 1996-O-2, the minimum front yard requirement may be reduced to
an average setback for all structures located along the subject street or the
lake shore within a distance of 400 feet on either side of the property in
question. The structure shall be placed perpendicular to the lot lines or in a
manner that is harmonious to the adjoining structures within 400 feet on either
side of the subject property.
      (4)   Adjustments to side yard requirements for corner lots. Regardless
of side setback line requirements and minimum side yard requirements set forth
in other parts of this code, when a lot is located on a corner of intersecting
streets, rights-of-way, or a street and the lake shore, all yards abutting a
street or right-of-way shall be considered to be a front yard, and shall be
required to have front yard setbacks and front yard requirements for all such
yards abutting a street or right-of-way. In the event a street intersects the
lake shore, the yards facing the street and the yard facing the lake shore
shall be deemed to be a front yard. In any event, the remaining yards shall be
deemed to be side yards and shall meet the minimum side yard setbacks.
      (5)   Visibility at intersections. On any corner lot in the village, no
building, structure, object, fence or landscaping of any nature, except utility
poles and traffic control devices, shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed
to grow in such a manner as to impede vision three feet above the centerline
grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the street lines of
such corner lots and a line joining points along said street lines 50 feet from
the point of intersection.
      (6)   Fences, walls and hedges.
         (a)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, fences, walls
and hedges may be permitted in any required yard or along the edge of any yard
provided that no fence, wall or hedge along the sides or front edge of any
front yard shall be over 4½ feet in height.
         (b)   In the Agricultural, Park and Recreation, and all of the
Residential Zoning Districts, no fence shall be in excess of 6½ feet in height
as measured from the finished grade of the lot in the rear and side yards. In
the Park and Recreation and all of the Residential Zoning Districts, where a
property line adjoins any Commercial, Manufacturing or Quarry Zoning District,
no fence shall be in excess of eight feet in height as measured from the
finished grade of the lot in the rear and side yards along that adjoining
property line.
         (c)   Permits for garden fences that meet the definition set forth in
this chapter may be issued for garden fences in excess of 6½ feet in height.
         (d)   Storage of materials of any sort, or the placement of buildings
along the lot line does not constitute either a fence or a wall. In addition,
the storage of junk, defined in §
152.004, along the lot line does not constitute either a fence or wall, and the
storage thereof is expressly prohibited herein.
         (e)   In all Commercial and Manufacturing Zoning Districts and the
Quarry Zoning District, no rear or side yard fence shall exceed eight feet in
height.
         (f)   Residents are strongly encouraged to speak with neighbors
regarding plans to build a fence prior to submitting an application for a
zoning permit and shall place the finished side of the fence towards the
neighboring property.
      (7)   Private swimming pools. No swimming pool shall be allowed in any
Agricultural or Residential District except as an accessory use and unless it
complies with the following conditions and requirements:
         (a)   The pool is intended for the use of the occupants of the
property on which the pool is located;
         (b)   The pool and accessory structures such as walks, paved areas,
and fences shall not be located closer than 15 feet to any property line and
shall be a minimum of ten feet from the principal building; and
         (c)   The swimming pool, or the entire property on which it is located
shall be so walled or fenced so as to prevent uncontrolled access from the
street or adjacent properties. Said fence or wall shall not be less than four
feet in height and maintained in good condition, with a gate and lock. Such
walls or fences are similarly required regardless of whether the pool is an
above ground pool.
      (8)   Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting, when used for security,
landscaping, or signage shall be so designed and directed so as not to
adversely impact adjacent property.
      (9)   Accessory structures.
         (a)   Accessory structures (when not attached to a principal
structure) shall not be located within ten feet of any property line.
Additional setback requirements can be located in each zoning district and in §
152.010(C)(1) and (2).
         (b)   Accessory structures (when not attached to a principal
structure) may not be located in an area that would place it closer to the
street than the principal structure, except where the accessory structure is to
be located on a lot that has more than 50 feet of frontage adjacent to Lake
Erie.
         (c)   Where an accessory structure is attached to a principal
structure in a substantial manner, such as a room having walls, permanent
floor, and a roof, such accessory structure shall be considered part of the
principal structure providing all the required setbacks can be met.
         (d)   Additional requirements for accessory structures located within
the shoreline zoning district are located in §§
152.130, et seq. The permit fee for these types of structures shall be
established by Council from time to time.
         (e)   Accessory structures are not considered dwellings and the change
from an accessory structure to living area requires a change of use permit.
Accessory structures shall not be converted into living areas unless a change
of use permit is obtained. In addition, an applicant proposing to change an
accessory structure into living area must also obtain and provide to the zoning
inspector an approval from the Erie County General Health District relative to
the approval of the onsite sewage disposal system.
      (10)   Decks, landings and walkways. Decks, landings and walkways less
than 80 square feet shall be subject to the permit provisions of §§
152.060 through
152.067 of this chapter, and shall be subject to the basic fee for said permit.
Any and all decks, landings and walkways in excess of 80 square feet shall be
charged the basic permit fee plus the per foot fee as established from time to
time by Council. This provision does not apply to walks or driveways on grade.
      (11)   No person shall develop more than 25% of the surface area of any
building lot as follows: no more than 10% of a building lot shall be utilized
for the principal residence, no more than 10% of the building lot shall be
utilized for any outbuilding, including decks, and no more than 5% of any
building lot shall be paved.
   (D)   Building on the lake shore. That area of land which begins at the mean
low water edge and whose opposite boundary is the road right-of-way closest to
the lake, shall not be used for the building of any structure which would
obscure the view of the lake. If the depth of the area is such so as to permit
the erection of a structure so that the highest point, chimney included, would
not exceed four feet above the level of the road, such a structure, or boat
house, may be erected, subject however, to the approval of the Planning
Commission. The structure must be set back 3 feet from the road right-of-way,
or the road surface, on the lake side of the road only. Planting of shade
trees, properly trimmed and spaced are not forbidden, providing it has the
approval of the Planning Commission.
   (E)   Building on the shore line of Lake Erie surrounding Kelleys Island
where Lake Shore Drive has not been extended or where there is no road at
present. Before an application for the building of a structure may be made,
complete plans and survey of the property must be submitted for the approval of
the Planning Commission. The setback from the high water mark will be at a
minimum of 125 feet with the following exception: a structure may be built
within the 125-feet setback of the high water mark if any point of the
structure or outbuilding is a minimum of 125 feet from any side yard lot line.

routine maintenance, no existing sign of any type may be modified, changed or
altered in any way except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
Whenever a nonconforming sign is damaged or partially destroyed for any reason,
such that more than half of the value is lost, then such a sign may not be
reconstructed and placed in the same location without being made to be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Provisions for optional increases in maximum sign area. Within any
zoning district, the maximum allowed sign area may be increased by up to 1½
times provided that the village Design Review Board determines that the
characteristics of a proposed sign are in keeping with the historic and
architectural characteristics of the village. Such characteristics include the
proposed type styles, colors, associated pictures or images, materials from
which the sign is made, and proposed location of such sign. The Design Review
Board shall prepare and make available guidelines for desired sign
characteristics.
   (F)   Exempted signs. The following types of signs do not require a zoning

street) shall also be provided to illustrate area traffic movement. This site
plan shall also contain a place for the signature of the Chairperson of the
Planning Commission to indicate approval of the site plan in accordance with
the requirements of this division.
   (C)   Plan review. Within 31 days following the submission of a site plan
which the Zoning Inspector has found to be complete with respect to the
requirements herein, the Planning Commission shall hold a public meeting to
consider such plan, and act to approve, disapprove or modify such plan. In
conducting its review, the Planning Commission shall consider issues such as
traffic safety, pedestrian movement, convenience of access, impacts on adjacent
land uses, and general public safety and welfare issues, and determine that the
standards described in §
152.048(C) are complied with. The Planning Commission, may if circumstances
warrant, further limit the number of driveways into or out of a development to
maintain better traffic flow on the public street, require additional
buffering, or yard requirements, to maintain a better separation of pedestrian
and traffic movement, and may require greater building setbacks to achieve more
desirable and safer pedestrian and traffic movement. As a condition of
approval, the Planning Commission may, as circumstances warrant, require a bond
or letter of credit to guarantee completion of the improvements as shown on the
site plan. Alternatively, the occupancy permit(s) for a new building may not be
granted until all improvements shown on a site plan are made.
§ 152.017 EXCAVATION.
   (A)   In areas outside a (Q) Quarrying zoning district, whenever any
blasting is involved in the excavation of any type of bedrock, or whenever the
excavation of more than 50 cubic yards of sand, gravel, rock, or soil is
involved as part of a building construction project, multi-structure
development project, or a non-structural improvement such as pond construction,
a landscaping project, or marina construction, an excavation permit shall first
be obtained, in addition to any other zoning permits required in this chapter.
This 50 cubic yard limitation refers to an annual amount of excavated material
being removed from a single property (whether on a single lot or parcel, or two
or more contiguous lots or parcels). To obtain an excavation permit, an
excavation plan shall be prepared and submitted along with a bond or other
acceptable from of financial guarantee to the village before such work may
begin. The plan submitted shall illustrate the area to be excavated, the time
frames for such excavation, and plans for the restoration of the property. All
non-construction areas excavated and not to be built on, shall be restored to
provide a vegetated slope that does not exceed one foot vertical for every
three feet horizontal. The amount of the bond or other financial guarantee to
the village shall be $500 unless a greater amount is specified by the Zoning
Inspector as a result of unusual circumstances.
   (B)   Within areas which are zoned (Q) Quarrying, excavation activity is
regulated in accordance with the standards prescribed therein, and state
statutes as applicable.

set forth in this chapter; but no such amendment shall become effective unless
the ordinance proposing the amendment shall first be submitted in writing by

of the hearing thereon shall be given to such owners. The notice shall include
a statement that opportunity will be afforded to any person interested to be
heard. All applications for a zoning change shall include:
      (1)   Evidence that the existing zoning ordinance is unreasonable with
respect to the particular property, and it deprives the property owner of his
lawful and reasonable use of the land; and/or
      (2)   Evidence that the proposed amendment would materialize in an equal
or better zoning ordinance than that existing.
      (3)   For purposes of this chapter, a limitation upon financial gain from
the land in question shall not constitute unreasonable zoning.
   (B)   Any person or persons desiring an amendment of the zoning map shall
pay all costs incurred by the Planning Commission and the village in connection
with the application for amendment including, but not limited to legal fees,
costs of notices, advertising, and secretarial charges. As described in §

or persons, shall be barred from making application for the same amendment for
the period of one year, unless the application contains substantial changes in
the use of the real property at issue and/or the scope of the proposed
amendment.

generally positive, but concern exists over increasing land use conflicts
between commercial and residential property. In order to accommodate this
expansion, and minimize impacts on adjacent property, this C-1 (T) Central
Business transitional district is established to provide a means to help ensure
that expansion of the Central Business District will occur in a more orderly
and controlled fashion and with minimal negative impacts and consequences to
adjacent residential property.
   (B)   Permitted uses. In the C-1 (T) Zoning District, the following uses are

§ 152.037 C-2 (T) TRANSITIONAL GENERAL COMMERCIAL.
   (A)   Purpose. Like the C-1(T) Zoning District, the C-2(T) district is
established because the village had observed that there is pressure for an
outward expansion of the general business district into adjacent residential
areas. This trend is considered to be generally positive, but concern exists
over increasing land use conflicts between commercial and residential property.
There are areas in the village where expansion of general commercial activities
into adjacent residential areas is likely and desirable provided that
conversion of residential structures and new commercial construction occurs
with minimal impact to any adjacent residential property. Therefore, in order
to accommodate this expansion, and minimize impacts on adjacent residential
property, this C-2(T) General Commercial Transitional District is established
to provide a means to help ensure that expansion of the General Commercial
District will occur in a more orderly and controlled fashion and with minimal
negative impacts and consequences to adjacent residential property.
   (B)   Permitted uses. In the C-2 (T) Zoning District, the following uses are

must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or single entity, and must
be at least ten continuous acres in size.
   (C)   Permitted and conditional uses. A developer may propose to include any
mixture of land uses which are listed as being permitted or conditionally
permitted in any zoning district (except for Industrial and Quarrying), with
the following limitations: The proposed location of commercial uses shall not
have an adverse impact upon adjacent property or the public health, safety, and
morals. Not more than 35% of the gross acres in a proposed development may be
devoted to commercial uses. Further, not more than 25% of the gross acres in a
proposed development may be devoted to dwellings which are not detached single-
family dwellings.
   (D)   Development standards. The following standards represent broad
parameters under which all PUD developments must be designed:
      (1)   Central water and sewer facilities. All developments approved as a
PUD must have central water facilities approved by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency or be served by public water and sewer facilities.
      (2)   Clustering residential development and density. Clustering
residential development is encouraged to provide required common open space.
Overall, the area devoted to residential land uses shall have a maximum overall
density of three dwelling units per acre of land (net acres, excluding roads).
This overall density may however, be clustered in particular areas of the
development to a level of up to ten dwelling units per net acre in any given
area, provided however, that no less than 40% of the site is devoted to useful
and desirable common open space established to provide recreational
opportunities and to preserve unique environmental features on the site.
      (3)   Maximum impervious surface. For all areas proposed for residential
uses in the development the amount of impervious surface proposed must not
exceed 50% of the total developed residential area. For all areas proposed for
commercial uses in the development, the amount of impervious surface proposed
must not exceed 75% of the total commercial area. Impervious surfaces include
but are not limited to, parking areas, loading areas, and roof tops.
      (4)   Development layout and design. Specific residential density as well
as the development intensity of non-residential uses and the development design
and layout shall be based on the applicant's ability to provide sufficient
evidence to the Planning Commission and the Village Council that the overall
development demonstrates excellence in design by properly considering:
significant natural and historic features, topography, natural drainage
patterns, roadway access and circulation, surrounding land uses, the
enhancement of the general welfare of the public, and aesthetically desirable
land development. Attractive landscaped buffers shall be provided between
incompatible land use and activities.
      (5)   Front, side and rear setback standards for perimeter lots. All lots
which are located along the perimeter of the PUD shall have minimum front, side
and rear setbacks equal to those which would normally be specified in the
applicable conventional zoning district for the particular land use.
      (6)   Common space. A minimum of 40% of the gross acres developed in the
PUD shall be reserved for common open space for the residents of the area. This
required amount of common space shall be established as open space forever and
provisions shall be established for maintenance and care. The legal articles
relating to any organization of property owners in the development charged with
such open space maintenance is subject to review and approval by the village.
The Village Planning Commission and/or Village Council may require as a
condition of final approval, any evidence deemed necessary to document that the
required common space will remain in its stated condition forever (including
such legal documents as deed restrictions, conservation easements, etc.).
      (7)   Front, side, and rear setback standards for interior lots. Within
the PUD, the standards for setbacks shall be fully described in the proposed
preliminary and final development plan submitted in accordance with the
requirements of this section.
      (8)   Off-street parking and loading facilities. For all land uses
located within the PUD, the parking and loading standards contained in §
152.048 shall be applied.
   (E)   General PUD approval procedure. The applicant for a PUD must submit
both a preliminary plan and a final development plan. Property must also be
rezoned to PUD and the decision to approve a final development plan and to
rezone a property PUD are done concurrently. The final development plan,
together with all conditions, stipulations, and requirements become the zoning
requirements for that particular property. All development restrictions
described in the final development plan and supporting documents become the
official zoning requirements of the subject property.
   (F)   Preliminary development plan submission. The applicant shall submit
ten copies of a proposed preliminary plan to the Zoning Inspector along with
the required application fee. The proposed preliminary development plan shall
include the following:
      (1)   Background information.
         (a)   Name, address and phone of the applicant;
         (b)   Name and address of the registered surveyor, engineer and/or
landscape architect who prepared the plan;
         (c)   Legal description of the property;
         (d)   Description of the present use of the property;
         (e)   A statement of the conceptual overview of the development;
         (f)   A description of the proposed provision of utilities;
         (g)   A description of proposed ownership and maintenance of open
spaces;
         (h)   A description of the expected timing of the development;
         (i)   A list of property owners within 500 feet of the proposed
development; and
         (j)   An archeological survey of the property prepared by an
appropriate professional;
      (2)   Plan drawing.
         (a)   A vicinity map;
         (b)   A table showing the gross acreage devoted to various uses;
         (c)   Location, type and density of development types;
         (d)   Conceptual drainage plan;
         (e)   Location of open spaces;
         (f)   Buffers between incompatible land uses;
         (g)   Proposed street layout;
         (h)   Existing buildings, and any existing potential underground
storage tanks; and
         (i)   Overlay maps showing topography in two foot increments (derived
from field survey or aerial photography), and soil types.
      (3)   Additional information and fees. The Village Planning Commission
may require additional information such as maps, data, or reports including
environmental impact studies. The applicant shall be responsible for all
reasonable expenses incurred by the village in reviewing the preliminary and
final development plans or any modifications thereof. Such expenses are in
addition to the application fees established by Village Council and may include
professional service fees such as legal fees and the fees for the services of
other professionals such as geologists, landscape architects, planners,
engineers, environmental scientists, or architects, incurred in connection with
reviewing the plans and prepared reports.
   (G)   Preliminary plan review. Within 30 days following the submission of
the required information, a public hearing shall be scheduled on the proposed
plan. Notice of this hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least 15 days prior to such hearing. Notice of this hearing
shall also be sent to all property owners within 500 feet of the proposed
development.
   (H)   Preliminary development plan review as a subdivision. Concurrently,
with the PUD review procedure described herein, all PUD developments must also
be reviewed as a subdivision pursuant to §§
151.140 and
151.141 of the Subdivision Regulations. Where possible, reviews and hearings
will be held concurrently in order to facilitate timely action on proposed
developments. Whenever the requirements of this section conflict with
requirements contained in the Subdivision Regulations, the stricter of the two
shall apply.
   (I)   Criteria for approval of a preliminary development plan. Within 20
days following the public hearing referenced in division (H) above, the Village
Planning Commission shall act to approve, disapprove or conditionally approve
the preliminary plan in accordance with the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the Kelleys Island Port Master Plan, a copy of which is available
for inspection at the Village Clerk's office;
      (2)   That the benefits, improved arrangement, and the design of the
proposed development justify the deviation from standard development
requirements included in this chapter;
      (3)   That the uses requested in the proposal are compatible with
surrounding land uses;
      (4)   That there are adequate public services (e.g. utilities, fire
protection, emergency service, etc.) available to serve the proposed
development;
      (5)   That the proposed development will not create overcrowding or
traffic hazards on existing roads or intersections;
      (6)   That the arrangement of land uses on the site properly consider
topography, significant natural features, natural drainage patterns, views, and
roadway access;
      (7)   That the clustering of development sites are shown to preserve any
natural or historic features and provide usable common open space;
      (8)   That the proposed road circulation system is integrated and
coordinated to include a hierarchical interconnection of interior roads as well
as adequate outer-connection of interior collector streets with off-site road
systems;
      (9)   That there are adequate buffers between incompatible land uses;
      (10)   That the Village Planning Commission is satisfied that the
developer possesses the requisite financial resources to begin the project
within the required one year and complete the project within three years or
within the phasing schedule;
   (J)   Effect of approval of the preliminary development plan. The Planning
Commission approval of a preliminary plan will be considered an approval of the
preliminary development plan in principle only. Approval of the preliminary
plan does not, therefore, approve any development on the site nor shall it be
construed to absolutely endorse a precise location of uses, configuration of
parcels, or engineering feasibility. Approval of the preliminary development
plan is necessary however, before the applicant may submit a final development
plan to the Planning Commission and Village Council for approval and rezoning
to PUD.
   (K)   Final plan. The applicant shall submit ten copies of the proposed
final plan to the Village Zoning Inspector along with the required application
fee. The final plan shall include the following:
      (1)   All of the written information required for the preliminary plan
application (see division (F) above) revised as necessary and:
         (a)   The specific description of permitted, conditionally permitted
and
accessory uses to be allowed in each area of the development;
         (b)   A copy of proposed deed restrictions;
      (2)   In addition to the information provided on the preliminary plan,
the final plan shall be drawn to scale (1" to 100') and include:
         (a)   A survey of the proposed development site, showing dimensions
and bearings of the property lines; area in acres; topography; and existing
features of the development site, including major wooded areas, streets,
easements, utility lines, and land uses;
         (b)   The location and dimensions of all lots, setbacks, and building
envelopes, as well as those of any primary and secondary leaching field
envelopes;
         (c)   Engineering drawings and plans of sewer and water facilities as
well as street and drainage systems;
         (d)   Landscaping plan for all buffers and other common areas;
         (e)   Architectural guidelines to apply throughout the development;
         (f)   The proposed names of all interior streets proposed for the
development; and
         (g)   Layout and dimensions of all parking and loading areas along
with an indication of what they are to be built to serve.
   (L)   Final plan and rezoning approval procedure process. The decision to
rezone land to PUD and to approve the final plan are technically separate
decisions. However, in order to provide for the efficient and timely processing
of both the rezoning request and the request for final plan approval, all PUD
final plan submittals are deemed to be an application for amendment to the
Zoning Code in accordance with §§
152.100 through
152.109. All procedures (Planning Commission review, public hearing, and final
action by Council), therein shall be followed in considering an application for
a rezoning of the land in question to PUD. Upon approval of such application to
rezone the property in question to PUD, the zoning districts map of the village
shall be amended to designate the project area as “PUD.” Thereafter, with the
concurrent approval of the rezoning and final plan pursuant to the criteria
stated in division (M) below, all development restrictions and conditions
described in the final plan shall become official requirements of the PUD.
   (M)   Criteria of approval - final plan. The Planning Commission and the
Village Council shall review the proposed final plan in accordance with the
following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the Kelleys Island Port Master Plan;
      (2)   That the proposed development advances the general health, safety
and morals of the village;
      (3)   That the Planning Commission and Village Council are satisfied that
the developer posses the requisite financial resources to begin the project
within the required one year and complete the project within three years or
within the phasing schedule;
      (4)   That the interior road system, proposed parking, and any off-site
improvements are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic generated
by and within the proposed development;
      (5)   That any exception from standard district requirements can be
warranted by design and other amenities incorporated in the final development
plan, in accordance with these PUD requirements;
      (6)   That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned
in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
and
      (7)   That the existing and proposed utilities, including water and sewer
service, and drainage plan will be adequate for the population densities and
non-residential uses proposed in the PUD.

Chapter 151
§ 152.042 HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY ZONE.
   (A)   Purpose. The village government recognizes the unique history of the
Island and recognizes that the distinctive history and atmosphere of the
village is firmly grounded in the Islands's physical development and
architecture. Because of this distinctive environment, the village declares it
to be a matter of public policy to help preserve, protect and enhance the
overall historic character of the village by discouraging new development or
alterations of existing buildings which are determined to be detrimental to,
and incompatible with the existing architecture, physical form and historic
atmosphere of the village. Hence this historic district overlay zone is created
to apply to certain areas of the village which exhibit unique and distinctive
architecture, the significance of which could be seriously undermined by
dissimilar and incompatible new construction. This overlay zone is intended to
encourage the reuse of older and historically valuable structures, and it is
also recognized that beyond cultural benefits, the protection of historical
resources on the Island will further the economic development of the area
through tourism, and will help maintain and improve property values as well as
overall health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the residents of the village.
   (B)   Creation of an historic district overlay zone. There is hereby created
an Historic District Overlay Zoning District. This district imposes additional
requirements beyond those of the underlying zoning district in order to further
the purposes stated above.
   (C)   Certificate of appropriateness required. Before any new structure is
built, or before any existing structure is altered such that the foundation or
roof line is altered, or any porches, decks or breezeways are enclosed, or any
windows are removed or replaced, a certificate of appropriateness is required.
Additionally, before any sign, fence, or parking area, is constructed, altered
or otherwise modified, a certificate of appropriateness is required.
   (D)   Establishment of a design review board. There is hereby established a
Design Review Board which shall have the authority to issue a certificate of
appropriateness to those persons who, upon proper application, desire to make
any changes other than ordinary maintenance to any structure, objects or
property, real or otherwise, within an Historic District Overlay Zone. The
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness within the Historic District
Overlay Zone is required before issuance of a zoning permit by the Zoning
Inspector.
   (E)   Composition and organization of the design review board.
      (1)   The Design Review Board shall be composed of six members, all
citizens of the village with the Zoning Inspector sitting in as an ex-officio
member. These six people shall be appointed by the Mayor, and they shall
include representation as follows: Three members shall be residents of the area
included in the Overlay Zone and shall be locally regarded as being
exceptionally knowledgeable of village history, one member shall be a member of
the Planning Commission, one member shall be a member of the Village Council,
and one member shall have a background in architecture, construction, or real
estate. The terms of the membership shall be staggered such that the initial
appointments include two persons with a one year term, two persons with a two
year term, and two persons with a three year term. Appointments following these
initial terms shall all be for three years.
      (2)   All meetings of the Board shall be public meetings, with prior
public notification. Four members shall constitute a quorum, and a majority
vote of those present at meeting shall be necessary to pass any motion. The
Board shall meet at least four times a year. In the event of a tie vote, the
Zoning Inspector shall be called upon to cast a deciding vote.
   (F)   Duties of the design review board. The Design Review Board shall have
the following duties in addition to those otherwise specified in this section:
      (1)   The Board may conduct surveys or otherwise assemble information
related to all areas, places, buildings, structures, homes, works of art or
other objects of environmental, architectural and aesthetic interest in the
village.
      (2)   The Board shall work for the continuing education of the residents
of the village with respect to the architectural and historic heritage of the
Island.
      (3)   The Board is hereby authorized to issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness upon application therefor. When a certificate of
appropriateness is granted, it shall be directed to the Zoning Inspector who
may issue a zoning permit provided all other sections of this code are complied
with and shall precede the issuance of a permit.
      (4)   The Board shall decide upon an application for a certificate of
appropriateness within 31 days following submission of such application, unless
an extension is requested by the applicant. The Board may exercise authority to
conditionally approve an application with modifications to the plan.
      (5)   In considering the appropriateness of any application, the Board
shall take into account, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the
historical and architectural style and general design, arrangement, texture and
material of the proposed change, as they relate to the property in its present
condition, and shall also consider the relation thereof to the same or related
factors in other properties, objects and areas in the immediate vicinity.
Additionally, for rehabilitation of existing structures, the Board shall
consider the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. These
standards (published in 36 CFR Part 67, Historic Preservation Certifications)
are to be applied to rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner taking into
account economic and technical feasibility.
      (6)   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall include
both a verbal description of the proposed activity along with plans providing
sufficient detail to describe and accurately reflect the proposed construction
activity. Additionally, photos, drawings, and sketches which also help describe
the proposed activity shall also be submitted if available.
      (7)   The Design Review Board shall review all requests made for
demolition permits as described in §
152.062(F). In reviewing such requests, the Board shall explore alternatives to
the demolition.
      (8)   The Design Review Board shall review requests for additional sign
area pursuant to §
152.011(E).
   (G)   Procedures. In carrying out its functions, the Design Review Board
shall meet as required, but not less than four times per year. The Board shall
initially establish a statement of procedures which shall govern its meetings.
Such procedures shall be printed and made available to all who seek to be
guided in their presentations to the Board.
   (H)   Appeals. An applicant who has been denied a certificate of
appropriateness by the Design Review Board may appeal the decision to the
Village Council. Any such appeal shall be made within 30 days after the
complaint of action or inaction of the Board. Upon hearing such an appeal,
Village Council may reverse, affirm or modify the order or determination. To
reverse a decision made by the Board, the Village Council must find clear
evidence that the actions proposed by the applicant are consistent with the
Village of Kelleys Island Port Master Plan.
   (I)   Standards for issuing cenijicate of appropriateness. Upon application
for a certificate of appropriateness, the Design Review Board shall utilize the
following standards in determining whether to issue a certificate of
appropriateness.
      (1)   Overall specifications.
         (a)   While house styles may vary on Kelleys Island, a narrow frame,
two or three bays wide is the most typical. A one and one-half to two and one-
half stories high house, with a front gable roof pitch (slant) of 1217 to 12/12
is commonly seen. The set back is approximately 25 to 50 feet from the road.
The windows and doors conform to the general verticality of the house. The
rectangular T or L plan, with a wooden porch on the front or just off to the
side, is also characteristic.
         (b)   Most houses have small wings or additions on the sides or rear.
These are smaller and lower than the main part of the building, with shed or
hipped roofs.
         (c)   Kelleys Island's few historic commercial buildings have been
primarily frame, set close to the street, and one or two stories high.
      (2)   Guidelines.
         (a)   Existing Buildings and Landscaping:
            1.    Roofs.
               a.   The original roofline should be maintained, and the
original character of the roof covering preserved as much as possible. Dormers,
or small skylights, may be added, preferably not in the front roof slope.
               b.   Gable and shed roofs are preferred. Dormers, if added,
should be kept small, and placed on the rear or sides, where least visible.
            2.   Lighting. Subdued lighting, congruent with the character of
the structure or neighborhood, is encouraged. Exterior lighting, including
commercial signage, will be reviewed.
            3.   Paint Colors. Paint colors should reflect the historic period
of the structure and will be reviewed individually.
            4.   Landscaping. The use of plants indigenous to the Island is
encouraged. Trees over 12 inches in diameter (at three feet above ground),
located in the historic district and fronting on a village street, should be
preserved unless diseased or a hazard to the community.
            5.   Demolition. The following guidelines provide a checklist for
reference, before demolishing a structure or ruin:
               a.   Structures and ruins on the National Register Inventory
should not be demolished.
               b.   Section
152.062 of this code requires procurement of a demolition permit from the
Zoning Inspector and reviewed by the Design Review Board.
               c.   Prior to demolition, the future use and appearance of the
site must be approved.
               d.   All sides of the structure, along with interiors and
setting, should be documented photographically and placed on file with the
Design Review Board.
               e.   Exterior and interior elements should be salvaged from the
building and offered for sale or donation to Island residents.
      (2)   New Construction.
         (a)   Protection of Kelleys Island Historic District Overlay Zone does
not exclude new construction, but encourages new buildings that are compatible
with its historic and visual characteristics. The intent of an Historic Area is
not to "freeze" an area in time, but rather to encourage new buildings which
allow for changing needs and tastes. New construction includes both additions
and in-fill buildings.
         (b)   New buildings should be compatible with the historic and
architectural character of the area yet should also be recognized as products
of their own time. The height, details, setbacks, lot width, window shape and
position, door placement, general rhythm, and predominant materials should be
considered when designing an in-fill structure. By taking its cues from its
neighbors, the new building can be made to fit into the broad visual pattern of
its historic area.
         (c)   The following criteria are all important in considering whether
new construction proposed for the historic area is compatible:
            1.   Height. New construction should be of similar height to that
of adjacent buildings.
            2.   Proportions. This is the relationship between the width and
height of a building: tall and narrow, low and squat, square. New construction
should employ proportions similar to those of adjacent buildings.
            3.   Relationship to Street. A new building should reflect adjacent
structures in its orientation and placement in relation to the street, and
reflect the setback of the existing streetscape.
            4.   Prehab Houses. The use of prefab houses in an historic
district should be discouraged. Effort should be made by the builder owner to
select options for windows, doors, roof type and slant, and materials that are
in harmony with the neighboring buildings in shape, line and size.
            5.   Siding. The original siding should be preserved, where
possible, or replaced with like material. Replacement siding should reflect the
original exterior of the house or building. Wood siding is preferred, brick or
cement block discouraged.
            6.   Porches. Ideally, the original porches should be maintained.
If deteriorated, porches should be replaced with elements which match the
original in material and appearance. Porches and decks will be reviewed
individually by the Board.
            7.   Windows.
               a.   Architecturally significant windows should not be altered.
When replacement is necessary, however, one should match the sash configuration
(number of panes) and the width of sash elements as closely as possible. One
should use wood, preferably, or vinyl-clad wood.
               b.   New window openings should be of the same proportions, and
new sash of the same configuration, as those originally on the building.
               c.   Shutters, when closed, should be wide enough to cover the
window opening.
               d.   Storm windows, installed on the outside, are preferred to
thermal-pane glass replacement windows.
            8.   Doors. Original doors should be repaired, when possible. If
replacement is needed, use similarly-paneled doors and original material. Storm
and screen doors should be wood, the screens and storms covering no more than a
third of the door. Cross buck aluminum designs should not be used.
            9.    Decorative Elements.
               a.   Since historic decoration and millwork reflect the history
of Kelleys Island, all decorative elements should be kept and maintained. If
deteriorated, repair or replace with similar materials.
               b.   Decoration should not be added unless there is physical or
photographic evidence that it previously existed. If added, its design should
reflect the era of the original structure.
            10.   Fences and Walls. Old fences should be kept and maintained.
Chain link or solid wooden fences in front yard setback are discouraged.
            11.   Outbuildings. Outbuildings that reflect the history of the
Island should be kept and maintained even if they no longer serve their
original purpose.
            12.   Additions.
               a.   Bays, porches, and other additions to the front facade
should be in keeping with the character of the house and reflect its historical
antecedents.
               b.   Additions to existing houses should be subordinated to the
original structure, comprising no more than 50% of the original square footage
unless otherwise demonstrably in keeping with the character of existing houses.
            13. Existing Ruins.
               a.   Archaeological sites listed on the National Register
nomination should be kept and maintained.
               b.   The presence of prehistoric or historic archaeological
sites or ruins should be determined' before excavating for new construction,
and possible ways of avoiding and protecting them presented.
            14.   Parking Areas. Parking areas should be laid out in the rear
of the lot. Concrete and asphalt driveways and parking lots are discouraged.
            15.   Awnings. Awnings should be of cloth or wood.
            16.   Handicap Ramps. Handicap ramps should not be constructed on
front facades or entirely replace original porches, and should be designed for
eventual dismantling.
            17.   Roofs. New construction should reflect the predominant roof
shapes in the area. Roof pitches should be similar to that which currently
exists. Gabled and hipped roofs of asphalt shingles and metal standing seam are
appropriate forms and materials.
            18.   Siding. New construction should reflect the historic
materials, textures and colors which exist, including painted wood, natural
stone, pressed metal. Brick was not used in Kelleys Island historic houses and
should be discouraged. Appropriate siding would include clapboard or shiplap.
            19.   Porches. Porches on new construction should be encouraged and
should be built on primary or street facades, and should maintain the rhythm
and placement of porches of adjacent structures.
            20.   Windows. The size and proportion of window openings should be
similar to those on surrounding facades. They should not exceed the height and
width ratios of adjacent buildings by more than 10%. Storm windows, installed
on the outside are preferred to thermal-pane glass. Shutters, when closed,
should be wide enough to cover the window openings. Windows should be 1/1 sash.
            21.   Doors. Entrances should have simple, paneled doors. Storm and
screen doors should be wood or wood-like material. The screen and storms should
cover no more than a third of the door. Cross buck aluminum designs should not
be used.
            22.   Decorative Elements. The architectural details of new
buildings should relate to that of existing buildings. Such details may include
lintels, cornices, arches, chimneys and ironwork. Overly simplified new
buildings with no detail should be avoided in areas where rich detailing and
ornamentation are common characteristics.
            23.   Landscaping. The use of plants indigenous to the Island is
encouraged. Trees over 12 inches in diameter (at three feet above ground),
located in the historic district and fronting on a village street, should be
preserved unless diseased or a hazard to the conununity.
            24.   Paint Colors. Paint colors should reflect the historic period
of the structure and will be reviewed individually.
            25.   Fences and Walls. New fences and walls should be modeled
after those found on the Island. Fences should be kept low, preferable three
feet high in front, and should be 50% open.
            26.   Outbuildings. Garages, storage sheds and other new
outbuildings should be located in the rear yard, preferably on an axis with the
house. Conunercial buildings should have their filtration plants in the rear of
their business and surrounded by a fence. Swinuning pools should also be
located at the rear of the side rear and fenced.
            27.   Archaeological sites. Prior to excavation for new
construction, the presence of prehistoric or historical archaeological sites
and ruins should be determined and every effort should be taken to avoid and
protect them.
            28.   Reconunendations for Additions.
               a.   Scale the addition to the size of the original building.
               b.   Use contemporary design for the new addition so that it
blends with, but does not duplicate, the style of the original structure.
               c.   Select materials and colors that are compatible with the
historic building, i.e wood or stone. Avoid rough-sawn siding, artificial
stone, or other materials which would not have been used in the historic area.
               d.   Avoid roof-top additions. Skylights may be added, but their
placement should be at the rear of the building.
            29.   Signage. Signs throughout Kelleys Island are regulated
through §
152.011 of this code. These regulations detail appropriate types, sizes and
locations for signs and must be followed in order to receive a sign permit.
These general regulations are contained in §
152.011 of this code and there are regulations for signs and each zoning
district which should also be consulted and obeyed.

§ 152.043 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. Being one of a very small number of islands in the state, the
village government recognizes the uniqueness of the natural environment on the
island and also recognizes that steps must be taken to ensure that uncontrolled
development and unplanned development does not destroy important elements of
the natural environment which residents cherish and treasure.
   (B)   Creation of an Environmental Protection Overlay District.  
      (1)   There is hereby created an Environmental Protection Overlay
District. This district imposes additional requirements beyond those of the
underlying zoning district in order to protect significant island environmental
features and generally further the purposes stated above. This overlay zone is
intended to apply to shoreline areas of the island where intensive development
in terms of density, building location, building heights and vegetation removal
could destroy scenic vistas along the lake shore. This overlay zone is also
intended to apply to other unique environmental features such as wetlands,
flood hazard areas, erosion hazard areas, unique plant and animal habitats and
archeological sites.
      (2)   The Environmental Protection Overlay District shall be defined as
being those areas of the village 125 feet from the natural shoreline or as
otherwise designated on the EPOD map as adopted by Council. This area shall be
designated as an overlay zoning district over any and all of the underlying
zoning districts relative to all of the land 125 feet from the natural
shoreline as it is defined in §
152.004 of this chapter.
   (C)   General requirements. Any new construction of any structure, or
alteration of any existing structure shall not take place until a site plan has
been prepared and approved in accordance with the requirements herein. A site
plan is not required when a property simply changes use without any physical
modification to any buildings or any new construction taking place. Such a site
plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission which has the authority to
require additional building setbacks, a more restrictive height limitation in
order to preserve views and scenic vistas, a limitation on the amount of trees,
or other vegetation that may be removed from the site or specific erosion
control measures.
   (D)   Site plan requirements. Before the Zoning Inspector may issue a zoning
permit for a proposed new structure or alteration of an existing structure
within the Environmental Protection Overlay District, a site plan of the
subject property must be prepared and submitted to the Planning Commission for
review and must be approved. This site plan shall consist of a scale drawing,
showing or otherwise describing, the following:
      (1)   The location of all existing and proposed buildings, including
building heights, and setbacks, parking areas and driveways, and accessory
buildings;
      (2)   Show or otherwise describe, all significant environmental features
on the site, including, but not limited to: all trees greater than ten inches
in circumference; any wetlands; identified archeological sites; identified
erosion hazard areas as identified by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Geological Survey; known location of habitats for rare, threatened
or endangered species as identified by the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service. (It is recommended that both the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service be contacted in order to obtain
recommendations from both governmental entities relative to any development
plan within the Environmental Protection Overlay District.) Densely vegetated
areas may be illustrated as an area and described as a unit;
      (3)   A description of how the applicant has taken steps to preserve and
protect the identified unique environmental features on the site in the
development of the construction plans, including but not limited to the
incorporation of any recommendations from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and/or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service relative to
erosion hazard areas and the protection of habitats for rare, threatened or
endangered species respectively; and
      (4)   Both the Planning Commission and the applicant are encouraged to
refer to the Village of Kelleys Island Port Master Plan for information and
guidance with respect to environmental issues and concerns. The Kelleys Island
Port Master Plan is available for inspection at the office of the Village
Clerk.
   (E)   Plan review.
      (1)   Within 31 days following the submission of a site plan which the
Zoning Inspector has found to be complete with respect to all of the
requirements herein, the Planning Commission shall hold a public meeting to
consider such plan, and act to approve, disapprove, or modify such plan. In
considering the plan, the Planning Commission shall try to balance the goals of
preserving and protecting unique and valuable environmental assets of the
Island with the property owner’s rights and to achieve a reasonable use of the
property.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may require an alternative arrangement of
buildings, structures, setbacks, yard dimensions, or other requirements as set
forth in the underlying zoning district, and may also require site specific
buffer zones, tree or habitat preservation, erosion control practices, or
similar measures to protect unique environmental features.
   (F)   Appeals. An applicant who has been denied approval of a proposed site
plan may appeal such a decision to the Village Council, who will act as an
administrative appellate body. Any such appeal shall be made within 30 days
following the decision of the Planning Commission. Upon hearing such appeal,
Council may reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the Planning Commission.
In order to reverse a decision made by the Planning Commission, the Village
Council must find clear and convincing evidence that the actions proposed by
the applicant are consistent with the Village of Kelleys Island Port Master
Plan as it relates to the proposed development.
   (G)   The revised "Environmental Protection Overlay District Zoning District
Map of the Village of Kelleys Island, Ohio" as submitted by the Planning
Commission, is adopted as part and parcel of this section. A copy of said
"Environmental Protection Overlay District Zoning District Map of the Village
of Kelleys Island, Ohio" is attached to Ordinance No. 2001-O-3, passed January
11, 2001, and expressly incorporated by reference herein and is on file at the
Office of the Clerk of Council for public inspection. Furthermore, the Mayor
and the members of Council are hereby authorized and directed to execute the
aforementioned map as part of the Official Zoning Districts Map of the Village
of Kelleys Island, Ohio. In addition, any and all previous versions of the
"Environmental Protection Overlay Zoning District Map of the Village of Kelleys
Island, Ohio" are hereby repealed and replaced with the within map and the
attachments thereto.

      (7)   The applicant shall submit the regular fee for an Application for
Zoning Permit, plus the fee for a conditional use permit. In the event there is
a building or other structure required to be built as part of an application
for a wireless telecommunications facility, the regular square footage fee
shall also be submitted in addition to the fee for the Application for Zoning
Permit fee and the conditional use application fee.
      (8)   Upon approval, the applicant must post a bond and have
comprehensive liability insurance as set forth below in division (F) below.
   (G)   Maintenance; abandonment.  
      (1)   The wireless telecommunications facility shall be maintained and
kept in good order and repair and in compliance with all applicable federal and
state requirements and the ordinances of the village.
      (2)   The telecommunications provider shall agree to remove the proposed
telecommunications facilities (and any associated site improvements such as
access drives) within 180 days of discontinued use of or the failure to use
them, and to return the entire site to its prior state, at the sole cost of the
provider. Upon such discontinued use or failure to use, and if such
telecommunications facilities are not removed as set forth above, it shall be
conclusively presumed to be abandoned, and the permits to use them shall be
terminated. At any time thereafter, the Council or its authorized designee,
shall give written notice to the provider that it intends to remove such
telecommunications facilities (and related site improvements) at the provider’s
cost, no sooner than 90 days after receipt by the applicant of said notice.
Within that 90 day period, the provider shall be given the opportunity to
either reactivate, or activate such telecommunications facilities, remove them
together with any and all site improvements, and to return the site to its
prior state, or in the alternative, the provider shall show good cause why the
telecommunications facilities (and related site improvements) should not be
removed and the site returned to its prior state, at the provider’s cost.
      (3)   In order to cover Council’s costs of such removal upon the
occurrence of such events, the provider shall post a bond or submit to escrow a
cash deposit in an amount equal to $100 per vertical foot of any
telecommunications tower or attachment, plus the sum of $100 per linear foot of
any or all access drives to the property. This bond or cash deposit shall be
submitted to the Clerk of Council and be made payable to the Village of Kelleys
Island, Ohio, prior to the granting of any permit under this section.
Furthermore, the provider shall insure that the bond remains in full force and
effect, or the deposit shall remain in escrow, as the case may be, until such
telecommunications facilities are removed in accordance with this legislation.
Failure to keep the bond in effect or failure to keep funds in escrow will
subject the provider to revocation of its conditional use permit upon
notification and after 30 days to cure the deficiency. Furthermore, the
provider shall indemnify and hold harmless the village, its officers, and
employees from any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred on
account of or resulting from the construction, operation, maintenance, or
removal or the proposed telecommunications facilities. The provider shall
provide proof of insurance in the following types and amounts insuring the
village: comprehensive general liability insurance with limits of not less
than: $1,000,000 for bodily injury or death to each person; $1,000,000 for
property damage resulting from any one incident; and $3,000,000 in the
aggregate.
   (H)   Map. The Wireless Telecommunication Facilities Overlay District shall
be delineated on a separate zoning map, which is adopted as part of this
section and is attached to Ordinance No. 2001-O-15, passed May 10, 2001 and
expressly incorporated by reference herein. Any amendments to the Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities Overlay District will be considered an amendment

§ 152.047 NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to provide for the continuation of uses
and structures that do not conform to this existing Zoning Code, but were
lawfully existing at the time of enactment of this chapter.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses. The lawful use of any building or land existing at
the effective date of Ord. 1993-0-2 may be continued although such use does not
conform with the provisions of this chapter, provided the following condition
are met:
      (1)   Alterations. A nonconforming building or structure may not be
altered, improved or- reconstructed, enlarged or extended, except as outlined
in division (C) below.
      (2)   Nonconforming to nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be
changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed nonconforming
use is in less conflict with character and use of the district than the
existing nonconforming use as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Construction approved prior to ordinance. Nothing in this chapter
shall prohibit the completion of construction and use of nonconforming building
for which a zoning certificate has been issued prior to the effective date of
Ord. 1993-0-2, provided that construction is commenced within 90 days after the

without interruption for a continuous period in excess of 30 days; and that the
entire building shall have been completed within one year after the issuance of
said zoning certificate.
      (4)   Displacement. No nonconforming use shall be extended to displace a
conforming use.
      (5)   Discontinuance or abandonment. Whenever a nonconforming use has
been discontinued for a period of two years or more, such discontinuance shall
be conclusive evidence of an intention to abandon legally the nonconforming
use. At the end of that two-year period of abandonment the nonconforming use
shall not be re-established, and any further use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter.
      (6)   Unsafe structures. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any portion of a building or
structure declared unsafe by a proper authority provided such work is not to an
extent exceeding in aggregate cost 50% of the replacement value of the building
or structure, unless the building or structure is changed to a conforming use.
      (7)   Annual review of nonconforming uses. Each year, the Zoning
Inspector shall make an inspection of known nonconforming uses, and shall keep
records describing the activities taking place on the property, as well as the
conditions of the structure.
   (C)   Nonconforming structures. A structure which was lawfully constructed
before the effective date of Ord. 1993-0-2, and which is nonconforming with
respect to height, or setbacks from any lot lines, may be continued, provided
however, that if such structure is to be altered, expanded, enlarged or
otherwise structurally modified, such alteration, or enlargement, shall not
increase the amount of nonconformity with this chapter. For example, a building
which has a side yard of five feet in a Zoning District which requires a ten-
foot side yard, may not be enlarged upon so that the side of the building
abutting such non-conforming side yard is increased in length, unless any new
additions are built in conformity with the greater side yard requirement.
   (D)   Nonconforming lots. Whenever a parcel of land exists which is
nonconforming as to required lot size, then such lot may be built upon
individually. However, where an individual, group of individuals, corporation,
or other organization owns two or more lots abutting each other in such a way
as to permit compliance with the lot size requirements of this chapter, then
such lots shall be combined to functionally represent a single building lot to
the extent that is necessary to comply with the requirements of this chapter.

§ 152.062 TYPES OF ZONING PERMITS.
   Eight types of zoning permits may be issued when activity is found to be in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. These eight types of zoning
permits are:
   (A)   Construction permit. Before any structure, as defined in this chapter
is built, erected, enlarged, or placed on a property, a construction permit is
required. The Zoning Inspector shall issue such a construction permit when he
or she is satisfied that according to the information submitted by the
applicant, the proposed structure will conform with all requirements of this
code. Such permits shall be displayed on the subject property until
construction is completed.
   (B)   Occupancy permit. Following the construction of any new structure,
occupancy of the new structure for any purpose shall not take place unless and
until an occupancy permit is issued by the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning
Inspector shall issue such an occupancy permit when he or she is satisfied that
the proposed structure was constructed in accordance with the plans and other
information previously submitted, and that the use for which the property is
stated to be used for and is about to be placed conforms with the requirements
of this chapter.
   (C)   Use permit. When no new construction or alteration of an existing
structure is involved, and when the use of a property or structure changes, a
use permit is required. The Zoning Inspector shall issue such a use permit when
he or she is satisfied that, according to the information submitted by the
applicant, such change of use does conform to the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Certificates of appropriateness. As described in §
152.042, when any property is located within an Historic District Overlay Zone,
a certificate of appropriateness is required in many circumstances involving
construction or alteration of a structure. These certificates are approved by
the Design Review Board and are required prior to the issuance of any other
permit by the Zoning Inspector.
   (E)   Conditional use permit. As described in §
152.086, the Planning Commission has the authority to issue a conditional use
permit. Such permits authorize one particular use with or without specific
conditions required by the Planning Commission.
   (F)   Demolition permit. Before any structure may be demolished, a
demolition permit must first be obtained from the Zoning Inspector. For areas
which are located within the Historic District Overlay Zone, applications for a
demolition permit shall be reviewed by the Design Review Board in accordance
with §
152.042(F)(7), and may be granted provided that the Design Review Board is
satisfied that such grant will conform with the requirements of this chapter.
   (G)   Sign permit. Before any sign, except those exempted in §
152.011(F), may be placed, constructed, or structurally altered, on or attached
to a building, or on a parcel of land, a sign permit is required. Such permit
may be authorized by the Zoning Inspector provided that the Zoning Inspector is
satisfied that such grant will conform with the requirements of this chapter.
   (H)   Excavation permit. As described in §
152.017, in areas outside a (Q) Quarrying Zoning District, whenever any
blasting is involved in the excavation of any type of bedrock, or whenever the
excavation of more than 50 cubic yards of sand, gravel, rock, or soil is
involved as part of a building construction project, multi-structure
development project, or a non-structural improvement such as pond construction,
a landscaping project, or marina construction, an excavation permit shall first
be obtained from the Zoning Inspector provided that the requirements of §
152.017 have been met.

discretion of the Zoning Inspector a new legal description and/or survey would
better assist him in the enforcement of this chapter relative to the issuance

shall issue the appropriate zoning permit if the application complies with the
requirements of this chapter and the application is accompanied by the proper
fee as indicated in §
152.066.
   (C)   No person shall move any building (including modular homes) over,
along, or across any highway, street, or alley in the village, without first
obtaining a permit to do so from the Village Administrator. If the move
requires a road closure, the applicant shall submit a permit fee of $50 with
the application.
   (D)   (1)   Any person seeking issuance of a permit to move a building
(including modular homes) shall file an application for a permit with the

and Maintenance Department of the dates the modular home or building will be
transported and installed in the village. If road closures are required, the
zoning permit holder will notify the Village Administrator ten days prior to
the modular home or building being transported and installed in the village.

property owner, all improvements to the land cannot be made as shown on the
plans submitted for a zoning permit, such as parking lot landscaping, parking
lot paving, sidewalk construction, park improvements, tree plantings, or other
such improvements, an occupancy permit may still be issued provided a
completion bond, letter of credit, or other form of security is posted with the
village to guarantee the completion of such improvements. All such guarantees
shall be reviewed by the legal counsel for the village, and estimated cost for
completion of the involved improvements shall be estimated by a third party
approved by the Mayor. Any costs associated with developing such an estimate
shall be paid for by the applicant, and the specific terms and conditions
prescribed in the bonds or other security instruments shall be determined by
the Village Zoning Inspector and legal counsel for the village.

(Ord. 1993-O-2, passed 3-13-93)
§ 152.086 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (A)   Within most zoning districts there are conditional uses which are uses
which may be acceptable within a particular zoning district in certain
circumstances and with certain limitations. To provide necessary control over
the location of such uses, the Planning Commission shall review applications
for conditional uses. The review of proposed conditional uses shall be approved
or denied on an individual basis using the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed use will not, under the specific circumstances,
be detrimental or otherwise disturb surrounding property or the community as a
whole; and
      (2)   That the proposed use will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter.
   (B)   In making its decision, the Planning Commission may approve the
location of the conditional use with stipulations, and specific requirements.
Such requirements might include additional buffering at one location, no
illumination of signs, greater setbacks for specific areas, screening of
parking facilities, etc.
   (C)   Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit, the
zoning department shall prepare a list of property owners that are within 500
feet of the property in question, who shall be notified by first class mail 14
days in advance of the Planning Commission meeting during which the proposed
conditional use application will be considered.
   (D)   All conditional use permits shall authorize one particular conditional
use and such permit shall expire if such use is not commenced within one year,
or if such use is discontinued for more than two consecutive years.
   (E)   All conditional uses shall be subject to an annual review by the
Zoning Inspector. Such an annual review shall involve an examination of the
property to an extent necessary for the Zoning Inspector to determine that the
property, and the uses thereon, comply with the requirements of this chapter as
well as any conditions or restrictions placed on the property when the
conditional use was approved. In accordance with §
152.066, a fee shall be charged for this annual review and that the Zoning
Inspector be paid $25 for each annual inspection of conditional use properties.

public input relative to such uses, the Planning Commission shall review
applications for similar uses. The review of proposed similar uses shall be
approved or denied on an individual basis using the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed use is similar to one of the enumerated permitted
uses within the zoning district; and
      (2)   That the proposed use will not be detrimental or otherwise disturb
surrounding property or the community as a whole; and
      (3)   That the proposed use will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter.

§ 152.106 POWERS, DUTIES AND LIMITATIONS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals is granted the power and responsibility to hear
and decide the following matters:
   (A)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide upon all matters
relating to the interpretation of the requirements of this chapter. This shall
include matters of interpretation of the text of this chapter as well as
boundaries of zoning districts as they appear on the zoning map, and except as
noted in §
152.042 of this chapter, for cases involving architectural style and general
design. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall be mindful of the indicated purposes
and intent of all requirements within this chapter when interpreting the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear requests for variances to allow
deviation from the strict application of the dimensional requirements within a
given zoning district. In no case shall the granting of a variance allow any
type of change of use. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall only have the
authority to hear and decide upon requests for variances from measurable
development requirements such as yard dimensions, height limitations, lot
sizes, number of parking spaces required, etc. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
only grant such variances when it finds that the following circumstances are
true:
Specifically, the standards the Board of Zoning Appeals will apply to an
application for an area variance, i.e., seeking relief from the strict letter
of area, height, setback and other similar requirements contained in the
ordinance, to determine whether there are practical difficulties as follows:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (i.e. water, sewer, refuse disposal, etc.);
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with the
knowledge of the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament can be feasibly obviated
through some method other than a variance; and
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance. (See Duncan
v. Middlefield (1986) 23 Ohio St. 3d 83)
   (C)   After any variance is approved by the BZA, the person who has been
granted said variance must act on such variance within nine months and if said
variance requires construction, said construction shall commence not more than
nine months after said approval or such approval shall be deemed revoked by the
BZA.
   (D)   All persons denied approval on variance requests shall be precluded
from reapplying for same or similar variance for a period of not less than
three months.

disruptions to efficient pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The village may
require the service provider to use and employ the village police force for
traffic control; and
         (l)   Such other and further information as may reasonably be
requested by the village.
      (3)   The village, by and through its Planning Commission, shall grant or
deny, in writing, a person's application for consent to occupy or use the
public right-of-way within 60 days of the date on which the person filed the
application and all necessary information with the village.
         (a)   The village may withhold, deny or delay its consent to a
person's application to occupy or use the public right-of-way based on the
health, safety and welfare of the village and in accordance with village
ordinances and Ohio Law. These reasons may include but not be limited to those
criteria set forth in division (D) of this section. If the village denies a
person's application to occupy or use the public right-of-way, the village
shall provide its reasons in writing for denying the application, and shall
provide any information that the person may reasonably request necessary for
the person to obtain the village's consent to occupy or use the public right-

public right-of-way shall be in the form of a right-of-way occupancy
certificate which shall set forth the specific terms of the village's consent
for such person to occupy or use the public right-of-way.
      (5)   Each person submitting an application for consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way shall pay a fee in the amount of $250 per site and
assessed by the Zoning Inspector to reimburse the village for its
administrative costs.
      (6)   A person seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one small cell facility or one wireless support structure may file a
consolidated application for consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way
for up to 30 small cell facilities in a single application or up to 30 wireless
support structure requests in a single application. Said single application may
only address multiple small cell facilities or multiple wireless support
structures if they each involve substantially the same type of small cell
facilities or substantially the same type of wireless support structures. The
village may separately address small cell facilities or wireless support
structures for which incomplete information has been received or which are
denied. In the case of a single application, each small cell facility or
wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified or collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent to occupy or
use the public right-of-way for purposes of tolling the response deadline set
forth in this chapter.
      (7)   The time periods set forth herein may be tolled:
         (a)   By mutual agreement between the person requesting consent and
the village;
         (b)   Where the village determines that the application is incomplete;
or
         (c)   By the village in the event it receives applications for at
least 25 small cell facilities or wireless support structures contained in
pending requests, in which case the village may toll the 90 day period for up
to 21 days.
      (8)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the village shall
provide written notice to the person requesting consent not later than 30 days
after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all missing
documents or information.
      (9)   The time period resumes when the person makes a supplemental
submission in response to the village's notice of incompleteness.
      (10)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the village shall
notify the person.
   (D)   Small cell facility in public right-of-way. No person shall occupy or
use the public right-of-way as a small cell facility on a wireless support
structure without first obtaining the approval of the proposed improvements by
the Planning Commission. The person proposing the improvements shall deliver to
the Planning Commission nine sets of the plans and specifications including all
necessary details, profiles, and cross-sections for each proposed improvement.
The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove of such proposed
improvements based on the following standards:
      (1)   Compliance with all village codes and laws and other governmental
laws where required;
      (2)   The recommendation of all administrative departments in regard to
the improvements;
      (3)   The effect of the proposed improvements on the right-of-way and in
relation to all other improvements already installed or approved;
      (4)   The proposed location of the improvements in regard to such items
as sightlines, drainage, safety, and visual interference;
      (5)   The size, bulk, and location of the improvements in relation to
obtaining proper light, air, privacy, usable open space, and compatibility with
surrounding uses;
      (6)   The proper screening or placement of the improvements to minimize
the negative effects of the improvements on the right-of-way or adjoining uses;
and
      (7)   Compliance with the United States Department of Transportation
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and Ohio Department of
Transportation Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (OMUTCD).
   (E)   Service provider insurance. As a condition of the consent to occupy or
use the public right-of-way, a service provider must secure and maintain, at a
minimum, the following liability insurance policies insuring both the service
provider and the village as additional insured:
      (1)   Comprehensive general liability insurance with limits not less
than:
         (a)   One million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, $2,000,000
annual aggregate, for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   One million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, $2,000,000
annual aggregate, for property damage resulting from one accident; and
         (c)   One million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, $2,000,000
annual aggregate, for all other types of liability.
      (2)   The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be
maintained by the service provider throughout the period of time during which
the service provider is occupying or using the public right-of-way, or is
engaged in the removal of its facilities. Each such insurance policy shall
contain the following endorsement "It is hereby understood and agreed that this
policy may not be cancelled nor the intention not to renew be stated until
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail, of a written
notice addressed to the Zoning Inspector of such intent to cancel or not to
renew."
      (3)   Within 30 days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than 15 days prior to said cancellation, the service provider
shall obtain and furnish to the village replacement insurance policies meeting
the requirements of this section.

insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Ohio in relation to
the specific type of insurance required.
      (5)   Upon written application to, and written approval by, the Clerk-
Treasurer of the village, a service provider may be self-insured to provide all
of the same coverages as listed in this section. As part of the review process,
the Clerk-Treasurer may require, and the self-insurance applicant shall
provide, any and all financial documents necessary to make a valid
determination of the applicant's ability to meet the needs of this chapter.
   (F)   General indemnification. Each application for consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way shall include, to the extent permitted by law, the
service provider's express undertaking to defend, indemnify and hold the
village and its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents,
representatives and subcontractors harmless from and against any and all
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the service provider or its affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the design, construction,
reconstruction, installation, operation, maintenance, repairer removal of its
small cell facility and wireless support structure, and in providing or
offering services over the small cell facility and wireless support structure,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
chapter.

§ 154.03 GENERAL PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Public right-of-way route. Consent granted to a service provider to
occupy or use the public right-of-way under §
154.02 shall be limited to a grant to occupy or use the specific public right-
of-way and defined portions thereof, including the specific small cell facility
and wireless support structure and location along the public right-of-way, as
approved by the village.
   (B)   Nonexclusive consent to occupy the public right-of-way. No consent
granted under §
154.02 shall confer any exclusive right, privilege, license or franchise to
occupy or use the public right-of-way of the village other than as specifically
provided in said consent.
   (C)   Rights permitted. No consent granted under §
154.02 shall convey any right, title or interest in the public right-of-way,
but shall be deemed a consent only to occupy or use the public right-of-way for
the limited purposes granted by the consent. Further, no consent shall be
construed as any warranty of title.
   (D)   Maximum permitted height.
      (1)   Existing wireless support structures. For an existing wireless
support structure, the antenna and any associated shroud or concealment
material are permitted to be collocated at the top of the existing wireless
support structure and shall not increase the height of the existing wireless
support structure by more than five feet.
      (2)   New wireless support structures. For a new wireless support
structure, the overall height of the wireless support structure and any
collocated antenna shall not be more than 40 feet in height above established
grade measured at the base of the wireless support structure.
         (a)   The village may limit the maximum permissible height of the
wireless support structures to not less than 35 feet in height above
established grade measured at the base of the structure in areas meeting the
following criteria: The area is within 300 feet of the proposed site for a new
or existing wireless support structure in the same right-of-way or a connecting
right-of-way, and where there are no wireless support structures or utility
poles taller than 30 feet in height above ground level; and
         (b)   The maximum allowable height for building construction in the
underlying or adjacent zoning district is 35 feet in height above ground level
or less.
   (E)   Maximum size. The small cell facility must conform to the size
limitations as defined for a small cell facility in §
154.01(B) of this chapter.
   (F)   Color. The small cell facilities shall be a color or colors that are
consistent with or most blends into the wireless support structure on which
they are installed, unless a different color is needed for public safety or
service reliability reasons, all as determined by the Planning Commission.
   (G)   Wiring and cabling. Wires and cables connecting the small cell
facility shall be installed in accordance with the version of the National
Electrical Code adopted by the village and in force at the time of
installation. In no event shall wiring and cabling serving the small cell
facility interfere with any wiring or cabling installed by a cable television
or video service operator, electric utility, telephone utility or other
utility.
   (H)   Reservation by village for future uses. The village may reserve space
for future public safety or transportation uses in the public right-of-way, or
on a wireless support structure or pole owned by the village. Said reservation
of space shall be set forth in a documented plan, subject to the approval of
the Planning Commission. A reservation of space by the village shall not
preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a small cell facility by a
private service provider; provided, however, that said pole or wireless support
structure shall accommodate any future use reserved by the village. In the
event it is necessary to replace any village pole or wireless support structure
to accommodate the collocation of a service provider's small cell facility, the
service provider shall pay for the replacement of the village pole or wireless
support structure.
   (I)   Alternate location. The village may propose an alternate location to
the proposed location of a new wireless support structure that is either within
100 feet of the location set forth in a person's application for consent to
occupy or use a public right-of-way; or is within a distance that is equivalent
to the width of the public right-of-way that the new wireless support structure
is proposed to be located on; whichever is greater. Any applicant or service
provider shall be required to use the alternate location proposed by the
village, if the applicant or service provider has the right to use the
alternate location on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location does not impose technical limits or additional costs.
   (J)   Time for completion. Any collocation or construction of a new wireless
support structure shall be completed within 180 days after the issuance of a
consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way. The village and service
provider may extend this completion date by mutual agreement.
   (K)   Underground placement. No small cell facility or wireless support
structure shall be constructed in a public right-of-way that is located in an
area in which it was required, or will be required, under this code, to install
any electric facilities, telephone facilities, or any other utility facilities
underground. This prohibition shall not apply to the replacement of a wireless
support structure or the collocation of a small cell facility on a wireless
support structure that exists or might exist in said designated area. A service
provider may apply to the Planning Commission for a waiver of the underground
placement requirement for the construction of a new wireless support structure
if the service provider is unable to achieve its service objection under the
following circumstances:
      (1)   From a location in the public right-of-way where the prohibition
does not apply;
      (2)   In a utility easement the service provider has the right to access;
or
      (3)   In or on other suitable locations or structures made available by
the village at reasonable rates, fees and terms.
   (L)   Guy wires restricted. Guy wires and similar support structures may not
be used as part of the installation of any small cell facility and wireless

   (M)   Grounding. The small cell facility, including any ground-mounted
equipment shall be grounded in accordance with the requirements of the most
current edition of the National Electrical Code adopted by the village
regarding grounding of wireless facilities.
   (N)   Signage. Other than warning or notification signs required by federal
law, or identification and location markings or other markings required by the
village, a small cell facility and wireless support structure shall not have
signs installed thereon.
   (O)   Maintenance of small cell facility and wireless support structure.
Each service provider shall maintain its small cell facility and wireless
support structure in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with
all applicable federal, state and local requirements.
   (P)   Safety procedures. A service provider or other person acting on its
behalf shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares and other
measures as necessary and in accordance with applicable state and local
requirements for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent
injury or damage to any person, vehicle or property by reason of such work in
or affecting such public right-of-way or property.
   (Q)   Interference with the public right-of-ways. No service provider may
locate or maintain its small cell facility and wireless support structure so as
to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public right-of-way by the
village, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be
present in or upon the public right-of-way. All small cell facilities and
wireless support structures shall be moved by the service provider, temporarily
or permanently, as determined by the Zoning Inspector when necessary to protect
the public, comply with the provisions of this chapter, or otherwise comply
with local, state or federal laws. The expense or cost to move said small cell
facility and wireless support structure shall be the responsibility of the
service provider.
   (R)   Damage to public and private property. No service provider nor any
person acting on the service provider's behalf shall take any action or permit
any action to be done which may impair or damage any village property, public
right-of-way, or other public or private property located in, on or adjacent
thereto.
   (S)   Restoration of public right-of-way, other ways and village property.
      (1)   When a service provider, or any person acting on its behalf, does
any work in or affecting any public right-of-way or village property, it shall,
after the work is completed and at its own expense, promptly remove any
obstructions therefrom and restore such ways or property within ten to 30 days,
at the Zoning Inspector's discretion, to as good a condition as existed before
the work was undertaken, unless otherwise directed by the village.
      (2)   If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete
restoration required by this section, the service provider shall temporarily
restore the affected ways or property as directed by the Zoning Inspector. Such
temporary restoration shall be at the service provider's sole expense and the
service provider shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent
restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such
permanent restoration.
   (T)   Damage to service provider's small cell facility and wireless support
structure. Unless directly and proximately caused by the willful, intentional
or malicious acts of the village, the village shall not be liable for any
damage to or loss of any small cell facility or wireless support structure in
the public right-of-way of the village as a result of or in connection with,
but not limited to, any public works, public improvements, construction,
excavation, grading, filling, salting, snow removal or work of any kind in the
public right-of- way by or on behalf of the village.
   (U)   Duty to provide information. Within ten days of a written request from
the village, each service provider shall furnish the village with documentation
sufficient to show that the service provider has complied with all requirements
of this chapter.
   (V)   Assignments or transfers of consent. Consent to occupy or use the
public right-of-way may be, directly or indirectly, transferred, assigned or
disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation or other act of the service
provider, by operation of law or otherwise, without consent of the village, so
long as:
      (1)   The village is notified of the proposed transfer on or before the
date of transfer; and
      (2)   The transferee shall fully comply with this chapter within 60 days
of the transfer, including but not limited to:
         (a)   All information required by the application for consent to
occupy and use the public right-of-way pursuant to §
154.02; and
         (b)   Any other information reasonably required by the village.
   (W)   Revocation of consent. Consent granted by the village to occupy or use
the public right-of-way of the village may be revoked for any one of the
following reasons:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation at an unauthorized location;
      (2)   Construction, reconstruction, installation, location, operation or
excavation in violation of village safety and/or construction requirements;
      (3)   Material misrepresentation or lack of candor by or on behalf of a
service provider in any permit application or registration required by the
village;
      (4)   Abandonment of small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure in the public right-of-way;
      (5)   Failure to relocate or remove a small cell facility and/or wireless
support structure or failure to restore the public right-of-way, as required by
this chapter;
      (6)   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the service provider;
      (7)   The small cell facility and/or wireless support structure is in a
state of disrepair which creates a public nuisance;
      (8)   Violation of material provisions of this chapter; or
      (9)   Construction under the consent is not commenced within two years of
the consent approval date.
   (X)   Notice and duty to cure. In the event that the Zoning Inspector
believes that grounds exist for revocation of consent to occupy or use the
public right-of-way or construction permit, the Zoning Inspector shall give the
service provider written notice of the apparent violation or noncompliance,
providing a short and concise statement of the nature and general facts of the
violation or noncompliance, and providing the service provider a reasonable
period of time not exceeding 30 days to furnish evidence:
      (1)   That corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
      (2)   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; and/or
      (3)   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
   (Y)   Municipal structures. A service provider may collocate a small cell
facility on a wireless support structure owned by the village and which is
located in the public right-of-way, provided that the person complies with
applicable design guidelines and conditions for such collocation adopted by the
village that are consistent with said design guidelines under this chapter. The
village may condition approval of said collocation on the replacement or
modification of the village's wireless support structure, at the service
provider's cost, if the village determines that replacement or modification of
the village's wireless support structure is necessary. The village shall retain
ownership of any village wireless support structure that is replaced. The
village shall annually charge the amount of $200 per each small cell facility
collocated on a wireless support structure owned by the village and located in
the public right-of-way.

§ 154.04 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF SMALL CELL FACILITY AND WIRELESS
SUPPORT STRUCTURE.
   (A)   Excess capacity. To reduce excavation and congestion in the public
right-of-way, it is the village's goal to encourage service providers to share
occupancy of utility poles, as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess
available space on utility poles and wireless support structures for occupancy
of future small cell facilities in the public right-of-way. The service
provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate to other providers for
occupancy of the additional utility pole space as reimbursement.
   (B)   Relocation or removal of facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, a service provider shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of
any small cell facility and wireless support structure in the public right-of-
way whenever the village shall have determined that such removal, relocation,
change or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
      (1)   The construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any village or other public improvement in or upon the public
right-of-way; or
      (2)   The operations of the village or other governmental entity in or
upon the public right-of-way.
   (C)   Removal of unauthorized small cell facility and wireless support
structure. Within 30 days following written notice from the village, any

unauthorized small cell facility, wireless support structure or related
appurtenances in the public right-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove the
small cell facility, wireless support structure or appurtenances from the
public right-of-way of the village. After 30 days have expired, the village may
remove the small cell facility, wireless support structure or appurtenances
from the public right-of-way at the other party's expense. A small cell
facility and wireless support structure is unauthorized and subject to removal
in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the service provider's consent to occupy or use
the public right-of-way;
      (2)   Upon abandonment of a small cell facility and wireless support
structure in the public right-of-way of the village;
      (3)   If the small cell facility and wireless support structure was
constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained without
the consent to do so, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (4)   If the small cell facility and wireless support structure was
constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained, or any
excavation of a public right-of-way was performed, without prior issuance of a
required construction permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter; or
      (5)   If the small cell facility and wireless support structure was
constructed, reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained, or any
excavation of a public right-of-way was performed, at a location not permitted
pursuant to the village's consent to occupy or use the public right-of-way or
construction permit.
   (D)   Emergency removal or relocation of small cell facility and wireless
support structure. The village retains the right and privilege to cut or move
any facilities, or stop work on any construction, reconstruction, installation,
operation or excavation, located in the public right-of-way of the village, as
the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to
any need to protect the public health, safety or welfare.

behalf, shall commence any work in the public right-of-way of the village
without 24 hours advance notice to the village obtaining consent to occupy or
use the public right-of-way pursuant to §
154.02, if required.
   (B)   Routine maintenance and new service orders.
      (1)   A service provider need not obtain a construction permit or notify
the village prior to or after commencing any routine maintenance or new service
orders that do not include the construction in, or excavation or lane
obstruction of, a public right-of-way or closing of a public street.
      (2)   For routine maintenance and new service orders that require the
service provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
two hours, the service provider shall provide the village with 48 hours advance
written notice prior to commencing the routine maintenance or new service
order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic maintenance and
indicating how the service provider will meet all requirements of ODOTs Manual
of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable governmental regulations.
   (C)   Emergency work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
emergency work, a service provider may commence such emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for the work that requires
excavation of a public right-of-way or lane obstruction or closing of a public
street, the service provider shall notify the village as promptly as possible
before commencing such emergency work, or as soon as possible thereafter if
advance notice is not practicable. When notice is required the service provider
shall notify the Zoning Inspector.

chapter conflicts with any other provision of the village's codified ordinances
or other ordinances or resolutions of the village the more restrictive
provision shall govern.
