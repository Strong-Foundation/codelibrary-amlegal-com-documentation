ADOPTING ORDINANCE
Ordinance 596-92
   Passed: September 10, 1992
   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND
TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY.
   Whereas, the Council of the Village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   Whereas, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification and general
revision, and
   Whereas, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is before
the Council,
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Put-in-Bay,
Ohio, that:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, arranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, 1992.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Put-in-Bay,
Ohio.
   Section 2. That all ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted
prior to May 15, 1992, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in the
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege;
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment;
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation;
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness;
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges;
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way;
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval;
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory;
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to May 15, 1992.
   Section 3. That pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.23, the Clerk-Treasurer shall
post, in the five public posting places provided for in Section 222.01 of the
Codified Ordinances, a notice of the enactment of this ordinance, containing
the title of this ordinance, together with a summary of the new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances hereby approved, adopted and enacted, a
copy of which summary is attached hereto. All sections and subsections of the
Codified Ordinances with the words "Adopting Ordinance" or with no history at
the end thereof are or contain new matter in the Codified Ordinances.
   Section 4. That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health
and safety of the Village for the reason that it is necessary to have a current
codification of the legislation of the Village, one which is consistent with
State law, as required by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution,
to properly provide for the administration of government and to assure law and
order in the Village, for which reasons this ordinance, including the Codified
Ordinances hereby approved, adopted and enacted, shall take effect and be in
force upon and after its passage.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in
Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross
references and any future legislation.

of members that is one less than the number of members that would otherwise be
eligible for election at that regular municipal election but for the first-time
implementation of the new membership of five, or, in the case of a village that
has previously reduced its number of members to five, then the number of
members eligible for election at that regular municipal election shall be

in addition to his or her regular compensation as a member of Council. Any
member who ceases to possess any of such qualifications or who removes from the
Village shall forfeit his or her office.
   The purpose of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this section
is to recognize that Council has a substantial and compelling interest in
encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of member of
Council by ensuring that a candidate for such office has every opportunity to
become knowledgeable with and concerned about the problems and needs of the
area he or she seeks to represent. In enacting this requirement, Council finds
that the one-year period is reasonably related to this purpose, while leaving
unimpaired a person's right to travel, to vote and to be a candidate for public
office.
(ORC 731.12)
220.05 COMPENSATION AND BONDS OF VILLAGE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Council will fix the compensation and bonds of all officers, clerks
and employees of the Village except as otherwise provided by law. Council will,
in the case of elective officers, fix their compensation for the ensuing term
of office at a meeting held not later than five days prior to the last day
fixed by law for filing as a candidate for such office. All bonds shall be made
with sureties subject to the approval of the Mayor. The compensation so fixed
shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which any officer is
elected or appointed. This section does not prohibit the payment of any
increased costs of continuing to provide the identical benefits provided to an
officer at the commencement of his or her term of office.
   (b)   Compensation for Council members shall be three hundred seventy-five
dollars ($375.00) per month. In order to qualify for this monthly compensation,
a member must attend at least one regular Council meeting in that month.
Failure to attend at least one regular Council meeting in a month will result
in no compensation being paid to the member for that respective month.
   (c)   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.13, the compensation so fixed pursuant to
this section shall not be increased or diminished; this section shall have no
effect upon those members of the Council of the Village of Put-in-Bay during
the term for which such member was elected or appointed; and this section will
not be effective upon each individual Council member until such time as he or
she is reelected. This section, however, shall be effective immediately upon
passage and approval for those members of the Council of the Village of Put-in-
Bay elected or appointed after such date of approval.
   (d)   Members of Council may waive all or a portion of the salary set forth
in division (b) above.
   (e)   Nothing contained herein diminishes the expectation that members make
every effort to attend regular and special meetings and the committee meetings
to which they are appointed.

her unexpired term as a member of Council when the Mayor's successor is elected
and qualified in accordance with that section.
   If the President Pro Tempore decides to serve the remainder of his or her
unexpired term as a member of Council, the vacancy on Council shall not be
filled and the President Pro Tempore shall resume serving his or her unexpired
term on Council as soon as the Mayor's successor is elected and qualified. If
the President Pro Tempore decides not to resume serving the remainder of his or
her unexpired term as a member of Council, as soon as the Mayor's successor is

satisfaction of the Mayor, within ten days after such service, Council shall
declare the office vacant, and the vacancy shall be filled in the manner
provided in Section
220.06.
   When the new bond is accepted or Council declares the office vacant, the

   (d)   The Mayor shall suspend from employment a Chief of Police, deputy
marshal, police officer, night watchperson, special police officer or Auxiliary
Police Officer who is convicted, after trial, of a felony. If the Chief of

officer or Auxiliary Police Officer files an appeal from that conviction and
the conviction is upheld by the highest court to which the appeal is taken, or
if that person does not file a timely appeal, the Mayor shall terminate that
person's employment. If the Chief of Police, deputy marshal, police officer,
night watchperson, special police officer or Auxiliary Police Officer files an

Mayor shall reinstate that person. A Chief of Police, deputy marshal, police
officer, night watchperson, special police officer or Auxiliary Police Officer

charge was dismissed, because the court found insufficient evidence to convict
that person of the felony.

that was committed prior to January 1, 1997.
   (f)   The suspension from employment or the termination of the employment of

police officer or Auxiliary Police Officer under subsections (b) through (e)
hereof shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 119.

   (a)   The Village shall publish a statement notifying employees that the

   (b)   Legal action may be taken against employees who violate local, State

   (h)   The Chief of Police of the Village of Put-in-Bay is hereby directed to
act as the coordinator of this program.
(Res. 390-91. Passed 9-12-91.)
248.05 DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY.
   (a)   Intent. It is the intent of the Village to establish and maintain a
safe, efficient and healthy working environment for all employees and other
persons and to reduce absenteeism, tardiness and job problems.
   (b)   Alcohol. No employee, while performing Village business or while on
the premises of the Village, shall use or be under the influence of alcohol.
Such use or influence may affect the safety of co-workers or members of the
public, the employee's job performance and the operation of the equipment and
facilities of the Village. Any employee whose off-duty abuse of alcohol results
in excessive absenteeism or tardiness, or is the cause of accidents or poor job
performance, will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
   (c)   Prescriptions and Medications. Prescriptions and medications may be
brought to work only by the person to whom the medication is prescribed by a
licensed medical practitioner and shall be used only in the proper manner and
quantity prescribed by said physician. The employee must give a list of
prescriptions to his or her immediate supervisor. An employee may continue to
work while taking prescribed medication only if his or her supervisor
determines that the influence of the medication does not pose a threat to the
safety of the employee, or to others or property, and that the employee's job
performance will not be adversely affected by the medication. Otherwise, the
employee may be required to take a leave of absence or comply with other action
determined by the Village. The employee's physician may be asked to certify
that the use of a prescribed medication is consistent with the safe performance
of the employee's job duties.
   Any employee whose abuse of prescriptions and medications results in
excessive absenteeism or tardiness, or is the cause of accidents or poor job
performance, will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
   (d)   Illegal Drugs. No employee shall use, sell, purchase, transfer or
possess any illegal drug while on Village premises, while in possession of a
Village vehicle or during the performance of Village business. Any employee who
is found to be in possession of, using, selling or transferring any illegal
substance will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination. Also,
any employee whose abuse results in excessive absenteeism or poor job
performance will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination. 
   Any employee convicted under any Federal or State criminal drug statute must
notify the Fiscal Officer, in writing, of that fact within five calendar days
of said conviction. Any employee convicted of a work place related drug offense
who fails to report the conviction within five days, in writing, to the Fiscal
Officer will be:
      (1)   Terminated from employment;
      (2)   Forever barred from future employment with the Village;
      (3)   Held civilly liable for any loss of Federal or State funds
resulting from the failure to report the conviction.
   (e)   Testing for Alcohol and Drugs.
      (1)   Pre-employment substance abuse screening. Any applicant to the
Village for any position may be required to complete appropriate release forms,
at the site of said Village's drug collection agency, to be known as Firelands
Community Hospital (Corporate Health Services), acknowledging that he or she is
willing to submit to a physical examination which will include an eight panel
urine drug screen test for drugs of abuse. Refusal to complete the forms will
result in rejection of the applicant's employment. It will be the policy of the
Village of Put-in-Bay not to hire anyone for any position who tests positive
during drug screening unless that person is taking medication prescribed for
him or her by a licensed physician or dentist. Individuals who fail to pass the
substance abuse screening will be disqualified and will not be considered for
employment.
      (2)   Compliance with request of law enforcement officers for drug
screens. Village employees are required to comply with the request of any law
enforcement officer to submit to drug screens, whether these be random urine
drug screens, breathalyzer tests or blood alcohol or drug tests, following any
involving incident or following a motor vehicle incident or accident. Any
employee of the Village who refuses to sign the required release forms for such
tests or who refuses to cooperate in specimen donation will be subject to
discipline, in addition to any penalties of law that may apply. Should any
employee test positive for drugs for which he or she has no legal prescription,
he or she will not be allowed to return to his or her regular duties but will
be subject to a corrective interview with a supervisor and/or the Village and
shall begin the disciplinary chain at that point.
      (3)   Reasonable cause testing. When there is reasonable cause to believe
that any employee on duty may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the
Village may require the employee to submit to blood alcohol tests, urine drug
screens or other appropriate tests. Reasonable cause will be determined by
management only after a total evaluation of all the facts and circumstances
surrounding the situation. The Village may require testing when an employee has
been involved in an accident or injury on Village premises or in a Village
vehicle and when any supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that the employee
was under the influence of alcohol or drugs of abuse. An employee who refuses
to sign the required release forms for such tests or who refuses to cooperate
in specimen donation will be subject to discipline, up to and including
termination, in addition to any penalties of law that may apply. Should an
employee test positive for drugs for which he or she has no legal prescription,
he or she will not be allowed to return to his or her regular duties but will
be subject to a corrective interview with his or her supervisor and shall begin
the disciplinary chain at that point.
      (4)   Post-accident testing. The Village will require its employees to
provide a urine and/or blood specimen for chemical testing following incidents
occurring on Village property.
         Should an incident occur, the Village supervisor must be notified and
the involved employee(s) may be requested to submit to a drug and/or alcohol
test.
         Should an employee refuse to sign required release forms for such
tests or refuse to cooperate in specimen donation, he or she will be subject to
discipline, up to and including termination. Should an employee test positive
for alcohol or drugs for which he or she has no legal prescription, he or she
will not be allowed to return to his or her regular duties but will be subject
to a corrective interview with the supervisor and shall begin the referral and
disciplinary chain at that point. The employee will be offered the opportunity
of referral for evaluation and appropriate professional help. If the employee
chooses not to seek professional help, or accepts such help but fails to
respond to treatment or to complete the prescribed program, the employee will
then be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If at
any time following successful rehabilitation an employee is once re-tested as
positive for substance abuse, he or she will be subject to immediate
termination.
         Should an employee test positive for drugs for which he or she has no
legal prescription following a fatal accident, he or she will face immediate
termination with no option for assistance.
   (f)   Treatment and Rehabilitation. Prior to entering a treatment program
and as a condition of continued employment upon successful completion of
rehabilitation, the employee must sign a "Letter of Conditional Employment"
agreeing to random re-testing for a period of up to two years. A positive
finding during such period shall be cause for immediate termination.
   During approved treatment or rehabilitation for substance abuse, the Village
will treat the employee as disabled and shall offer the same benefits as
approved for any other disability. Employees granted a medical leave of absence
for in-patient treatment will have their file reflect this medical leave
without mention of the medical reason. Upon returning to work, the employee
will be required to submit to a urine test for drugs of abuse. A negative test
is required before the employee may return to regular job duties.
(Ord. 664-96. Passed 8-8-96.)
248.06 SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND GENERAL HARASSMENT POLICIES.
   (a)   Application. All employees and elected officials shall be subject to
the policies set forth in this section.
   (b)   Legal Definitions and Guidelines.
      (1)   Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. It is against Village employment policies and constitutes sexual
harassment for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another
employee by using unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical) or
requests for favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature
when:
         A.   Submission to such conduct is either an explicit or implicit term
or condition of employment (e.g. promotion, training, timekeeping, overtime
assignments, etc.);
         B.   Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for
making employment decisions; or
         C.   The conduct creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
working environment.
      (2)   Sexual harassment does not refer to behavior or occasional
compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not
welcome, that is personally offensive, that fails to respect the rights of
others, that lowers the morale, and that interferes with work effectiveness.
      (3)   Harassment of any kind, whether based on gender or not, is conduct
by an individual or a group that creates a hostile, intimidating, or offensive
work environment. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, that is offensive
and that fails to respect the rights of others. Any and all forms of harassment
are against Village employment policies and are subject to the full penalties
of this policy.
   (c)   Procedure.
      (1)   Employee.
         A.   Any employee who believes that he or she has been sexually
harassed or harassed in any other manner should report the alleged act
immediately to his or her direct supervisor.
         B.   If the direct supervisor is the alleged harasser or the employee
does not feel comfortable discussing the matter with his or her direct
supervisor, the employee may bypass his or her direct supervisor and report the
alleged act to any other supervisor, the office of the Mayor, or any other
designated official.
      (2)   Supervisor. After receiving notification of any employee's
complaint, the supervisor will immediately contact the Chief of Police or other
designated official.
      (3)   The Chief of Police. The Chief of Police shall investigate, or
designate an appropriate, fair, and impartial official or office to
investigate, any and all allegations of sexual harassment or other harassment
and report such findings to the Mayor.
   Investigation of a complaint will normally include conferring with the
parties involved and any named or apparent witnesses. All employees shall be
protected from coercion, intimidation, retaliation, interference, or
discrimination for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation.
   (d)   Penalties. If the investigation reveals that the complaint is valid,
prompt attention and disciplinary action designed to stop the harassment
immediately and to prevent its recurrence will be taken. Based on the
seriousness of the offense, disciplinary action may include verbal or written
reprimand, suspension or termination.
   (e)   Confidentiality. All complaints will be handled in a timely and
confidential manner. In no event will information concerning a complaint be
released by anyone employed by the Village to third parties or to anyone else
employed by the Village who is not involved with the investigation, nor will
anyone involved be permitted to discuss the subject outside the investigation.
The purpose of this provision is to protect the confidentiality of the employee
who files a complaint, to encourage the reporting of any incidents of sexual
harassment, and to protect the reputation of any employee wrongfully charged
with sexual harassment.
   (f)   Non-Retaliation. This policy also prohibits retaliation against
employees who file or report sexual harassment or harassment allegations or
assist in investigating charges. Any employee bringing a sexual harassment or
other harassment complaint or assisting in the investigation of such a
complaint will not be adversely affected in terms and conditions of employment,
nor discriminated against or discharged because of the complaint.

the same effect.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction and are the meanings of the words defined.
   (a)   "Fiscal Officer" means the Fiscal Officer of the Village of Put-in-
Bay, Ottawa County, Ohio, or his or her appointed designee.
   (b)   "Lodging" means every establishment, used, maintained, advertised or
held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are offered
for a consideration to guests, in which one or more rooms are used for the
accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in one or several
structures. This includes but is not limited to hotels, motels, bed and
breakfasts, cottages, cabins, condominiums, lodging houses and vacation homes.
   (c)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any lodging
establishment for dwelling, or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office
space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space
shall not be considered in occupancy within the meaning of this definition,
unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to
use or possess, all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling,
lodging or sleeping purposes.
   (d)   "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the lodging
establishment, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in
possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his
functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an
employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes
of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his
principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the
principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance
by both.
   (e)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint ventures,
association, social club, fraternal organization, society, joint-stock
companies, corporation, limited liability company, estate, trust, business
trust, receiver, trustee, trustee in bankruptcy, syndicate, or any other group

whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (g)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than 30 consecutive days.
   (h)   "Village" and "Village of Put-in-Bay" may be used interchangeably to
mean the Village of Put-in-Bay, Ottawa County, Ohio.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the Village of Put-in-Bay, for the use of the general fund of the Village, an
excise tax is hereby levied on transactions by which lodging is, or is to be
furnished to transient guests within the incorporated areas of the Village.
   (b)   The tax is one and one-half percent on all rents paid or to be paid by
the transient guest for the lodging. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the
transient guest to the Village of Put-in-Bay, which is extinguished only by
payment to the operator as trustee for the Village, or to the Village. The
transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the lodging establishment
at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the
lodging establishment. The operator shall collect from the transient guest the
full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.04 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter upon rents not within the
taxing power of the Village under the Constitution or laws of Ohio, or of the
United States.
   (b)   No exemption from the tax imposed by this chapter which is claimed
under this section shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the
time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by
the Fiscal Officer.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.05 PROHIBITION AGAINST FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the operator false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to tax.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.06 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for said occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the Village, and the operator shall
be liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a lodging establishment shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the
rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner
hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.07 REGISTRATION.

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Village
of Put-in-Bay Lodging Excise Tax Ordinance by registering with the Fiscal
Officer for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Lodging Excise
Tax and remitting said tax to the Fiscal Officer. This certificate does not
constitute a permit."
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.08 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting
period which may be established by the Fiscal Officer, make a return to the
Fiscal Officer, on forms provided by him or her, of total rents charged and
received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. All claims
for exemption from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Fiscal
Officer. The Fiscal Officer may establish shorter reporting periods for any
certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to ensure
collection of the tax, and he or she may require further information in the
return if such information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns
and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the Village until payment thereof is made to the Fiscal
Officer. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated
as confidential by the Fiscal Officer and shall not be released by him or her

agent of the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Ottawa, or the
Village for official use only, or in order to comply with the requirements of
Ohio R.C. 149.43. The Fiscal Officer or his or her designate may conduct such
audits, as are deemed necessary in order to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and the imposition and payment of the tax. Audits
are an integral part of administering the tax.
   (b)   No operator or other person shall fail or refuse to register as
required herein, or furnish any return required to be made, or fail or refuse
to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Fiscal Officer,
or render a false or fraudulent return or claim. No person required to make,
render, sign or verify any report or claim, shall make a false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this chapter to be made.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.09 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this
chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to 10% of the amount
of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Fraud. If the Fiscal Officer determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to 25% of
the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties
stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate per annum prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47, on the amount of the tax
exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.

280.11 nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board of Review provided
for in Section
280.12.

   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction
if exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be
opened for a period of three years, unless the Fiscal Officer, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by any others requesting
that such records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)

immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)
280.13 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the Village.

the Village under the provisions of this chapter, which debt has become
delinquent, shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the Village for
the recovery of the amount of tax due.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)

limited liability shall not discharge an officer's, member's or employee's
liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax
due. The sum due for such liability may be collected by assessment, or in any
other manner provided in this chapter, or by law.
(Ord. 1055-12. Passed 5-13-13.)

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
         
Chap. 290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Put-in-Bay has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a Put-
in-Bay ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving
traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate
limits of Put-in-Bay, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by
the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
the Mayor unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Ottawa County (the Port Clinton Municipal Court) and the
magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript
of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to
the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to a
jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands
a jury trial.
   The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by
Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not
made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to
a jury trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any Put-
in-Bay ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed
a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as the offender submits to the court both the
offender’s payment in full and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine

         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer's law enforcement agency;
         B.   Ensure that such report indicates the offender's race.

violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of
the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code
is substantially equivalent.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   (e)   (1)   The operator of a vehicle shall stop in obedience to a stop sign
at an intersection where a stop sign is erected pursuant to this division (e),
and shall yield the right-of-way to all other vehicles not so obligated to
stop. The driver of a vehicle proceeding on any street designated in this
division (e) as a stop street shall come to a full stop before proceeding to
cross an intersecting street designated in this division as the right-of-way
street, and in case shall not proceed until it is safe to do so. The
intersections defined hereinbelow shall be designated as "stop intersections"
as defined in Section
402.42 of these Codified Ordinances.

414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that
            issued the report, and a notation that performing an analysis of
the type involved is part of the analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
         (ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
       (3)   Reasonable grounds. The chemical test or tests under division (g)
(2) of this section shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement
officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in
physical control of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance
identified in division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by
which the officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be
administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person
if convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)
(c), (d), or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
            (ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person’s license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the

tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s
               license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is
suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at least until the
person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held within five days
after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a citation to the
person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the initial appearance
or during the period of time ending 30 days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from

driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’ arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous

distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined
in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.

religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in division (a)(2) of this section. The
Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve as
the written documentation described in division (a)(2) of this section, and
employers, school officials, officials affiliated with religious events, and
holders of probationary driver’s licenses may utilize that form or may choose

travel or parking with more than one person who is not a family member
occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is accompanied by
the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian, or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of division (a)(1)A. or
(a)(1)B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed
that required the holder of the probationary driver’s license to operate a
motor vehicle in violation of division (a)(1)A. or (a)(1)B. of this section or
the holder was an emancipated minor.

attaining the age of 17 years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the holder’s parent
or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle upon a highway or
any public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular
travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months or the date the holder
attains the age of 17 years, whichever occurs first.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under division (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that division. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   A restricted license may be issued to a person who is 14 or 15 years
of age under proof of hardship satisfactory to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (g)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

section has been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest or
commencing a prosecution of a person for such a violation.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor or
motorcycle vehicle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to § 698.02(d) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding
§
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding § 698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the
offender may be ordered pursuant to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.

within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic
monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the
court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall
the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         B.   A fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and

offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The 10-day mandatory
jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to division (c) of this section, the
court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 90 consecutive days of house
arrest with electronic monitoring. The period of house arrest with electronic

or two or more equivalent offenses, driving under OVI suspension is a
misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         A.   A mandatory jail term of 30 consecutive days. Notwithstanding the
jail terms provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence the

offense is registered in the offender’s name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender’s vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle
that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is
assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)(2).
   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.

or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor's

grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this
section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver's license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after

the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section
408.02.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a condition of
issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief's territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief's or trooper's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief's records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
Municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (g) of this section is guilty of a
parking violation and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the
Municipality in disposing of such abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money
accruing to the Municipality from such disposal.

defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief

      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (b)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders

was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into

from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.

            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by

unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under

which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B.   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more

unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a

            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to

the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides

infraction charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make or model

infraction charged. The officer shall sign, either physically or

subjects both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties,

operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance
with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement and
if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section

the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle who pays
any fine, penalty, fees, and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in the parking infraction.

453.05 ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)   A person who is personally or constructively served with a parking

appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau or by mail. An answer
shall be made within thirty days from the date of the infraction and shall be
in one of the following forms:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the parking infraction;
      (2)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, with
an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)   A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction. If the person desires the
presence, at the hearing, of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request his presence in his answer.
   (b)   (1)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction
shall, and a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may
be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may
be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
            If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation
mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the
Parking Violations Bureau shall eliminate or reduce the amount of the fine
arising out of the parking infraction. If the fine is eliminated or reduced and
the person has previously paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the
revised fine shall be returned to the person; if the fine is eliminated or
reduced and the person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay
only the amount of the revised fine. If the Parking Violations Bureau
determines that the explanation does not mitigate the fact that the person
committed the parking infraction, the person owes the entire amount of the fine
arising out of the parking infraction, and if the person has not previously
paid the fine, the person shall pay the entire amount of the fine. If a person
admits that he committed a parking infraction with explanation and the person
fails to pay the amount of the fine due within ten days after receiving notice
of the Parking Violations Bureau's determination, unless the amount due has
previously been paid, the Parking Violations Bureau's determination and the
amount of the fine due shall be considered a judgment and shall be treated as
if it were a judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to Section
453.07(d) hereof.
      (3)   A person who denies that he committed a parking infraction shall be
granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
453.07 hereof.
   (c)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in division (a) of this section, the Parking Violations
Bureau shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant to Section
453.06 hereof, and proceed according to that section. Failure to answer the
charge within the thirty-day period provided by division (a) of this section
shall result in the imposition of an additional penalty of 30% of the amount
due.
   (d)   The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.

infraction also shall be paid. The answer shall be governed by the provisions
of Section 453.05(b) hereof for answers relative to parking infractions charged
in a parking ticket, except that any determination of the amount to be paid
under an answer admitting the commission of the parking infraction with
explanation also shall consider any penalty, fee, or cost arising out of such
infraction.

453.07 HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   (1)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives
a notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction. Each hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. Each
hearing shall be conducted in such manner as the hearing examiner considers
appropriate. Rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall be under oath.
      (2)   At the hearing, the Village has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being
conducted committed the parking infraction. If the person, in his answer,
denied that he committed the parking infraction and requests the presence at
the hearing of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, the
officer shall be required to attend the hearing unless the hearing examiner
determines that the officer's presence is not required. If the officer's
presence at the hearing has been requested and the officer is unable to attend
the hearing on the day and at the time scheduled, the hearing examiner may
grant a reasonable continuance. The person for whom the hearing is being
conducted may present any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing. The
person does not have to attend the hearing if he submits documentary evidence
to the hearing examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
      (3)   The Village shall submit the original or a true copy of the parking
ticket that was personally or constructively served on the person, and
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the owner of the
vehicle. The ticket and the information in proper form is prima-facie evidence
that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who committed the
parking infraction. The Village may present additional evidence and testimony
at the hearing. The Village does not have to be represented at the hearing by
an attorney.
   (b)   (1)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under division
(a) of this section appears at the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in
accordance with that division, the hearing examiner shall consider all evidence
and testimony presented and shall determine whether the Village has
established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction. If the hearing examiner determines that the person
committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a judgment
against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate fine and any
additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under division
(a) of this section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to
submit evidence in accordance with that division, the hearing examiner shall,
if he determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the parking
infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the person
to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs. A
default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the records of
the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)   If a person who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section 453.06 hereof does not timely answer, as provided in division (c) of
that section, the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, if
he determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the
person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and
costs. A default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (4)   If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in division (b)(1),
(2), or (3) of this section committed the parking infraction, the hearing
examiner shall enter judgment against the Village, shall dismiss the charge of
the parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the judgment and
dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)   A default judgment entered under this section may be vacated by the
hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one year of the date of entry
of the judgment;
         B.   The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose;
         C.   The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)   (1)   Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a
person pursuant to this section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the
Parking Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten days of
the date of entry. All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment of default
judgment shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the Village and the
Violations Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its
disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. If payment is not
made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment may be filed
with the office of the Ottawa County Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when
so filed, shall have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil
action rendered in the Court.
      (2)   As required by Ohio R.C. 4521.08(C), judgments and default
judgments filed with the Put-in-Bay Mayor's Court, office of the Clerk of
Court, Civil Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment
roll from other judgments rendered in that Court. Computer printouts,
microfilm, microdot, microfiche, or other similar data recording techniques may
be utilized to record such judgments. When a judgment or default judgment is
filed with the Court, execution may be levied, and such other measures may be
taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid
money judgment in a civil action rendered in that Court. The Mayor's Court may
assess additional costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not exceeding
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each parking infraction, to be paid upon
satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)   (1)   Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is
entered pursuant to this section, and the Village of Put-in-Bay if judgment is
entered against the Village pursuant to this section, may appeal the judgment
or default judgment to the Ottawa County Municipal Court by filing notices of
appeal with the Parking Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within 15
days of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable
costs as the Court requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Court shall
schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time, and place of
the hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance with the
rules of the Court. Service of a notice of appeal under this division by a
person does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default
judgment from which appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files
the appeal posts bond with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the
judgment, plus court costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal
of the Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the
Parking Violations Bureau and no appeal of the judgment of the Municipal Court
may be taken.
   (e)   A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to this section may be
filed with the Court, and the office of the Ottawa County Clerk of Court, Civil
Division, under division (c) of this section at any time within three years
after the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose. This division applies to any ticket
issued for an offense that would be a parking infraction on or after the
effective date of this section, if the ticket was issued within three years
prior to the effective date of this section and a warrant has not been issued
and served on the operator or owner of the vehicle involved in that offense.

the parking infraction or by paying the fine arising out of the parking
infraction within 30 days after actual receipt of the parking ticket charging
the infraction or, if the owner did not receive the parking ticket, within 30
days after receipt of the notification of infraction.

against a person pursuant to Section

or electric bicycle operator who violates any provisions of this title
described in division (a) of this section that is applicable to bicycles or

watercraft-related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was taken a
concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
for a violation of division (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), or (a)(5) of this section
or less than the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a
listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of
division (a)(6) of this section, that fact may be considered with other
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant or in
making an adjudication for the child. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division
(b) of this section or for a violation of a prohibition that is substantially
equivalent to that division.
      (5)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney
immediately upon completion of the test analysis.
      (6)   If the chemical test was administered pursuant to division (d)(2)
of this section, the person tested may have a physician, registered nurse, or
qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the
direction of a law enforcement officer, and shall be so advised. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
   (e)   (1)   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating or being in physical control of any vessel underway or to
manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device on the waters of this
state while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination
of them, or of a municipal ordinance relating to operating or being in physical
control of any vessel underway or to manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device on the waters of this state with a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement
officer has administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person found
to be in physical control of the vessel underway involved in the violation or
the person manipulating the water skis, aquaplane, or similar device involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety tests
for vehicles that were in effect at the time the tests were administered,
including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that have
been set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that by their
nature are not clearly inapplicable regarding the operation or physical control
of vessels underway or the manipulation of water skis, aquaplanes, or similar
devices, all of the following apply:
         A.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
         B.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field sobriety
test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
         C.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (e)(1)A. or (e)(1)B. of this section and if the testimony or evidence
is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony
or evidence, and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of
fact considers to be appropriate.
      (2)   Division (e)(1) of this section does not limit or preclude a court,
in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (e)(1) of this section.
   (f)   (1)   Subject to division (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a) or (b)
of this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent
to either of those divisions, the court shall admit as prima facie evidence a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division. The laboratory report shall contain all of the
following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant or child to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s or child’s
attorney or, if the defendant or child has no attorney, on the defendant or
child.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant or child to whom the report
pertains or the defendant’s or child’s attorney receives a copy of the report,
the defendant or child or the defendant’s or child’s attorney demands the
testimony of the person who signed the report. The judge in the case may extend
the seven-day time limit in the interests of justice.
   (g)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, Ohio R.C. 1547.111 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and a hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section, Ohio R.C. 1547.111 or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, is immune from criminal and civil liability based upon a claim of
assault and battery or any other claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for
any act performed in withdrawing blood from the person. The immunity provided
in this division also extends to an emergency medical service organization that
employs an emergency medical technician-intermediate or an emergency medical
technician-paramedic who withdraws blood under this section. The immunity
provided in this division is not available to a person who withdraws blood if
the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
   (h)   Division (a)(6) of this section does not apply to a person who
operates or is in physical control of a vessel underway or manipulates any
water skis, aquaplane, or similar device while the person has a concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that
equals or exceeds the amount specified in that division, if both of the
following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.

      (1)   “Cocaine” and “L.S.D.” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
2925.01.
      (2)   “Controlled substance” and “marihuana” have the same meanings as in
Ohio R.C. 3719.01.
      (3)   “Emergency medical technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical

      (4)   “Equivalent offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.181.
      (5)   “Equivalent offense that is watercraft-related” means an equivalent
offense that is one of the following:
         A.   A violation of division (a) of this section;
         B.   A violation of a municipal ordinance prohibiting a person from
operating or being in physical control of any vessel underway or from
manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device on the waters of this
State while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination
of them or prohibiting a person from operating or being in physical control of

         (ORC 1547.11)
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree and shall be punished as provided in division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3)
of this section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this
section, the court shall sentence the offender to a jail term of three
consecutive days and may sentence the offender pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.24 to
a longer jail term. In addition, the court shall impose upon the offender a
fine of not less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) nor more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The court may suspend the execution of the
mandatory jail term of three consecutive days that it is required to impose by
this division (j)(1) if the court, in lieu of the suspended jail term, places
the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25
and requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. The court
also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory jail term of three
consecutive days that it is required to impose by this division (j)(1) if the
court places the offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three consecutive days; requires the offender to
attend, for that part of the three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the drivers’ intervention program.
The court may require the offender, as a condition of community control, to
attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs, in
addition to the required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
      (2)   If, within ten years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of division (a) of this
section, Ohio R.C. 1547.11(A) or one other equivalent offense, the court shall
sentence the offender to a jail term of 10 consecutive days and may sentence
the offender pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.24 to a longer jail term. In addition,
the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not less than one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). In
addition to any other sentence that it imposes upon the offender, the court may
require the offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program that is
certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
      (3)   If, within ten years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to more than one violation or offense identified
in division (j)(2) of this section, the court shall sentence the offender to a
jail term of 30 consecutive days and may sentence the offender to a longer jail
term of not more than one year. In addition, the court shall impose upon the
offender a fine of not less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) nor more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). In addition to any other sentence that
it imposes upon the offender, the court may require the offender to attend a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
      (4)   Upon a showing that serving a jail term would seriously affect the
ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3)
of this section to continue the offender's employment, the court may authorize
that the offender be granted work release after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of 3, 10, or 30 consecutive days that the court is required
by division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)(3) of this section to impose. No court shall
authorize work release during the mandatory jail term of 3, 10, or 30
consecutive days that the court is required by division (j)(1), (j)(2), or (j)
(3) of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from the
place of employment and the place in which the jail term is served and the time
actually spent under employment.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code that
authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or the
placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned
or serving a jail term, no court shall suspend the mandatory jail term of 10 or
30 consecutive days required to be imposed by division (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this
section or place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to division (j)(2) or
(j)(3) of this section in any treatment program in lieu being imprisoned or
serving a jail term until after the offender has served the mandatory jail term
of 10 or 30 consecutive days required to be imposed pursuant to division (j)(2)
or (j)(3) of this section. Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code
that authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or
the placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being
imprisoned or serving a jail term, no court, except as specifically authorized
by division (j)(1) of this section, shall suspend the mandatory jail term of 3
consecutive days required to be imposed by division (j)(1) of this section or
place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section
in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned or serving a jail term
until after the offender has served the mandatory jail term of 3 consecutive
days required to be imposed pursuant to division (j)(1) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (j):
         A.   “Equivalent offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.181.
         B.   “Jail term” and “mandatory jail term” have the same meanings as
in Ohio R.C. 2929.01.

480.095 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Any person who operates or is in physical control of a
vessel or manipulates any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device upon any
waters in this municipality shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical
test or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for operating
or being in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
         B.   The test or tests under division (a)(1) of this section shall be
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer having reasonable
grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control of a vessel
or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of
Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance. The law
enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which test
or tests shall be administered.
      (2)   Any person who is dead or unconscious or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (a)(1) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C. 313.12 to 313.16.
   (b)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for operating or
being in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance and if the person previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
1547.11(A) or other equivalent offenses, the law enforcement officer shall
request the person to submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law
enforcement officer who makes a request pursuant to this division that a person
submit to a chemical test or tests is not required to advise the person of the
consequences of refusing to submit to the test or tests and is not required to
give the person the form described in division (c) of this section, but the
officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person
refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable
means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise
the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. The advice shall be in written
form prescribed by the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft and shall
be read to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. The reading of the form shall be witnessed by one or more persons, and
the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. Divisions (a)
(1)B. and (a)(2) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test
or tests pursuant to this division.
      (2)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (b)(1) of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
   (c)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, any person under
arrest for violating Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance shall be advised of the consequences of refusing to submit to a
chemical test or tests designated as provided in division (a) of this section.
The advice shall be in a written form prescribed by the Chief of the Division
of Parks and Watercraft and shall be read to the person. The form shall contain
a under arrest and read to the person by the arresting officer. The reading of
the form shall be witnessed by one or more persons, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation, and if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, if a law
enforcement officer asks a person under arrest for violating Ohio R.C. 1547.11
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to submit to a chemical test
or tests as provided in division (a) of this section, if the arresting officer
advises the person of the consequences of the person’s refusal as provided in
division (c) of this section, and the person refuses to submit, no chemical
test shall be given. Upon receipt of a sworn statement of the officer that the
arresting law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the
arrested person violated Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance and that the person refused to submit to the chemical test
upon the request of the officer, and upon receipt of the form as provided in
division (c) of this section certifying that the arrested person was advised of
the consequences of the refusal, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall inform the person by written notice that the person is
prohibited from operating or being in physical control of a vessel, from
manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device, and from registering
any watercraft in accordance with Ohio R.C. 1547.54, for one year following the
date of the alleged violation. The suspension of these operation, physical
control, manipulation, and registration privileges shall continue for the
entire one-year period, subject to review as provided in this section.
      (2)   If the person under arrest is the owner of the vessel involved in
the alleged violation, the law enforcement officer who arrested the person
shall seize the watercraft registration certificate and tags from the vessel
involved in the violation and forward them to the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft. The Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall
retain the impounded registration certificate and tags and shall impound all
other registration certificates and tags issued to the person in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 1547.54 and 1547.57, for a period of one year following the date
of the alleged violation, subject to review as provided in this section.
      (3)   If the arrested person fails to surrender the registration
certificate because it is not on the person of the arrested person or in the
watercraft, the law enforcement officer who made the arrest shall order the
person to surrender it within 24 hours to the law enforcement officer or the
law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer. If the person
fails to do so, the law enforcement officer shall notify the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft of that fact in the statement the officer
submits to the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft under this
division.
   (e)   Upon suspending a person’s operation, physical control, manipulation,
and registration privileges in accordance with division (d) of this section,
the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall notify the person in
writing, at the person’s last known address, and inform the person that the
person may petition for a hearing in accordance with division (f) of this
section. If a person whose operation, physical control, manipulation, and
registration privileges have been suspended petitions for a hearing or appeals
any adverse decision, the suspension shall begin at the termination of any
hearing or appeal unless the hearing or appeal results in a decision favorable
to the person.
   (f)   (1)   Any person who has been notified by the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating or being in
physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device and from registering any watercraft in accordance with Ohio R.C.
1547.54, or who has had the registration certificate and tags of the person’s
watercraft impounded pursuant to division (d) of this section, within 20 days
of the notification or impoundment, may file a petition in the municipal court
or the county court, or if the person is a minor in juvenile court, with
jurisdiction over the place at which the arrest occurred, agreeing to pay the
cost of the proceedings and alleging error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Watercraft under division (d) of this section or alleging one
or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in this
section, or both. The petitioner shall notify the Chief of the Division of
Parks and Watercraft of the filing of the petition and send the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft a copy of the petition.
      (2)   The scope of the hearing is limited to the issues of whether the
law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the petitioner was
operating or in physical control of a vessel or manipulating any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, whether the petitioner was placed
under arrest, whether the petitioner refused to submit to the chemical test
upon request of the officer, and whether the petitioner was advised of the
consequences of the petitioner’s refusal.
   (g)   (1)   The Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall furnish
the court a copy of the affidavit as provided in division (c) of this section
and any other relevant information requested by the court.
      (2)   In hearing the matter and in determining whether the person has
shown error in the decision taken by the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft as provided in division (d) of this section, the court shall decide
the issue upon the relevant, competent, and material evidence submitted by the
Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft or the person whose operation,
physical control, manipulation, and registration privileges have been
suspended. In the proceedings, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall be represented by the prosecuting attorney of the county in
which the petition is filed if the petition is filed in a county court or
juvenile court, except that if the arrest occurred within a city or village
within the jurisdiction of the county court in which the petition is filed, the
city director of law or village solicitor of that city or village shall
represent the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft. If the petition is
filed in the municipal court, the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft
shall be represented as provided in Ohio R.C. 1901.34.
      (3)   If the court finds from the evidence submitted that the person has
failed to show error in the action taken by the Chief of the Division of Parks
and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in one or more of the
matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in division (f) of this
section, or both, the court shall assess the cost of the proceeding against the
person and shall uphold the suspension of the operation, physical control, use,
and registration privileges provided in division (d) of this section. If the
court finds that the person has shown error in the action taken by the Chief of
the Division of Parks and Watercraft under division (d) of this section or in
one or more of the matters within the scope of the hearing as provided in
division (f) of this section, or both, the cost of the proceedings shall be
paid out of the county treasury of the county in which the proceedings were
held, Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft shall reinstate the
operation, physical control, manipulation, and registration privileges of the
person without charge, and the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft
shall return the registration certificate and tags, if impounded, without
charge.
      (4)   The court shall give information in writing of any action taken
under this section to the Chief of the Division of Parks and Watercraft.
   (h)   At the end of any period of suspension or impoundment imposed under
this section, and upon request of the person whose operation, physical control,
use, and registration privileges were suspended or whose registration
certificate and tags were impounded, the Chief of the Division of Parks and
Watercraft shall reinstate the person’s operation, physical control,
manipulation, and registration privileges by written notice and return the
certificate and tags.
   (i)   No person who has received written notice from the Chief of the
Division of Parks and Watercraft that the person is prohibited from operating
or being in control of a vessel, from manipulating any water skis, aquaplane,
or similar device, and from registering a watercraft, or who has had the
registration certificate and tags of the person’s watercraft impounded, in
accordance with division (d) of this section or Ohio R.C. 1547.111(D), shall
operate or be in physical control of a vessel or manipulate any water skis,
aquaplane, or similar device for a period of one year following the date of the
person’s alleged violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.

   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase "offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),

involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.

match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,

      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.

is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or
2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of

that violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16,
2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.01 or Ohio R.C. 2903.02
if the conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4,
2023, and applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity
in committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy,
attempt, or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution
for that conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section
as it existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10 FALSIFICATION.

following applies:

      (3)   The statement is made with purpose to mislead a public official in

another person empowered to administer oaths.
      (7)   The statement is in writing on or in connection with a report or

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in connection with the purchase of a

2923.1213.
      (15)   The statement is required under Ohio R.C. 5743.71 in connection
with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery

   (b)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or

defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of

designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.15 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that §
618.15 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part
of the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability

division (l)(4), (l)(5), or (l)(7) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer's education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,

benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the

of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

the basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests

given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.

agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of

value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or

established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case

fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.

clearly indicates a different meaning:
   (a)   “A-weighted sound level” means the sound level in decibels as measured
with the A-weighting network on a sound level meter meeting the standards set
forth in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) SI.4-1983 or its

using the “C” weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards
as set forth in ANSI SI.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dBC.
The “C” weighting network is more sensitive to low frequencies than the “A”
weighting network.
   (d)   “Continuous sound” means any sound with a duration of more than one
second, as measured with a sound level meter set to the “slow” meter response.
   (e)   “Decibel” means a logarithmic (dimensionless) unit of measure often
used in describing the amplitude of sound. Decibel is denoted as dB.
    (f)   “Dwelling unit” means any building, boat or watercraft lawfully
occupied in whole or in part as the temporary or permanent residence of one or
more natural persons.
   (g)   “Extraneous sound” means a sound of high intensity and relatively
short duration which is neither part of the ambient sound, nor comes from the
sound source under investigation.
   (h)   “Impulsive sound” means a sound that has a duration of less than one
second and comes from the sound source under investigation.
   (i)   “Mechanical device” means any device that transmits or modifies
energy.
   (j)   “Noise” means, for the purposes of this chapter, any sound that is in
violation of any provision of this chapter.
   (k)   “Noise disturbance” means any sound which is unreasonably loud,
raucous, or jarring to reasonable persons of ordinary sensibilities, or any
sound which affects the health, safety, or welfare of other persons, or exceeds
the noise levels as defined in Section 648.11.
   (l)   “Plainly audible” means any sound that can be detected by a person

instruction permits specified in division (d)(1) of this section, the court in
its discretion may choose not to impose the suspension, revocation or denial

instead may require the offender to perform community service for a number of
hours determined by the court.

698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
         (ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;

division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02,
         753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the
following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 666.99 and 698.03 of this Code
or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
         (ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
         (ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential

is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
         (ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County’s General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment, the victim,
private provider, state, or political subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section 698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst
forms of the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior
sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the longest
jail term is necessary to deter the offender from committing a future criminal
offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

thereof in the chapter wherein the trade, business or profession is regulated.

days of receiving a supplemental submission, that the application remains
incomplete and identifies which items specified in the original notice of
incompleteness are still missing. Timely notice by the Village of the
deficiencies in a supplemental submission tolls the time period set forth in
subsection (a) until the applicant supplies the specified information.
   (c)   The timeframes set out in subsection (a) may be tolled by mutual
agreement between the applicant and the Village. The timeframes in subsections
(a)(2) and (a)(3) may also be tolled as follows, except that where an applicant
has indicated that the application is for a small wireless facility, the
provisions of subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) below do not apply:

day period, then the Village may toll for an additional fifteen days for every
fifteen applications received, up to a maximum tolling period of ninety days,

reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner.
   (e)   If a request for consent is denied, the Village shall provide, in
writing, its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably discriminate
against the applicant. Grounds for denying an application may include, but are

1042.06 TOWNSHIP IMPROVEMENT AREA 1 CAPITAL COST SURCHARGE.
   (a)   Generally.
      (1)   No person, business, corporation, public agency, partnership, or
association whatsoever located in the South Bass Island Water Improvement
Project Area, and served or to be served by a connection to the water system,
shall connect, or cause to be connected, any building or other structure,
either directly or indirectly, without first paying to the Village, or having
assessed by Ottawa County, in addition to other charges provided for by the
ordinances of the Village, a capital cost surcharge calculated by multiplying
the base rate of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two dollars ($1,872.00)
by the equivalent dwelling units (E.D.U.s) the parcel/lot is assigned, or
anticipated to be assigned, as of the date of assessment, or the date of
application for connection to the water system.
      (2)   Commencing June 1, 2011, the base rate for the water system
connection impact charge shall be three thousand dollars ($3,000) per
residential equivalent dwelling unit, until December 31, 2011. Commencing
January 1, 2012, the base rate for the water system connection impact charge
shall be adjusted by the Engineering News Record (ENR) construction cost
multiplier published for January of each year, and the base rate as so
increased shall be the base rate per E.D.U. applicable for that year.
   (b)   Dwelling Unit Equivalency Factors. The equivalency factors set forth
below shall form the basis for calculating the capital cost surcharge for a
property. The equivalency factors are based upon the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency suggested flow guide and are computed on the basis of the
probable demand a user places on the public water system. The probable flow
rate demand is correlated to the demand expected by a single-family dwelling by
the use of the equivalency factors shown below. The minimum equivalency factor
that shall be met is one when computing fees and charges, unless one E.D.U.
already exists on the property. Equivalency factors for types of uses not
listed shall be determined by the Village Administrator, by the use of accepted
engineering practices on the basis of anticipated flows for the property.

   (a)   In addition to other charges provided for in the Village ordinances,
the Village Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to collect a water
system connection impact charge in the amount established by division (b) of
this section. The amount of the connection impact charge shall be based on the
number of residential units assigned to a connection for a residential use, and
a multiple of such amount for non-residential properties based upon the unit
equivalency factors established by Section
1046.06(b) and based upon the same procedure established in Section
1042.06. The water system connection impact charge shall be paid at the time of
application for a water connection permit.
   (b)   As of January 1, 2024, the base rate charge for the water system
connection impact charge shall be three thousand four hundred fifty dollars
($3,450.00) per residential unit equivalent until December 1, 2024. Commencing
January 1, 2025, the base rate charge for the water system connection impact
charge shall be three thousand nine hundred sixty-seven dollars and fifty cents
($3,967.50) per residential unit equivalent until December 31, 2025. Commencing
January 1, 2026, the base rate for the water system connection impact charge
shall be four thousand five hundred sixty-two dollars ($4,562.50) per
residential equivalent unit, until December 31, 2026. Commencing January 1,
2027, the base rate for the water system connection impact charge shall be five
thousand two hundred forty-six dollars ($5,246.00) per residential unit
equivalent until December 31, 2027. Effective January 1, 2028, the base rate
for the water system connection impact charge be the rate in effect in 2027,
adjusted by the Engineering News Record (ENR) construction multiplier published
for January 1, 2028. Commencing January 1, 2029 and on January 1 for each year
thereafter, the rate in existence shall be adjusted by the ENR construction
multiplier published for the respective year.
   (c)   Water connection impact charges. Water connection impact charges
collected shall be placed in the Water Improvement Fund, and shall be used for
capital improvements that will benefit the entire utility, that will have a
life expectancy of at least five years, and that will have a cost greater than
two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). The Water Improvement Fund shall also be used
to pay a portion of the cost of the expansion of the water treatment plant and/
or water distribution system, including, but not limited to, engineering fees,
legal fees, debt service, and water impact charge survey costs.

1042.08 DETERMINATION OF WATER IMPACT CHARGES; ADDITIONAL IMPACT CHARGE.
   (a)   Authorization of Survey. The Village Administrator is hereby
authorized and directed to publish notice requesting bids for the purpose of
conducting a re-evaluation survey as needed, but no more than three years from
the previous survey, for establishing the unit equivalent of each business
connected to the Village water system. The Village Administrator is directed to
take competitive bids and to enter into a contract with the lowest and best
bidder pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.141. Pursuant to such section, the Village
Administrator will proceed only with the advice and consent of Council by way
of separate ordinance if the total cost of said contract is in excess of
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). Said contract shall be prepared by
the Village Solicitor and shall contain such necessary provisions as determined
by him or her.
   (b)   Determination of Charges. Pursuant to the survey authorized by
division (a) hereof, any property connected to the water distribution system
and any business which has expanded, or will expand in the future, will be
charged an additional water connection impact charge for the increase in unit
equivalents at the applicable base rate as determined in Sections
1042.06 and
1042.07 for the year of the survey. If any user of the Village water
distribution system increases their use on the water system or increases the
consumption of water from the connected property by changing or increasing the
use of the property as previously connected to the water system, the user of
the water system, or the property owner shall pay to the Village an additional
water connection impact fee equal to the impact fee for the use as
reestablished by the Village equivalency unit factors as set forth in Section
1046.04(d), minus any water impact fee previously paid. The additional impact
fee shall be paid to the Village by the property owner prior to the use of the
water system by the new increased use from the property. If the additional
impact fee is not timely paid by the user or property owner, the Village may
disconnect the user or property from the water system, or may bring an
appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount
for the impact fee, or it may file a lien on the property. The owner of any lot
subject to a water impact fee shall be primarily liable to the Village for any
charge levied by this section. The Village shall collect and enforce, by way of
lien or any legal means necessary, any amount owed in water impact fees.
   (c)   Appeal Procedure. An owner of a property subject to a water system
connection impact fee shall have the right to appeal the application and/or the
interpretation of the water impact fee to Council. The owner, subject to the
water system connection impact fee, within 30 days from the date that the water
impact bill is sent, shall file a request for a hearing, in writing, with the
Fiscal Officer. The hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days from the receipt
of the request by the Fiscal Officer and may be at a regularly scheduled
Council meeting or a special meeting called for that purpose. Council may
affirm or modify the water system connection impact fee. Such decision shall be
rendered within 30 days of the hearing.
(Ord. 888-06. Passed 7-10-06; Ord. 1016-11. Passed 5-9-11.)
1042.09 ADDITIONAL WATER IMPACT CHARGE APPLICABLE TO OUTSIDE CUSTOMERS.
   There is hereby established an additional surcharge on all water impact
charges collected from water service customers located outside of the
boundaries of the Village. The surcharge shall be in the amount of 50% above
the water impact charge as established by Section
1042.07. The surcharge shall be added to and collected with the water impact
charge imposed for the connection to the Village water system.
(Ord. 888-06. Passed 7-10-06.)
1042.10 FEES FOR APPROVAL OF WATER LINE EXTENSION APPLICATION AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   When any private entity, including developer(s), individual(s),
association(s), or any other private or public entity submits its engineering
plans for extension of Village water service, each application for the
extension of a water line shall be accompanied by a fee of five hundred dollars
($500.00), as a minimum deposit charge, to reimburse the Village for the costs
incurred in reviewing the plans to determine that the specifications and
materials used in the construction of the water line extension meet the
requirements of the Village, for making studies necessary to determine the
effect of such extension upon the waterworks system in service, and the
engineering feasibility for the requested extension. The five hundred dollar
($500.00) deposit shall be a minimum fee, and the entity/developer shall
reimburse the Village for all plan review and inspection costs incurred by the
Village on an extension project.
   (b)   When final plan approval has been determined, the Village
Administrator shall calculate all plan review and inspection costs incurred, or
to be incurred, by the Village and the entity/developer shall pay the amount as
calculated by the Village Administrator to the Village at the time final
construction approval is granted. Any overrun in plan review/inspection costs
incurred by the Village over the amount calculated by the Village Administrator
shall be billed to and paid by the entity/developer upon final construction of
the water line. No water shall be supplied to the water line extension, or tap-
in permit issued, until all fees required to be paid by any Village ordinance
have been paid to the Village.
   (c)   If the total plan review/inspection costs incurred by the Village are
less than the amount calculated by the Village Administrator, the Village shall
refund the difference to the entity/developer as soon as reasonably possible
after final construction approval of the water line extension.
(Ord. 891-06. Passed 9-11-06.)
1042.11 INCREASE IN IMPACT CHARGE.
   If any user of the Village water system increases the use on the system or
increases the demand on the system by changing the use of the connected
premises, and/or by increasing the demand arising from the premises by
increasing the unit equivalency factors applicable to the connected premises,
the user or property owner shall report the increase in use or increase in
demand to the Village Administrator within ten days, and the user or the
property owner shall immediately pay to the Village an increase in impact
charge equal to the impact charge the for the increased use as established by
the Village Administrator, minus any impact charge previously paid for the
premises. The impact charge shall be paid to the Village prior to the use of
the water system of the increased use of the premises. If the increased impact
charge is not paid by the user or property owner prior to the use of the water
system, the Village may disconnect the user or property owner from the water
system or may bring an appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction
to collect the amount of the impact charge due.
(Ord. 926-07. Passed 1-14-08.)
1042.12 LATE CHARGES, OTHER FEES, AND ASSESSMENTS OF DELINQUENT WATER BILLS.
   (a)   The Village shall assess a delinquent rate of 10% of the total monthly
water utility bill for those bills paid after the due date.
   (b)   In March of each year the Village Administrator shall present to
Council all water utility accounts four months or more delinquent. Upon Council
approval, the Village Administrator shall present the delinquent amounts due to
the County Auditor to be assessed to the tax duplicate in accordance with law.
   (c)   All charges for water usage as provided in the Village Ordinances are
assessed against the property to which the service is rendered and are a lien
against said property, collectible the same as other liens and taxes. Transfer
of ownership of property connected to a public water system shall not relieve
the property owner of responsibility for charges assessed against the property.
   (d)   Any Village water utility account established and maintained in the
name of the tenant, lessee or other person or party for services provided to
the premises shall not relieve the property or the owner of the property for
liability for such charges.

Village Administrator, shall not be limited to, the nature of the process, the
volume, rates of flow, the mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of
operation, concentrations of controlled pollutants, or other information which
relates to the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they
are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the Village
Administrator may require information in the form of self-monitoring reports.
   (b)   Records and Monitoring; Control Manholes; Volume Determination.
      (1)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations, as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and any applicable State or Federal pretreatment
standards or requirements.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the Village
Administrator. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data, indicating the
industrial user's compliance with this chapter, shall be prepared as requested
and submitted to the Village Administrator.
      (3)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install, at his or her own cost and
expense, suitable control manholes or access points and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Village Administrator.
      (4)   The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption of the person except as herein provided
in this paragraph.
         If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
procures any part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than a
metered, public water system, all or part of which is discharged into the
public sewer, the person shall install and maintain, at his or her expense,
water meters of a type approved by the Engineer for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from those other sources. Access to these meters
shall be made available to representatives of the Village at any reasonable
time. The accuracy of said meters shall be verified at the discharger's expense
on a once per two-year basis at a minimum or, at the request of the Village
Administrator, by an independent testing company.
         The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers may
install and maintain, at his or her expense, metering devices for determining
the volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial waste surcharge will be computed. The measuring devices shall be of
a type acceptable to the Engineer.
         The Engineer may require the installation of devices for measuring the
volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records. Any metering device for determining the
volume of waste discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned and
maintained by the person responsible for its discharge. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Engineer.
      (5)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Village Administrator
may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area, with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such
street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public
utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Village Administrator's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Inspections, Sampling and Analysis.
      (1)   Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to
Section
1044.03 prohibitions and limitations may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a twenty-four hour period, or over a longer or
shorter time span, as determined necessary by the Village Administrator to meet
the needs of specific circumstances.
      (2)   Sampling and monitoring. Industrial wastes discharged into the
public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be made as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer, but in no case shall less
than two twenty-four hour composite samples per month be taken. The owner shall
be responsible for the collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
      Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of
the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of
automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples. Access to
sampling locations shall be granted to the Engineer or his or her authorized
representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of
samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the times
the same were taken.
      (3)   Analysis of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analysis of
industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in accordance with the current
edition of Standard Methods or Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and
Waste, published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Analyses of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the State Environmental Protection Agency.
However, alternative methods for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be
used subject to mutual agreement between the Engineer and the person
responsible for their discharge. Determination of the character and
concentration of the industrial wastes shall be made by the person responsible
for the discharge, or his or her qualified agent as approved by the Engineer.
The results of the analyses shall be reported to the Village on a monthly basis
on forms provided by the Village. The Village shall make its own analyses of
the wastes, and these determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges,
except under circumstances set forth in the following paragraph.
      In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own samples. The
results of the analyses of the samples collected by the Village and the
industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the
latest edition of Standard Methods, and the differences shall be negotiated.

1044.20   LOW PRESSURE SEWER SYSTEM: CONDITIONS OF SERVICE; CONTRACTORS;
PERMITS; COSTS; AND BILLING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Agreement. All persons, successors, and assigns obtaining a permit
from the Village Administrator accept and agree to be bound by the Village's
rules, regulations, standards, and specifications.
   (b)   Contractor Requirements.
      (1)   Authorized contractors. Only persons, firms, companies, or
corporations approved by the Village Administrator or the Administrator's
authorized agent, shall be permitted to construct or repair private building
sanitary sewers, private collection sewers, or sanitary sewer improvements
installed by private developers to be dedicated to the Village for public
ownership, operations, and maintenance. Persons, firms, companies, or
corporations constructing or repairing private building sewers, private
collection systems, or sanitary sewer improvements installed by a private
developer to be dedicated to the Village for public ownership, operations, and
maintenance shall obtain pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) hereof a yearly business
license and shall also furnish a performance guarantee in favor of the Village
on forms provided by the Village Administrator.
      (2)   Business license. The property owner's contractor must have a
current, valid business license to conduct business in the Village and shall be
required to operate and construct and install sanitary sewer improvements in
conformance with the Village's standards and specifications. A Village business
license can be obtained as set forth in Chapter 802 of the Village's Codified
Ordinances.
      (3)   Safety standards. All contractors working on the Village of Put-in-
Bay wastewater treatment and collection systems, its appurtenances, public or
private, connected to said treatment and collection system under the Rules,
Regulations, Standards, and Specifications shall work in accordance with all
applicable O.S.H.A. safety standards.
   (c)   Permits and Costs.
      (1)   Permits shall be valid for 180 days from the date of issuance. The
expiration date of the permit shall be noted on the permit issued. If a permit
expires and work has not been completed, all work shall be stopped by the
Village Administrator or the Administrator's authorized agent and the property
owner or agent shall be required to complete an application for permit renewal
obtained from the Village Administrator or the Administrator's authorized agent
and submit it along with a permit renewal fee and any other applicable
equalization fees and charges.
      (2)   A repair permit shall be required prior to making any repairs or
replacements associated with private building sewers, private grinder pumps,
private collection sewers, or other appurtenances, as approved by the Village
Administrator. Upon completion of any repairs/ replacements the work shall be
documented by returning the completed repair permit to the Village
Administrator for filing.
      (3)   Permits shall be available on the job site at all times until the
job is completed and approved.
      (4)   The issuance of a permit, by the Village Administrator or the
Administrator's authorized agent, to connect or repair does not relieve the
permit holder of the responsibility of securing permits from other applicable
governmental or private agencies for the permission to work in public or
private rights-of-way or easement areas, (i.e. Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency, Ottawa County Health Department, Ottawa County Sanitary Engineer,
Ottawa County Engineer, Put-in-Bay Township Trustees, etc.)
      (5)   Costs. All costs and expense incidental to the installation and
connection of building sewers and appurtenances shall be borne by the owner(s).
The owner(s) shall indemnify the Village from any loss or damage that may
directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of a private building
sewer or appurtenance.
   (d)   Initial and Final Sewer Billing Procedure. The following sewer billing
procedure establishes how the initial and final sanitary sewer billing date
shall be determined by the Village Administrator or the Administrator's
authorized agent:
      (1)   Properties connected to a public pressure sewer via a private
grinder pump. When a structure's new private building sewer gains access to a
public pressure sewer main via a private grinder pump, sewer billing shall
commence on the date that the pump core is installed, the electrical connection
is completed, and the pump is turned on and tested. The Village Administrator
or the Administrator's authorized agent shall file a report to be signed and
dated on the day the private grinder pump becomes operational. The signed
permit shall then be submitted to the Utilities Department for processing of
the new billing.
            In situations where a property owner is already being served by a
private grinder pump and has requested that sewer billing be permanently
discontinued, the Village will oversee removal of the private grinder pump core
and installation of a plug or cap into the inlet pipe in the private grinder
pump to eliminate service to the structure. In the event the property
disconnecting from the sanitary sewer is connected to a private grinder pump
with another property owner, the private building sewer for the property being
disconnected must also be permanently capped as described in the gravity sewer
service section referenced below. Also, proper arrangement must be made by the
property owner(s) to relocate the grinder pump electrical supply at his
expense, if applicable. An inspection of the structure, and private building
sewer if necessary, must be performed by the Village Administrator or the
Administrator's authorized agent to confirm that wastewater is, and can, no
longer be generated within the structure being disconnected. On the same day of
the inspection, the private grinder pump core shall be removed from the wet
well, if possible, and placed in storage by the property owner. A properly
completed and signed Administrator's Report form shall be submitted to the
Utilities Department to deactivate billing to the property being disconnected
as of the recorded date of compliance with the above requirements.
      (2)   Properties connected to a public gravity sanitary sewer main. When
a structure is served by a public gravity sanitary sewer main and private
building sewer, billing shall commence on the date that the final inspection
report identifies:
         A.   The private building sewer has passed the testing and inspection;
and
         B.   Verification has been made that sanitary sewer service has
actually begun.
      (3)   Variance. If a property owner or developer is constructing a "new"
wastewater generating structure and is installing the private building sewer in
the early stages of construction, the Village Administrator shall advise the
property owner that the sewer billing may be postponed until such time that
sewer service is actually available to a structure. The Village Administrator
or the Administrator's authorized agent shall advise the property owner of the
Village's billing policy and request that the property owner sign a special
form provided by the Village Administrator or the Administrator's authorized
agent. The form is a simple agreement allowing the postponement of the billing.
A temporary plug must be installed in the private building sewer with a sticker
or marking by the Village Administrator or the Administrator's authorized agent
to resist tampering with the plug. A copy of the form must be attached to the
Village Administrator's permit copy so it is known not to turn in the permit
until "final" connection is made starting sanitary sewer service. If the plug
is tampered with or the property owner fails to notify the Village
Administrator or the Administrator's authorized agent of final connection to
the public sanitary sewer, billing shall begin from the original inspection
date of the installation of the private building sewer.
            In situations where a property owner is already connected to a
public gravity sanitary sewer and requests that sewer billing be permanently
discontinued, the property owner shall obtain a permit to permanently cap the
private building sewer at the right-of-way. The Village Administrator or the
Administrator's authorized agent must witness the installation of the private
building sewer cap. The property owner shall obtain a repair permit from the
Village prior to reconnection to the public sanitary sewer. Upon completion of
the service disconnection, the Administrator shall submit a report to the
Fiscal Officer confirming compliance with this regulation and the date
completed. The Fiscal Officer shall terminate sewer billing as of the date
specified.
            In the event of a catastrophic event (i.e. fire, flood, tornado...)
that severely damages or destroys a wastewater generating structure, the
Village will, upon written request from the property owner, will issue a repair
permit at no cost, shut off the public water service (if applicable) and
discontinue sanitary sewer billing until such time that a new structure is
built. The discontinuation of sanitary sewer service and billing shall be
handled in one of the following methods:
         A.   If the property owner indicates that they do not intend to
rebuild the structure, the property owner will be required to dig up and cap
the private building sewer at the road right-of-way line (property line).
         B.   If the property owner indicates that they will be rebuilding the
structure, the property owner shall cap the private building sewer or drain at
a location that is convenient on the property. If the property is served by
Village water, shut off and turn on of the water meter will determine the
amount of time that sanitary sewer billing is discontinued.
            If at any time the Village determines that the public sanitary
sewer is being used by the property after billing has been discontinued,
billing shall resume and the property owner will be back-billed from the date
the billing was discontinued.
      (4)   Re-establish service. To re-establish sanitary sewer service to a
property that was connected to the public sanitary sewer at a previous point in
time and then disconnected (monthly user charge terminated) under the above
referenced policy, the property owner shall:
         A.   Secure a repair permit to re-establish service from the Village
Administrator or the Administrator's authorized agent. The standard repair
permit fee shall be waived for catastrophic events that severely damage or
destroy a structure to the point of being uninhabitable.
         B.   Pay a permit fee and a re-establishment fee that is equal to the
sum of twelve monthly user charges (at the current monthly rate), per
equivalent dwelling unit being re-established. Fees are waived for properties
re-establishing their service after a catastrophic event impacting the
structure. If a property owner does not use any water (zero consumption
registered through the water meter) for a minimum of twelve consecutive months,
and has continued to pay the monthly sanitary sewer bill for the same twelve
consecutive month period, a re-establishment fee (as defined above) will not be
required.
               If a public water meter is not available to confirm zero
consumption was registered on the meter for a minimum twelve consecutive month
period, the property owner may instead submit copies of their electric bills
for the same consecutive twelve month period to confirm that the structure was
not inhabited.
         C.   The property owner shall expose the permanent private building
sewer cap and have the Village Administrator or the Administrator's authorized
agent verify that it has not been tampered with or used since disconnection. If
evidence shows that the cap has been tampered with or this procedure was not
followed and connection has already taken place, the current property owner
shall be billed the total monthly user charges from the date "final" inspection
was made to discontinue billing on the structure to the current month.
(Ord. 1225-19. Passed 10-9-19.)
1044.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person who is found to have violated an order of the Village
hearing authority, or who willfully or negligently fails to comply with any
provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules and regulations issued
hereunder, shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each offense, but in no case shall the costs

1046.01 TAP-IN FEES.
   (a)   Each user shall acquire a sewer tap-in permit from the Village prior
to tapping the system. The permit fee shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00),
plus an inspection fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The user's tap-in fee
will also include an assessment fee per the schedule set forth in division (b)
of this section. The user is responsible for construction costs to tap into the
sewer. Any person installing a new or replacing an old tap-in without a permit
shall be subject to the penalty provided in Section
1046.99. Written plans for sewer tap-ins shall accompany the user's tap-in
permit application.
   (b)   Fees for new building connections to the Village sewers shall be in
accordance with the following:
      (1)   All units assessed for the original sanitary improvements: N/A.
      (2)   All fees shall be based on the approved unit equivalents set forth
in Section
1046.04.
      (3)   The base charge shall be one thousand sixty-five dollars
($1,065.00) per unit. (One unit equals 400 gpd or a single-family residence
equivalent.)

1046.03 ASSESSMENTS FOR CORNER LOT INSTALLATIONS.
   (a)   All subsequent installation of sewer lines within the Village shall be
assessed for corner lots on the following basis: the front footage of said
property shall be assessed for said installations at 100% of the front footage
costs thereof, and the side lot assessment shall be assessed at 33-1/3% for the
first 150 feet and the full assessment after 150 feet.
   (b)   The distinction between front footage and side footage shall be based
upon a determination by the Village as to which street the primary structure on
said premises faces. If the property is an unapproved lot, it shall be
determined that the front footage shall be on the main street and the side
footage on the secondary street.
(Ord. 566. Passed 7-11-91.)
1046.04 SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing for the cost of the management,
maintenance, operation and repair of the sewerage system and the sewage
pumping, treatment and disposal works there is hereby levied and assessed upon
each lot or parcel of land in the Village of Put-in- Bay on which a commercial,
industrial, institutional or residential building is located, and which is
connected to the Village of Put-in-Bay sewer system, sewer service charges as
hereinafter provided. All classes of users shall be levied charges on the same
basis as described hereinafter.
   (b)   The charge for operation, maintenance and replacement (OM&R) shall be
calculated on the volume of wastewater discharged directly or indirectly into
the sewage system and shall be measured by the water used by each sewer user as
shown by the water meter readings. The sewer service charge for residents of
Put-in-Bay shall consist of a debt service charge of nine dollars and sixty
cents ($9.60) per month, per unit, and a user charge for OM&R of 90% of the
user's applicable water bill. A minimum monthly charge of 90% of the minimum of
the user's applicable water bill shall be paid by all users of the system
regardless of actual usage readings, which shall be used for fixed expenses.
Residents paying the debt service charge in advance shall be assessed the OM&R
user charge.
   (c)   (1)   The service charge shall be calculated on the volume of
wastewater discharged directly or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system
and shall be calculated by one of two methods. The specific method of service
charge calculation shall be determined on an individual "per user" basis by the
Village Engineer.
      (2)   Both methods of service charge calculation shall be related to the
concept of unit equivalent charges, which shall be based on the specific use of
each specific property connected to the sanitary system. For the purpose of
this chapter, one unit shall be equivalent to one single-family dwelling and
also to 400 gallons per day of sanitary flow, which shall be based on a
Village-approved water or sewage individual user metering installation. The use
of a connected property shall be determined by the Village Administrator in
accordance with local zoning requirements, building codes and health
regulations and will be subject to occasional re-evaluation if a change in
property use occurs due to remodeling, new construction, change of ownership or
other possible usage change, or at the instance of the Village Administrator or
Village Council.
   (d)   The equivalency factors set forth below shall form the basis for
calculating the service charge for a property. The equivalency factors are
based upon the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency suggested flow guide and
are computed on the basis of the probable demand a user places on the public
water system. The probable flow rate demand is correlated to the demand
expected by a single-family dwelling by the use of the equivalency factors
shown below. The minimum equivalency factor that shall be met is one when
computing fees and charges, unless one E.D.U. already exists on the property.
Equivalency factors for types of uses not listed shall be determined by the
Village Administrator, by the use of accepted engineering practices on the
basis of anticipated flows for the property.

**   If a person owns a mobile home (trailer) or recreational vehicle (travel
trailer) and a dock space simultaneously within the same subdivision or
parcel of land, that person’s E.D.U. shall be based upon a mobile home or
R.V. only.
 
   (e)   (1)   User types not included in the table provided in division (d)
hereof shall be evaluated on a case by case basis by the Village Engineer, who
shall establish a unit equivalent determination for these special cases. Also,
based upon actual experience of operation of the district's sewerage system and
actual water and sewage flow data from the users of the system, the Village
reserves the right to make justified adjustments to the table of unit
equivalents or the unit flow contribution figure provided previously in order
to assure equitable service charges to users of the system. Any user with a
unit equivalent calculated to be less than one unit shall receive a one unit
rating as a minimum unit equivalent rating for user charge consideration.
      (2)   Therefore, the sewer service charge of users of the Village
sewerage facilities shall consist of a debt service charge of nine dollars and
sixty cents ($9.60) per unit per month and/or a user charge for operation,
maintenance and replacement costs of 90% of the user's applicable water bill
(water or sewage). For unmetered water or wastewater sources, the sewage volume
used for service charge calculations shall be calculated by taking the unit
equivalency rating of the subject property, as determined by the Village
Engineer per the previous divisions, multiplied by 400 gallons per day per unit
equivalent. The service charges for these unmetered units shall be calculated
by applying the same debt service charge and user charge values cited
previously in this subsection to the resulting estimated sewage flow volume
generated by the preceding unit flow calculations.
   (f)   The sewer service charge system will be audited annually by the
Village with the charges being adjusted upwards or downwards in order to assure
that the system is and will continue to be self-sufficient and that sufficient
revenue is being generated from each user class in the proper proportions. No
free service shall be provided in this service charge system. Each user will be
notified by the Village, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill,
of the rates for that year and of the portion of the service charges
attributable to the user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement of
the system. In addition, rates will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly to
compensate users of each class for any overpayment and underpayment accumulated
during the previous rate period.
   (g)   The sewer service charge herein assessed shall be in addition to the
charge made for water used.
   (h)   Where a private water supply is used, the sewer service charge may be
calculated by requiring the property owner to meter the private water supply,
such metering to be at the property owner's expense and such measurement to be
used in the same manner as a public water meter in determining the charge. Each
residence, institution and commercial or industrial establishment shall be
subject to a separate sewer user charge even though such establishment may be
served by a sewer connection common to other premises. If it is found by any
citizen that the water or waste measured or metered for any customer is greater
than that actually being discharged directly or indirectly into the sewage
system, the Village may modify and adjust such volume in accordance with the
facts and with justice and equity, but shall not charge less than the minimum
for any customer subject to the sewer charge.
   (i)   Where a private water supply is used and/or the user desires to meter
his or her water use or sewage flow, the owner shall incur all expenses related
to the installation of said meter. Prior to installation of the meter, the type
of equipment installed and its location must be approved by the Village. Prior
to placing said meter into use after installation, the Village shall inspect
and approve the meter installation. Any modifications required by the Village
shall be made at the user's expense and prior to the meter's use. The meter
shall be located in a suitable location that will accommodate readings by
Village personnel. Tampering with the meter by the user to cause inaccurate
readings shall make the user subject to the penalty provided in Section
1046.99.
   (j)   Industrial waste water released into the public sewers as determined
by this chapter shall be subject to surcharges determined monthly on the basis
of the following formula:
   P equals (A) x B.O.D. plus (B) x SS where A = $ per lb. BOD/yr. and B = $
per lb. SS/yr.
P equals the monthly surcharge.
BOD equals pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per month in excess of 300 mg/
l concentration in the wastewater.
SS equals pounds of suspended solids per month in excess of 300 mg/
l concentration.
   (1)   In the above formula, A and B refer to the total expenditures per
pound of BOD and suspended solids, respectively, to collect, convey and treat
the wastewater, which shall be determined annually by the Village.
   (2)   Industrial cost recovery will be established, if an industrial user
begins discharging, in accordance with CFR 35.928, or the latest revisions
thereto, if determined applicable.

1046.05 INDIRECT SERVICE FEE.
   Any person who indirectly generates flow but who has no direct connection to
the system shall pay an indirect service fee which may or may not equal his or
her direct assessment fee. If an indirect user connects to the sewer system,
the total indirect service fee shall be applied to his or her total direct
assessment fee and the balance will be charged.
(Ord. 472. Passed 4-12-84.)
1046.06 APPLICABILITY OF RENTAL CHARGES.
   (a)   Where a sewer is available, it will be presumed that the waste from
the premises either will be discharged directly or indirectly into the sewerage
system and that the property will be subject to the current sewer rental
charges.
   (b)   Where premises are not served directly or indirectly by the sewerage
system and should be exempt from the sewer rental charge, it will be the
responsibility of the property owner or other interested party to notify the
Village of said claim for exemption. All lots, lands, buildings or premises
owned by Put-in-Bay, Ohio, within the Village, shall be subject to the sewer
rental charge as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 449. Passed 4-4-83.)
1046.07 PAYMENT OF CHARGES AND RENTALS.
   The owner of each lot, land or premises connected to the sanitary or
combined sewer system of the Village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, or having such
connection available, shall, as well as the lessee of such lot, land or
premises, be liable to the Village of Put-in-Bay for any charge or rental
levied by this chapter. All charges and rentals shall be collected by the
Village of Put-in-Bay, which Village shall make and enforce such bylaws, rules
and regulations as may be deemed necessary.
(Ord. 449. Passed 4-4-83.)
1046.08 SEWER REVENUE FUND.
   The funds received from the collection of the charges and rentals provided
for in this chapter shall be deposited as received with the Clerk-Treasurer,
who shall keep the same in a separate fund designated as the Sewer Revenue
Fund. Subject to the provisions of any ordinance or indenture of mortgage
authorizing the issuance of, and securing mortgage revenue bonds for, the sewer
system, moneys in the Sewer Revenue Fund shall be used for the payment of the
cost and expense of operation, maintenance, repair and management of the sewer
system and for the payment of debt and other charges on bonds issued for the
improvements of, and extensions to, the sewer system. Any surplus in the Sewer
Revenue Fund over and above the requirements hereinbefore mentioned may be used
for the enlargement of, and replacements to, the sewer system and any parts
thereof, or for any other lawful purpose.
(Ord. 404. Passed 5-14-70.)
1046.09 VILLAGE SEWER IMPACT FEE.
   In addition to other charges provided for in this chapter, every property
which is permitted to connect to the Village public sewer system shall be
subject to a Village public sewer system impact fee in the amount established
in Section
1046.10(c) for each residential unit connected, and a multiple of such amount
for non-residential properties based upon the same unit equivalency factors
fixed for rates paid for the use of the sanitary sewer system.
(Ord. 882-06. Passed 11-13-06.)
1046.10 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES.
   (a)   Authorization of Survey. The Village Administrator is hereby
authorized to publish notice requesting bids for the purpose of conducting a
re-evaluation survey as needed, but no more than three years from the previous
survey, for establishing the unit equivalent of each business connected to the
Village sewer system. The Village Administrator is directed to take competitive
bids and to enter into a contract with the lowest and best bidder pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 731.141. Pursuant to such section, the Village Administrator will
proceed only with the advice and consent of Council by way of separate
ordinance if the total cost of said contract is in excess of twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000.00). Said contract shall be prepared by the Village
Solicitor and shall contain such necessary provisions as determined by him or
her.
   (b)   Determination of Charges. Pursuant to the survey authorized by
division (a) hereof, any property connected to the sewer system and any
business which has expanded or will expand in the future will be charged an
additional sewer impact fee for the increase in unit equivalents at the
applicable base rate as determined in division (c) hereof for the year of the
survey. If any user of the Village sewer system increases their use of the
sewer system or increases the discharge from the connected property by changing
or increasing the use of the property as previously connected to the sewer
system, the user or property owner shall pay to the Village an additional
impact fee equal to the impact fee for the use as reestablished by the Village
equivalency unit factors as set forth in Section
1046.04, minus any connection impact fee previously paid. The additional impact
fee shall be paid to the Village by the property owner prior to the use of the
sewer system by the new increased use from the property. If the additional
impact fee is not timely paid by the user or property owner, the Village may
disconnect the user or property owner from the sewer system, or may bring an
appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount
for the impact fee, or it may file a lien on the property. The owner of any lot
subject to a sewer impact fee shall be primarily liable to the Village for any
charge levied by this section. The Village shall collect and enforce, by way of
lien or any legal means necessary, any amount owed in sewer impact fees.
   (c)   Determination of Base Rate. The base rate charge for the sewer impact
fees established herein shall be one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two
dollars ($1,872.00) per residential unit equivalent until December 31, 2006.
Commencing January 1, 2007, the base rate for the sewer impact fee shall be two
thousand four hundred and thirty-six dollars ($2,436.00), per residential unit
equivalent until December 31, 2007. Commencing January 1, 2008, the base rate
for the sewer impact fee shall be adjusted to be two thousand five hundred
dollars ($2,500.00) per residential unit equivalent, adjusted by the
Engineering News Record (ENR) construction multiplier published for January of
each year, commencing January 1, 2009.
   (d)   Use of Fees. Sewer impact fees collected shall be placed in the
Capital Improvement Fund established by Ordinance 329, and shall only be used
for capital improvements that will benefit the entire utility, that will have a
life expectancy of at least five years, and that will have a cost greater than
two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). The balance of the Fund shall be utilized to
pay a portion of the expansion of the sewer treatment plant, debt service
payments for expansion of the treatment facilities, engineering fees, legal
fees and sewer impact survey costs.
(Ord. 723-98. Passed 3-11-99.)
   (e)   Payment of Sewer Impact Fees and Monthly Bills.
      (1)   Sewer impact fees shall be billed separately. Payment is due within
90 days of sending the bill. If payment is not received within 90 days, the
amount of the bill will be amortized over 20 years at an interest rate
established by the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) at the time of
billing. This amount shall be included, as a separate line item, in the monthly
bill until paid in full, including interest.
      (2)   Once the amount due is amortized over the 20-year period, any
prepayment therefor shall include the remaining principal balance, together
with any and all accrued interest. Prepayment shall be allowed only until such
time as the Village obligates itself in borrowing revenue to build a new cell,
for modifications to the existing wastewater treatment system, for construction
or modifications to the existing wastewater treatment facility or for the
construction of a new wastewater treatment facility. No prepayment will be
permitted after the Village borrows money for such purposes, except that any
owner may repay if he or she pays the remaining principal balance together with
all interest that has accrued and has not accrued for the total term.
Notification will be sent in a timely manner to persons or businesses who or
which have an outstanding debt if the need for the Village to borrow money for
capital improvements concerning the wastewater treatment system permits those
persons or businesses to prepay the remaining amount due, together with accrued
interest, if they so desire. The interest rate charged to the property owners
shall be changed, when the Village borrows money for the above purposes, to the
interest rate which the Village is obligated to pay under the loan in existence
at the time.
      (3)   Sewer impact fees will be used only in conjunction with the
wastewater treatment facility capital improvements or modifications or the
construction of a new facility.
      (4)   If any monthly sewer bill is not paid within 60 days of sending,
the water service to the building shall be disconnected. The water service will
be reconnected only upon payment, in full, of all utility bills (including
sewer impact fees) past due, together with a reconnection charge as established
by the Village Administrator.
(Ord. 793-00. Passed 10-23-00.)
   (f)   Appeal Procedure. An owner of a property subject to a sewer impact fee
shall have the right to appeal the application and/or the interpretation of the
sewer impact fee to Council. The owner, subject to the sewer impact fee, within
30 days from the date that the sewer impact bill is sent, shall file a request
for a hearing, in writing, with the Fiscal Officer. The hearing shall be
scheduled within 30 days from the receipt of the request by the Fiscal Officer
and may be at a regularly scheduled Council meeting or a special meeting called
for that purpose. Council may affirm or modify the sewer impact fee. Such
decision shall be rendered within 30 days of the hearing.

Passed 5-9-11.)
1046.11 ADDITIONAL FEES APPLICABLE TO OUTSIDE CUSTOMERS.
   There shall be established an administrative fee, which shall be a surcharge
on all monthly water and sewer service fees collected from the outside
customers. Said surcharge shall be in the amount of 60% of the service fees
established in the Codified Ordinances of the Village, including Ordinance 801-
01, being Section
1040.08, and Ordinance 802-01, being Section
1044.19, and such surcharge shall be added to the service fees established in
said sections.
(Ord. 807-02. Passed 3-12-01; Ord. 882-06. Passed 11-13-06; Ord. 1017-11.
Passed 5-9- 11.)
1046.12 FEES FOR APPROVAL OF SEWER LINE EXTENSION APPLICATION AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   When any private entity, including developer(s), individual(s),
association(s), or any other private or public entity submits its engineering
plans for extension of village waste water treatment facilities, each
application for the extension of a sewer line shall be accompanied by a fee of
five hundred dollars ($500.00), as a minimum deposit charge, to reimburse the
Village for the costs incurred in reviewing the plans to determine that the
specifications and materials used in the construction of the sewer line
extension meet the requirements of the Village, for making studies necessary to
determine the effect of such extension upon the waste water works facilities in
service, and the engineering feasibility for the requested extension. The five
hundred dollar ($500.00) deposit shall be a minimum fee, and the entity/
developer shall reimburse the Village for all plan review and inspection costs
incurred by the Village on an extension project.
   (b)   When final plan approval has been determined, the Village
Administrator shall calculate all plan review and inspection costs incurred, or
to be incurred, by the Village and the entity/developer shall pay the amount as
calculated by the Village Administrator to the Village at the time final
construction approval is granted. Any overrun in plan review/inspection costs
incurred by the Village over the amount calculated by the Village Administrator
shall be billed to and paid by the entity/developer upon final construction of
the sewer line. No sewer service shall be supplied to the sewer line extension,
or tap-in permit issued, until all fees required to be paid by any Village
ordinance have been paid to the Village.
   (c)   If the total plan review/inspection costs incurred by the Village are
less than the amount calculated by the Village Administrator, the Village shall
refund the difference to the entity/developer as soon as reasonably possible
after final construction approval of the sewer line extension.
(Ord. 892-06. Passed 11-13-06.)
1046.13 INCREASE IN IMPACT CHARGE.
   If any user of the Village sewer system increases the use on the system or
increases the discharge from his or her premises by changing the use of the
connected premises, and/or by increasing the demand arising from the premises
by increasing the unit equivalency factors applicable to the connected
premises, the user or property owner shall report the increase in use or
increase in demand to the Village Administrator within ten days, and the user
or the property owner shall immediately pay to the Village an increased impact
fee equal to the impact fee for the increased use as established by the Village
Administrator, minus any impact fee previously paid for the premises. The
impact fee shall be paid to the Village prior to the use of the sewer system of
the increased use of the premises. If the increased impact fee is not paid by
the user or property owner prior to the use of the sewer system, the Village
may disconnect the user or property owner from the sewer system or may bring an
appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount
of the impact charge due.
(Ord. 920-07. Passed 12-10-07.)
1046.14 LATE CHARGES, OTHER FEES, AND ASSESSMENTS OF DELINQUENT SEWER BILLS.
   (a)   The Village shall assess a delinquent rate of 10% of the total monthly
sewer utility bill for those bills paid after the due date. In addition, the
Village shall assess a delinquent rate of 2% per month of the total monthly
sewer utility bill for those bills outstanding 30 days beyond the due date,
until such bill is paid.
   (b)   In July of each year the Village Administrator shall present to
Council all sewer user accounts four months or more delinquent. Upon Council
approval, the Village Administrator shall present the delinquent amounts due to
the County Auditor to be assessed to the tax duplicate in accordance with law.
   (c)   All charges for sewer usage as provided in the Village Ordinances are
assessed against the property to which the service is rendered and are a lien
against said property, collectible the same as other liens and taxes. Transfer
of ownership of property connected to a public sewer system shall not relieve
the property owner of responsibility for charges assessed against the property.
   (d)   Any Village sewer utility account established and maintained in the
name of the tenant, lessee or other person or party for services provided to
the premises shall not relieve the property or the owner of the property for
liability for such charges.
   (e)   A return check fee will be charged for any check returned from the
bank unpaid. This fee shall also apply to returned automatic direct bill
payments. The fee amount will be established annually by the Village
Administrator with a minimum charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per item.
(Ord. 997-10. Passed 1-10-11.)
1046.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who is found to have violated an order of the Village hearing
authority, or who willfully or negligently fails to comply with any provisions
of this chapter, and the orders, rules and regulations issued hereunder, shall
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense, but in no case shall the costs be less
than those costs incurred by the Village for reasonable damages or special
expenses, including equipment rental, chemicals, labor, etc., necessary for the
proper operation and maintenance of all wastewater facilities. Each day on
which a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate and distinct
offense. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the Village may recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and any other
expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the person found to
have violated this chapter or the orders, rules and regulations issued
hereunder.

construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of

1442.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. This chapter shall apply to
all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village, as
identified in the Flood Insurance Study-Ottawa County, Ohio (and incorporated
areas) and flood insurance rate maps effective May 18, 2015, including any
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Village.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, the following studies and/or maps
are adopted:
         Flood Insurance Study-Ottawa County, Ohio (and Incorporated Areas) and
Flood Insurance Rate Maps Effective May 18, 2015.
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Put-in-Bay Town Hall, 435 Catawba Avenue,
Put-in-Bay, Ohio 43456.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning or
building codes. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other
ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. This chapter shall not
impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such
interests shall also be governed by the provisions of this chapter.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 1106-15. Passed 5-12-15.)
1442.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   (c)   “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor” see “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” means a the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village's historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in this chapter for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.” For the
purposes of this chapter, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3781.06.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation, are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village's
flood insurance rate map, September 30, 1977, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” means and includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in R.C. § 111.15
as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01
to 4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate
maps, flood insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood
hazard boundary maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

Section 4781.
      3.   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under R.C. Chapter 4906.
      4.   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous Waste
Siting Board under R.C. Chapter 3734.
      5.   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
      6.   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development
permit is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village's flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1442.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.    Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.    Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1442.04(c)(5).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1442.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a conditional letter of map
revision or letter of map revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter
of map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation: and
            2.    Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1442.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)    Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the Village’s flood
insurance rate map accurately represent the Village's boundaries, include
within such notification a copy of a map of the Village suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the Village has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
this chapter.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1442.05 Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
      (1)   After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in this chapter, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1442.03(j)(2);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.    Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.    Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.    Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1442.04(i)(l)B.1. and 3. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of this chapter, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Soil and Water Resources,
must be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.
Evidence of such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1442.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 1106- 15. Passed 5-12-15.)
1442.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission, as established by the Village,
is appointed as the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be
held at the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson.
All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the
Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings
in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
Village Hall.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of this
chapter.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1442.05(d) of this chapter.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 15 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application
for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of this chapter, not
inconsistent with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations, and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site;
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges. Variances shall only be issued upon:
               a.    A showing of good and sufficient cause;
               b.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this
chapter does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
               c.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
               d.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
               e.    A determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         B.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1442.05(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the final decision of the
Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Ottawa County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 1106-15. Passed 5-12-15.)

   The legislative authority of the Village may establish a Planning Commission
of five members, consisting of the Mayor, one member of the legislative
authority, and three citizens of the Village to be appointed by the Mayor, for
terms of six years each, except that the term of one of the members of the
first Commission shall be for four years and one for two years, plus two
alternates. Each alternate shall be appointed by the Mayor for four years,
except that one of the initial alternates will be appointed for two years.
Alternates will be notified in advance of any meeting or hearing where a member
will be absent or where a conflict of interest exists for a regular member that
will require that member's position to be declared vacant. In that event, the
alternate member will attend the hearing and cast a vote as a regular member of
the Commission.
(Ord. 1133-16.  Passed 9-12-16.)
1220.011  QUORUM.

the majority.
   (c)   However, in the event a member of the Planning Commission has a
conflict of interest and is unable to vote due to a violation of the Ohio
Ethics Laws regarding any matter that is before the Commission, that member's
seat or those members' seats on the Commission shall be deemed to be vacant for
purposes of that vote. In that event, the majority shall be reconfigured to
reflect the fact that the member's seat or those members' seats having a
conflict of interest are deemed to be vacant and the concurring votes of the
remaining members who are eligible to vote shall be counted to reflect a simple
majority of the reconfigured majority.
(Ord. 1133-16.  Passed 9-12-16.)

1260.03  AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Authority.  All provisions of current laws of the State of Ohio
pertaining to municipal corporations shall be complied with.  Whenever the

or hereafter established by this zoning code, amend the text of the zoning
code, or amend the zoning map.
   (b)   Initiation.  Amendments or supplements to the zoning code may be

      (1)   By motion of the Commission.
      (2)   By motion of a majority of the members of the full Council and

      (3)   By the filing of an application by one or more of the owners or

upon their own motion, the Commission shall have forty-five days to act on the
motion or application.  Such action shall be taken at a duly called public
meeting of the Commission that is open to the public.  At such meeting, a
majority of the full Commission shall determine what recommendation should be
made to the Council.  The Commission shall study the proposed change in the
terms of the public necessity, public convenience, general welfare, and good
zoning practice.  If no majority of the Commission can be obtained, then the
recommendation will be deemed as opposed to the application or motion.
      (2)   The Commission shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the

official action, all of which shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Clerk
and shall be a public record.
   (f)   Commission Recommendation to Council.  The Commission shall, within
ten days after determining its recommendation, recommend the approval or denial

thereof in writing to the Fiscal Officer.
   (g)   Public Hearing by Council.  Within seven days of the receipt of the
recommendation of the Commission, the Fiscal Officer shall set forth the
requested zoning amendment in ordinance form, and schedule a public hearing. 
At this public hearing, the ordinance representing the requested zoning
amendment shall be introduced and given its first formal reading.
   (h)   Notice.
      (1)   The Fiscal Officer shall give at least thirty days notice of the
time and place thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipal
corporation.  Posting as provided in Ohio R.C. 731.25 is allowed in lieu of a
published notice.
      (2)   If the ordinance intends to re-zone or re-district ten or fewer
parcels of land, as listed on the tax duplicate, the Fiscal Officer shall mail
notice of the hearing date, by first class mail at least twenty days before the
date of the public hearing, to the owners of property within and contiguous to,
and directly across the street from such parcel(s), to the address(es) of such
owner(s) appearing on the Ottawa County Auditor's current tax list or the
Ottawa County Treasurer's mailing list.  The applicant will be required to
submit the names and address(es) of the owner(s) and the failure of the
applicant to submit a complete and accurate list may invalidate any action
taken by the Council on the application.  Failure of delivery of such notice
shall not invalidate any such ordinance.
   (i)   Records.  During such thirty days, as set forth in subsection (h)
hereof, a copy of the text of such ordinance, together with the maps, plans,
and reports forming part of or referred to in such ordinance (including the
information contained in the recommendation of the Commission), shall be on
file, for public examination, in the office of the Fiscal Officer.
   (j)   Action by Council.  The Council shall either adopt or deny the
ordinance, or adopt some modification thereof within sixty-five days of the
first reading of the ordinance or any modification thereto.  In the event the
Council modifies the recommendation of the Commission, an affirmative vote of
at least three-fourths of the full Council shall be required to enact such
modification.  The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the full Council
shall be required to adopt any recommendation of the Commission.  Any
recommendation that does not receive at least an affirmative majority vote of
the full Council, or at least three-fourths affirmative vote of the full
Council in the case of a modification, shall be deemed denied and rendered
ineffective.  No such ordinance shall be passed unless it has been read on
three different days except that such ordinance may become emergency
legislation if the Council votes to dispense with this rule.
   (k)   Effective Date and Referendum.  Such amendment adopted by Council
shall become effective thirty days after the date of such adoption by passage
of the ordinance unless there is presented to the Fiscal Officer a petition,
signed by a number of qualified voters residing in the Village equal to not
less that ten percent of the total vote cast in the Village at the last
preceding general election at which a governor was elected, requesting the
Council to submit the zoning ordinance to the electors of the Village for
approval or rejection at the next general election.  No amendment for which
such referendum vote has been conducted shall be put into effect unless a
majority of the citizens voting cast their vote in favor of the amendment. 
Upon certification by the Board of Elections that the amendment has been
approved by the votes, it shall take immediate effect.
(Ord. 755-99, passed 11-13-99; Ord. 1010-11.  Passed 4-11-11.)

provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of
the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare. 
Where the zoning code imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings
or land, or upon the height of buildings, or requires longer open spaces than
are imposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations, or by
easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of the zoning code shall

paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence or provision immediately involved in
the controversy in which such judgment or decree shall be rendered.

   (k)   Complaints Regarding Violations.  Whenever a violation of the zoning
code occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written
complaint.  Such complaint, stating fully the causes and basis thereof, shall
be filed with the Zoning Inspector.  The Zoning Inspector shall record properly
such complaint, immediately investigate, and take action thereon as provided by
the zoning code.
   (l)   Revocation of Certificates.  Any zoning certificate that is based upon
a false statement shall be revoked. Whenever the fact of such false statement
shall be established to the satisfaction of the Commission, the zoning
certificate shall be revoked and a stop work order shall be delivered to the
holder of the revoked zoning certificate upon the premises concerned, or if
such holder is not found there, by posting the stop work order in some
conspicuous place upon the said premises.  Any person who shall proceed
thereafter with such work or use covered by the revoked zoning certificate
without having obtained a new zoning certificate shall be deemed guilty of a
violation of the zoning code.
   (m)   Stop Work Order.  The Zoning Inspector shall issue a stop work order
on any construction and use of land or building when a required zoning
certificate has not been issued for such work or use of land or building, when
a zoning certificate has been revoked for such work or use of land or building,
or when a violation of the zoning code occurs.  The stop work order shall be
sent in writing to the property owner or holder of the revoked certificate, or,
if such person cannot be found, by posting the stop work order in some
conspicuous place upon the said premises.  Any person who shall proceed
thereafter with such work or use shall be deemed guilty of a violation of the
zoning code.

1262.03  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals.  The Commission is granted the power and responsibility to
hear and decide appeals concerning the interpretation or administration of this
zoning code. Appeals to the Commission concerning interpretation or
administration of the zoning code may be made by any person aggrieved or by any
officer or bureau of the legislative authority of the Village affected by any
decision of the Zoning Inspector. Such appeal shall be made within twenty days
after the decision by filing with the Zoning Inspector and with the Commission,
a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is
being made. The Zoning Inspector shall transmit to the Commission all the
papers constituting the record, based upon which the action appealed was taken.
   (b)   Fees.  See Section
1262.02(i).
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings.  An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed, unless the Zoning Inspector, upon whose actions the
appeal is made, certifies to the Commission after the notice of appeal is filed
with him/her, that by reason of facts stated in the appeal, a stay would, in
his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Commission or by a court of record, with a notice to the Zoning
Inspector upon whose actions the appeal is made.
   (d)   Variances. 
      (1)   The Commission may authorize, as set forth below, and upon request
in specific cases, a variance from the terms of the zoning code.
      (2)   There are two types of variances which may be granted: an area
variance and a use variance.  The factors to be considered by the Commission
differ for the two types of variances as follows:
         A.   Area variance - "Practical Difficulties".
            1.   An area variance is a departure from the provisions of the
zoning code usually relating to setbacks, side yards, height, frontage/lot
width, and lot size. These variances relate to the physical characteristics of
the property. An area variance may be granted when the strict enforcement of
the zoning requirements for the specific lot would present "practical
difficulties", basically making the property unusable.
            2.   The factors or standards to be considered and weighed for an
area variance include, but are not limited to the following:
               a.   Whether the property in question can yield a reasonable
return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance.
               b.   Whether the variance is substantial.
               c.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would
be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance.
               d.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
               e.   Whether the property owner's predicament can be feasibly
prevented, reduced, or eliminated through some method other than a variance.
               f.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning
requirements would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the
variance.
         B.   Use variance - "Undue Hardship".
            1.   A use variance concerns the development or conversion of land
for a use not permitted in a specific zoning district as specified in the
zoning code.  The factors or standards applied to a use variance are those
related to the concept of "unnecessary hardship".
            2.   A use variance must not be contrary to the public interest and
the Commission must insure that the spirit and intent of the zoning code is
observed.  In other words, the use requested must be consistent and harmonious
with the existing uses in the specific zoning district. In addition, all of the
following conditions must be found to exist:
               a.   Special circumstances or conditions which apply to the
building or land in question, are peculiar to such lot or property and do not
apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity and were not created
by the applicant.
               b.   The granting of the variance is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights and would not merely
serve as a convenience to the applicant.
               c.   The variance will not reduce an adequate supply of light
and air to any adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in
public streets or increase the danger of fire or imperil the public safety or
unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
surrounding areas or in any way impair the health, safety, convenience, or
general welfare of the inhabitants of the Village.
   (e)   Procedures.  The procedures for applying for appeals and variances are
as follows:
      (1)   Application.  An appeal or variance shall not be granted unless and
until a written application for such is submitted.
         A.   An application for an appeal shall contain the following
information:
            1.   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s).
            2.   Legal description of the property to which the appeal
pertains.
            3.   Description of the appeal made.
         B.   An application for a variance shall contain the following
information:
            1.   Name, address, and phone number of the applicant(s).
            2.   Legal description of the property.
            3.   Description of the nature of the variance requested.
            4.   Statements addressing the factors or standards listed for an
area variance or a use variance.
            5.   Adequate drawings illustrating the size and location of the
lot, the size and location of buildings and structures proposed and existing on
the lot, dimensions of all yards and open spaces, and other information
necessary for the enforcement of the zoning code.
      (2)   Public hearing.  Upon receiving a completed application for an
appeal or a variance, the Commission shall comply with the notice requirements
of paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) hereof, and shall hold a public hearing within
forty days.
      (3)   Public hearing notice.  A notice of the time, date and place of the
public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within
the Village at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall set
forth the nature of the variance requested or appeal made. Posting as provided
for in Ohio R.C. 731.25 is allowed in lieu of a published notice.
      (4)   Adjoining property owners. The Commission shall notify owners of
property contiguous to and directly across the street from the parcel involved
in the appeal or variance, by a first class mailing at least seven days prior
to the hearing date. The applicant requesting the appeal or variance shall
provide the owners' names and addresses. Failure by the applicant to submit a
correct and complete list of such owners may invalidate the Commission's
actions.
      (5)   Action.
         A.   The Commission shall reach a decision on the variance or appeal
within thirty days after the public hearing is/are completed. The decision of
the Commission shall be by motion and the decision shall be set forth in a
written decision. A certified copy of the Commission's decision shall be
transmitted to the applicant and the Zoning Inspector within ten days of the
date of the decision. Where special conditions or requirements are imposed they
shall be incorporated on any permit issues.
         B.   Decisions of the Commission are considered an administrative
action and may be appealed within thirty days of receipt of the written
decision of the Commission, to the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas pursuant
to Ohio law. The Council, or any other officer, board, or department of the
Village may appeal any decision of the Commission if the Village deems it may
be adversely affected by the decision of the Commission. An appeal to the Court
of Common Pleas shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed, unless the Zoning Inspector whose decision is appealed from shall
certify to the Court of Common Pleas after the notice of appeal is filed, that
by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order granted by the Court.
         C.   The variance or appeal and any conditions thereto shall be made a
part of the record.
      (6)   Additional conditions. The Commission shall have the power to
impose additional conditions and safeguards other than those stated in the
zoning code when granting variances. Such additional conditions shall be
reasonable and necessary to promote and preserve the public safety, general
welfare and economic viability of the neighborhood and community and shall be
imposed solely for the purpose of minimizing the effect of the variance on
surrounding property and the community as a whole. Violations of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the zoning code and
punishable under Section
1262.99.
      (7)   Lapses of variances.  A variance, once granted, shall not be
withdrawn or changed unless, after the expiration of eighteen months, no
construction has taken place in accordance with the terms and conditions under
which said variance was granted. In such circumstances, the variance shall be
deemed null and void and all regulations governing said premises in question
shall revert to those in effect before the variance was granted.
(Ord. 1133-16.  Passed 9-12-16.)
1262.04  ENFORCEMENT; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   This zoning code shall be enforced by the Zoning Inspector. In no case
shall a site plan approval be issued if the building or use would be in
violation of any of the provisions of the zoning code or of any of the
ordinances of the Village.
   (b)   Violations.  Pursuant to this zoning code it shall be unlawful to:
      (1)   Use or occupy any land or place; build, erect, alter, remodel,
restore, or rebuild thereon any building or structure; permit any building or
structure to remain on such land; or use, occupy, or operate such building or
structure, in any way or for any use or purpose which is not permitted by the
provisions of this zoning code;
      (2)   Use or occupy any parcel of land; use or occupy a new building or
structure; or enlarge, substitute, or otherwise change the use, occupancy, or
configuration of any land, building, or structure, without having received a
zoning permit, conditional use permit, or certificate of zoning completion, as
applicable, indicating compliance with the provisions of this zoning code from
the Zoning Inspector;
      (3)   Violate or fail to perform any condition, stipulation, or safeguard
set forth in any certificate, permit, or approval issued pursuant to this
zoning code, or continue to use or occupy the premises, building, or structure
as previously authorized by such certificate, permit, or approval beyond the
duration limit therein stated;
      (4)   Continue construction, renovation, or improvements contrary to a
stop work order or notice of violation;
      (5)   Refuse to permit the Zoning Inspector to enter any premises in the
Village to investigate a reported violation of the provisions of this zoning
code; or
      (6)   Knowingly, make any materially false statement of fact in an
application to the Zoning Inspector for development plan approval, a zoning
permit, conditional use permit, certificate of non-conforming use, or
certificate of zoning compliance, or in the plans or specifications submitted
to the Zoning Inspector in relation to such application.
   (c)   Any site plan approval that is issued based upon a false statement by
the applicant shall be revoked. Whenever the fact of such false statement shall
be established to the satisfaction of the Commission, the site plan approval
shall be revoked by delivering a notice in writing to the holder of the revoked
site plan approval upon the premises concerned or if such holder is not found
there, by posting said notice of revocation in some conspicuous place upon the
said premises. Any person who shall proceed thereafter with work or use covered
by the revoked site plan without having obtained a new site plan approval,
shall be deemed guilty of a violation of the zoning code.
   (d)   Violation Considered a Nuisance. Any building or structure erected,
altered, moved, razed, or converted, or any use of land or premises carried on
in violation of any provision of this zoning code may be declared to be a
nuisance. Any building or land use activity considered to be a possible
violation of any provision of this zoning code that is observed by any Village
official shall be reported to the Zoning Inspector.
   (e)   Inspection of Property. The Zoning Inspector may inspect any building
or structure erected, altered, moved, razed, or converted, or any use of land
or premises carried on in alleged violation of any of the provisions of this
zoning code including any alleged failure to comply with any conditions placed
upon an application at the time of approval.
   (f)   Notice of Violation.
      (1)   Upon finding a violation, the Zoning Inspector shall order, in
writing, the owner, agent occupant or operator of such building, structure, or
premises to correct, within a stated reasonable time, all conditions that are
found to be in violation of this zoning code.  After such a notice is served,
no work, except to correct the violation or comply with the notice, shall
proceed on any building, structure, or premises included in the violation.
      (2)   Such notice of violation shall be by either personal delivery to
the person or persons responsible, or by certified mail, addressed to the
person or persons responsible at the last known address.
   (g)   Issuance of a Citation. Prior to the issuance of any citation the
Zoning Inspector shall consult with the Village Solicitor to insure that the
zoning code is being properly administered.
(Ord. 1133-16. Passed 9-12-16.)
1262.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Every person, corporation, or firm who violates, disobeys, neglects,
or refuses to comply with any provisions of the zoning code or any permit,
license, or exception granted hereunder, or any lawful order of the Zoning
Inspector, Board of Zoning Appeals, Planning Commission, or Village Council
issued in pursuance of this zoning code shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree. A subsequent violation of this zoning code involving the same
property, the same violator, and occurring within two years of the last prior
conviction for the same violation, shall constitute a misdemeanor of the third
degree. Each and every day that a violation remains uncorrected after receiving
a notice of violation from the Village constitutes a separate violation.
   (b)   The owner, tenant or occupant of any land or structure, or part
thereof, or any design professional, builder, contractor, vendor, authorized
agent or other person who knowingly participates in, assists, directs, creates
or maintains any situation that is contrary to the requirements of the zoning
code may be held jointly and severally responsible for the violation and be
subject to penalties and remedies.

other equitable relief in court to stop any violation of this zoning code.
   (d)   The Village may seek a court order in the nature of mandamus,
abatement, nuisance or other action or proceeding to abate or remove a
violation or to otherwise restore premises in questions to the condition in
which they existed prior to the violation.
   (e)   The Zoning Inspector shall enforce the zoning code by inspecting the
properties within the Village pursuant to the zoning code for violations. Upon
discovering an apparent violation, the Zoning Inspector shall prepare and issue
a citation according to law. Hearing on any such citation issued by the Zoning
Inspector shall be heard in the Ottawa County Municipal Court and shall be
prosecuted by the Village Legal Counsel.
