EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

items removed at the applicant's expense due to failure to clear the area.
The contact person for administration of park rules and regulations as well as
inspections following use shall be the Village Administrator or his duly
authorized representative. Unless an emergency situation occurs, contact should
occur during regular business hours.
Liability responsibilities: 
Certificates of insurance (minimum of $1,000,000 liability) may be required for
facility reservations, depending on the scope of the event. The certificates
can be obtained through the event holder's insurance carrier. The Village must
have a signed original copy of the insurance certificate before the event can
be scheduled on the calendar. Your insurance carrier may charge an additional
fee for the "additional insured endorsement".
Each general liability policy shall be endorsed with the following specific
language:
"The Village of Bradford, its officers, agents, and employees, is named as
additional insured for all liability arising out of the operations by or on
behalf of the named insured in the performance of this agreement."
"The insurance provided is primary coverage of Village of Bradford with respect
to any insurance or self insurance programs maintained by the Village, and no
insurance held or owned by the Village shall be called upon to contribute to a
loss."
The location and date of event must be included on certificate.
Additional cleanup responsibilities:
When using the park, the Village asks that all excess trash is picked up and
placed in dumpsters behind the City Building.
Dumpsters may be required for refuse generated from a large event. The
applicant is responsible for making these arrangements by contacting a local
disposal service.
Portable restroom facilities may be required for groups in excess of 100 at a
rate of 1 per 100 people. The applicant is responsible for arranging services
and the Village Administrator shall designate the location of the facilities.
Miscellaneous considerations:
For large events with an expected attendance of over 100 people and/or lasting
more than 1 day, a detailed event plan explaining the provisions planned for
use of facilities must be submitted to the Village Administrator at least 60
days prior to the event. Upon approval of the event plan, receipt of required
payment, filing of certificate of insurance and copies of any necessary
permits, the Village Administrator will enter into a facilities agreement with
the event representative.
In extenuating circumstances, the Administrator may ask that a representative
of the organization approach the Village Council for approval of a planned
event before entering into a facilities agreement with the organization.
Services required may include water, sewer, and electric. These services can be
obtained from the Village at a reasonable cost. The Administrator will advise
the representative of the current rate schedule for such services in accordance
with the Water and Sewer Use Ordinance.
Before any sale of any food can occur on Village properties, a county food
permit must be obtained in advance of the event.
Parking must be planned for large events. The Village is aware that casual use
will take up some available parking sites; however, if the event is expected to
approach levels that will exceed parking capability, arrangements should be
made with the Village Administrator or other duly authorized representative of
the Village of Bradford.
Although camping within the park is not encouraged, special consideration may
be entertained for large and/or special events. In such cases, the organization
will be assigned a limited number of camping spaces in designated areas at a
cost of $10.00 per unit per day. Each unit must display a permit issued by the
Village.
Large events may require the organization to obtain additional security
services. This may be coordinated with the Miami County Sheriff's office, the
Village Administrator, and the organization's agent.
The Village Administrator shall keep a calendar of all park reservations and
announce them prior to the event at a regularly scheduled Village Council
meeting during the Administrator’s scheduled report to Council. He will also
provide a list to the Miami County Sheriff's office to advise deputies of
reservations.

      (3)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which this
municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such

181.15 RELIEF AND RECIPROCITY PROVISIONS.
   It is the intent of this section that a taxpayer, subject to tax in more
than one municipality on the same income, who has complied with the provisions
hereof shall not be required by this chapter to pay a total municipal income
tax on such income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.
   (a)   Residents of Bradford.
      (1)   When a resident of Bradford is subject to and has paid, or has
acknowledged liability for, a municipal income tax in another municipality on
the same income taxable under this chapter and such other municipality does not
allow a credit to its non-residents, such Bradford residents may claim a credit
of the amount of such tax paid to such other municipality, but not in excess of
the tax assessed by this chapter.
      (2)   A.   When a resident of Bradford is subject to and has paid, or has
acknowledged liability for, a municipal income tax in another municipality on
the same income taxable under this chapter, and such other municipality allows
a credit to its non-residents on the same basis as provided in subsection (b)
(1) hereof, a credit shall be allowed against Bradford income tax of fifty
percent (50%) of the tax due hereunder or fifty percent (50%) of the tax due
under this chapter of such other municipality, whichever is the lesser.
         B.   If the tax due such other municipality has been paid to or
withheld in such other municipality, a resident of Bradford may claim credit
for and assign to the Village of Bradford any claim for refund to which he may
be entitled from such other municipality. In the event an amount is not
received by the Village, equal to such credit claimed by reason of tax payment
made to, or withheld in, such other municipality, then the taxpayer shall be
liable to the Village for an amount by which the claimed credit exceeds the
amount recovered on such assignment by the Village, together with penalty and
interest. If satisfactory evidence is offered, however that the taxpayer is
entitled to the claim covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be
deprived of credit therefor because of fault or neglect on the part of either
municipality.
         C.   Assignment of any claim for refund to which a Bradford resident
may be entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as
payment of that portion of Bradford income tax represented by such assignment;
provided, however, should an overpayment result from the credit allowed by
reason of such assignment, no refund thereof shall be made until such
assignment has been accepted for payment by such other municipality.
   (b)   Non-Residents of Bradford. 
      (1)   When a non-resident of Bradford is subject to the tax imposed by
this ordinance and is also subject to tax on the same income in the
municipality of his residence, a credit of fifty percent (50%) of the tax due
under this ordinance or fifty percent (50%) of the tax due under this chapter
of such other municipality, whichever is the lesser, shall be allowed against
the tax due under this chapter, provided:
         A.   Such other municipality imposes on its residents a tax on the
same income and reciprocal provision is made in this chapter of such other
municipality granting to non-residents thereof a credit on the same basis as
provided in subsection (b)(1) hereof against the tax levied thereby;
         B.   Such non-resident is subject to and has paid, or has acknowledged
liability in the municipality of his residence for any tax due after such
reciprocal credit is allowed; and
         C.   The municipality of his residence furnished evidence of payment
of tax therein or evidence of assignment by the taxpayer of his claim for
reciprocal credit to such other municipality.
      (2)   Any amount due a non-resident as a result of having overpaid the
tax due to the Village, or arising from allowance of the credit provided for
herein may, under regulations adopted by the Administrator, be assigned to and
paid to such other municipality.
   (c)   The credits provided for in subsections (a) and (b) hereof will not be
allowed unless the same are claimed in a timely return or form acceptable to,
and filed with the Administrator, in the event the taxpayer fails, neglects or
refuses to file such timely return or form he shall not be entitled to such
credit and shall be liable for the full amount of tax assessed by this
ordinance, together with such interest and penalties, both civil and criminal,
as are prescribed to this chapter.
   (d)   Any claim for credit for income taxes paid another municipality on the
same income taxable hereunder, or claim for or assignment of any refund due to
the credit provided for herein, must be filed with the Administrator on or
before December 31st of the year following that for which such credit is
claimed. Provided, however, in the event such claim for reciprocity refund
shall have been assigned to the municipality of residence, such municipality of
residence must file a claim for refund with the Administrator on or before
January 31st next following such December 31st. Failure to file such claim for
reciprocity credit or refund, or assignment thereof, within the times
prescribed herein shall render such credit, claim for refund, or assignment
null and void.
      (Ord. 74-11. Passed 1-30-75.)
181.16 SAVING CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax against
any individual or any of the several groups specified herein, is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
ordinance and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this ordinance. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of the Council of this municipality that this
ordinance would have been adopted as such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid
sentence, clause, section or part thereof not been included herein.
(Ord. 74-11. Passed 1-30-75.)
181.17 COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   This chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is
concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of taxes levied
hereunder and actions or proceedings for collecting any tax so levied or
enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall continue
effective until all of said taxes levied hereunder are fully paid and any and
all suits and prosecutions for the collection of said taxes or for the
punishment of violations of this chapter shall have been fully terminated,
subject to the limitations contained in Sections
181.11  and
181.12  hereof.

      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other

monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two

under division (B) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall file with the Tax Administrator a return showing the amount of tax
withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer from the qualifying wages of
each employee and remitted to the Tax Administrator. A return filed by an
employer, agent, or other payer under this division shall be accepted by the

respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Ordinance to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for

         (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the Municipality
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in the Municipality than in any other municipal corporation on
that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent
in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with ORC Chapter
718, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)(1)
of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying
wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such
qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Municipality exceeds the twenty-day (20) threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to the Municipality for any subsequent days in that calendar year on
which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in the Municipality.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Municipality
under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Municipality for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
Municipality.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those

for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in section 3(43) of this Ordinance. To determine
whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable year, a Tax
Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax Administrator with
the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
182.051.

the Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   “Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
section
182.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in section

182.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under ORC
Chapter 5745.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
outside the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight
(8);
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
182.19.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by section
182.19(A) of this Ordinance.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in divisions (B)(1) and (I) of this section, receipts from sales and
rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation
as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,
the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under section 182.081.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of section
182.03, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a
portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt
from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its
net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other
than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the
amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
182.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (1)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
 182.05 of this Code.

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in ORC
4927.01.

5727.01.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
182.30 of this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(b)(1) or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
182.30 of this Chapter is terminated, a valid election made under Section
182.36 of this Chapter is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder
of the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
182.03(1) of this Ordinance, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under section
182.03(1) of this Ordinance to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
182.062 exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
182.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in section
182.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under section
182.062 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
Ordinance on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under ORC 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under ORC 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to section 182.081.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in section
182.096.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in section
182.096.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires the Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
Ordinance, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom section
182.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts

circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.

payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.

generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Ordinance, provided that the generic form,

Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Ordinance governing
the filing of returns, reports, or documents.

The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this Ordinance.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's

      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this Ordinance. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)
(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

appeal of a municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically
provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The taxpayer may submit to the Tax Administrator a copy of
the federal extension request, and documentation that such request was granted,
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the last day of the
table year to which the return relates. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax
return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this Ordinance is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of ORC 5747.08, a taxpayer
shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (F)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under this section, the tax administrator shall not make any
inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or
before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due
date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under

the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.

   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Ordinance must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, the
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10).
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
182.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

filed under this division within the period prescribed by (A)(2) of this
section
182.095 for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
182.096. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10).
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three (3) years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under section
182.18.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section 182.096 shall be considered to have

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within (90) ninety days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in section
182.10(A)(4) of this Ordinance.

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Ordinance for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Ordinance. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Ordinance shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this Ordinance
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
182.10 of this Ordinance, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
182.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
182.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
182.99 for a violation of section
182.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
         (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC Chapter 718 or by the
Ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC Chapter 718 or this
Ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Ordinance and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Ordinance.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
182.15.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
ORC 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in ORC 718.18 is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days (60) after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in ORC Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members shall be domiciled in the Municipality. Two members shall be
appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. Each regular
member shall have a different expiration date for their term. There is no limit
on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed
by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in ORC 718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was
created. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall
hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall
impair the power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the
powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty (60) days after
the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty (60) days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under
division (C) of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to
prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the
taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney
at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may
allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a
case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the board's final
hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary
mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing
the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the
board's final determination as provided in ORC 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under ORC 149.43. For this reason, any documentation,
copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working papers for each
case must be maintained in a secure location under the control of the Tax
Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove such
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board
of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public
body subject to ORC 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to
the public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the
hearing.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One (1) year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in section
182.18 . That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax
Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixty (60) days after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixty (60) days after the date on which the final determination of the Local
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole
or in part, or that reversal is available or taken.
   
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three (3) years
after the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud,
failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent (25%) or more
of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in section
182.096.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under section
182.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by section
182.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (D) of this
section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

      (2)    (A)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and each municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducted business during the previous taxable year of
its termination of the election.
         (B)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form

not less than sixty days before the effective date of the increase, after which
effective date the commissioner shall apply the increased rate.
      (2)    A municipal corporation, within ninety days of receiving a

forward, the duration of any such carryforward;
         (D)    Any overpayments of tax that the taxpayer has elected to carry

         (E)    Any other information the municipal corporation deems relevant
in order to effectuate the tax commissioner's efficient administration of the
tax on the municipal corporation's behalf.
      (3)    If any municipal corporation fails to timely comply with divisions
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, the tax commissioner shall notify the director
of budget and management, who, upon receiving such notification, shall withhold
from each payment made to the municipal corporation under Section
182.33 of this Chapter fifty per cent of the amount of the payment otherwise

182.31 DEFINITIONS (ADDITIONAL).
   If a term used in Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the
Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code,
in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in
this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
182.03 of this Chapter, the definition in this section shall control for all
uses of that term in Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter.
   As used in Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter only:
   (a)   “Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
182.32 of this Chapter, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating
loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (c)(23)(E)(ii) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)    (A)    Except as provided in division (b)(4)(B) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (B)    Division (b)(4)(A) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         (C)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of
Section
182.36 of this Chapter.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(b) of Section
182.36 of this Chapter.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (c)(47)(B) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made
the election described in division (c)(23)(E)(ii) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable
income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
182.03, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer"
may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and
includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation
of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The tax
commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (f)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
182.40.
      (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.32 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
Section
182.30.
   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)    (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (A)    Separate accounting;
         (B)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (D)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section
182.40.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of Section
182.40.
   (c)    As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)    The employer;
         (B)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)(B) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)    For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (A)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (B)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (c)(11)(L) of Section
182.03 and division (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code by a
municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its
net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation.
In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon
which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the
stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (g)    When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.33 CERTIFICATION OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.
   (a)    On or before the last day of each month, the tax commissioner shall
certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to each
municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and
declarations of estimated tax under Sections
182.35 and
182.38 of this Chapter, less any amounts previously distributed and net of any
audit adjustments made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for the calendar
month preceding the month in which the certification is made. Not later than
the fifth day of each month, the director shall provide for payment of the
amount certified to each municipal corporation from the municipal income tax
fund, plus a pro rata share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund
since the previous payment under this section. Each municipal corporation's
share of such earnings shall equal the proportion that the municipal
corporation's certified tax payment is of the total taxes certified to all
municipal corporations in that quarter. All investment earnings on money in the
municipal income tax fund shall be credited to that fund.
   (b)    If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a
taxable year exceeds the amount payable to that municipal corporation under
Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter after accounting for amounts remitted with the annual
return and as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall proceed according to
divisions (A) and (B) of section 5703.77 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.34 INFORMATION PROVIDED TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS; CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Sections
182.30 to

information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper judicial
order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code. The
tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service with copies of
returns filed. This section does not prohibit the publication of statistics in
a form which does not disclose information with respect to particular
taxpayers.
   (b)    In May and November of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide
each tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer that
filed tax returns with the commissioner under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter and that had municipal taxable income apportionable to
the municipal corporation under this chapter for any prior year:
      (1)    The taxpayer's name, address, and federal employer identification

utilized by the taxpayer;

corporations under Section
182.33, the tax commissioner shall provide to each municipal corporation a
report stating the name and federal identification number of every taxpayer
that made estimated payments that are attributable to the municipal corporation
and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.
   (d)    Not later than the thirty-first day of January of each year, every
municipal corporation having taxpayers that have made the election allowed
under Section
182.30 shall provide to the tax commissioner, in a format prescribed by the
commissioner, the name and mailing address of up to two persons to whom the
municipal corporation requests that the commissioner send the information
described in divisions (b) and (c) of this section. The commissioner shall not
provide such information to any person other than a person who is designated to
receive the information under this section and who is employed by the municipal
corporation or by a tax administrator, as defined in Section
182.03, that administers the municipal corporation's income tax, except as may
otherwise be provided by law.
   (e)   (1)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules that further govern the
terms and conditions under which tax returns filed with the commissioner under
this chapter, and any other information gained in the performance of the
commissioner's duties prescribed by this chapter, shall be available for
inspection by properly authorized officers, employees, or agents of the
municipal corporations to which the taxpayer's net profit is apportioned under
Section
182.32.
      (2)    As used in this division, "properly authorized officer, employee,
or agent" means an officer, employee, or agent of a municipal corporation who
is authorized by charter or ordinance of the municipal corporation to view or

   (f)   (1)    If, upon receiving the information described in division (b) of
Section
182.41 or division (b) or (c) of this section, a municipal corporation
discovers that it has additional information in its possession that could
result in a change to a taxpayer's tax liability, the municipal corporation may
refer the taxpayer to the tax commissioner for an audit. Such referral shall be
made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information
that forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)    Upon receipt of a referral under division (f)(1) of this section,
the commissioner shall review the referral and may conduct an audit of the
taxpayer that is the subject of the referral based on the information in the
referral and any other relevant information available to the commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in division (f) of this section shall be construed as
forming the sole basis upon which the commissioner may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer.
      (4)    Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a municipal corporation
from filing a writ of mandamus if the municipal corporation believes that the
commissioner has violated the commissioner's fiduciary duty as the
administrator of the tax levied by the municipal corporation.
         (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.35 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (a)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section
182.07 of this Chapter, shall be submitted to the tax commissioner, on a form
and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth
day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
182.31,
182.32, and, if applicable,
182.36 of this Chapter onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
   (b)    The tax commissioner shall immediately forward to the treasurer of
state all amounts the commissioner receives pursuant to Sections
182.30 to
182.45. The treasurer shall credit ninety-nine and one-half per cent of such
amounts to the municipal income tax fund and the remainder to the municipal
income tax administrative fund established under section 5745.03 of the Revised
Code.
   (c)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.

         (B)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (B)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (C)   An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code,
the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
   (e)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (f)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or

either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
   (b)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by non-electronic means.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;

defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding
for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial
election unless a change in the reporting method is required under federal law.
The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period
unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
division (b)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
182.30, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) or (2) of
Section
182.063 is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
182.30 is terminated, a valid election made under this section is binding upon
the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (c)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.31, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (b) of Section
182.31 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (A)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.32, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.32 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (A)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
182.32, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (B)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      
   (f)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
182.32 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the corporation,
an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group. (Ord. 0-
18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.37 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
182.30 fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
Section
182.40, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.38 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (A)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (A)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (B)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(b) of Section
182.35.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (A)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (C)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with Section
182.33.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.39 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (A)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (B)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
182.30 fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per cent of the
amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on
the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
182.41, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of one thousand
dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this
division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the
date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
182.40 without regard to any time limitation for the assessment imposed by
division (a) of that section.
   (b)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under Section
182.33. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.40 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
182.41 for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit to an
assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to assessment
as required by Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (b)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (d)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
182.41 with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.41 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (a) of Section
182.40. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
   (b)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under Section
182.33.
   (c)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed
8-23-18.)
182.42 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
182.30 and used to determine the tax due under Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
182.40 for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under this section,
together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
182.41, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements of that
section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
Section
182.41. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed
8-23-18.)
182.43 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (b)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
182.30 to
182.45 of this Chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a
municipal corporation.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 1-23-18.)
182.44 CREDITS.
   (a)    A credit, granted by resolution or ordinance of a municipal
corporation pursuant to section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised Code, shall be
available to a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
182.30, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A municipal
corporation shall submit the following information to the tax commissioner on
or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-first day of January of
the first year in which the taxpayer is eligible to receive the credit:
      (1)    A copy of the agreement entered into by the municipal corporation
and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of the Revised Code;
      (2)    A copy of the municipal ordinance or resolution authorizing the
agreement entered into between the municipal corporation and the taxpayer.
   (b)   (1)    Each taxpayer that claims a credit shall submit, with the
taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the municipal corporation
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of
the Revised Code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement. (Ord. 0-18-04. Passed 8-23-18.)
182.45 RECKLESS VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES.
   (a)    Except as provided in division (b) of this section, whoever
recklessly violates division (a) of Section
182.34 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be
subject to a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for a
term of up to six months, or both.
   (b)    Any person who recklessly discloses information received from the
internal revenue service in violation of division (a) of Section
182.34 shall be guilty of a felony of the fifth degree and shall be subject to
a fine of not more than five thousand dollars plus the costs of prosecution, or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.
   (c)    Each instance of access or disclosure in violation of division (a) of

corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any

designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and impoundment of the license plates of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)

offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a
category described in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this section

license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.

that involves the offender or delinquent child who is the subject of the
conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from the wrongful entrustment
of a motor vehicle.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community residential sanction

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
 
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same

(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally retarded,
developmentally disabled, or physically impaired child under twenty-one years
of age shall not begin to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
 
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
 
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF INCARCERATION.
   (a)   Any person who is convicted of an offense other than a minor
misdemeanor and is sentenced to confinement in one of the county jails, or
other secured facility, shall reimburse the Village of Bradford for its
expenses incurred by reason of the offender’s confinement, including, but not
limited to, the expenses relating to the provisions of food, clothing, shelter,
medical, hospital, dental, orthodontia, optometry and/or other related
expenses. Such reimbursement shall include expenses for pre-conviction
confinement when credit for such confinement is credited against the term of
imprisonment.
   (b)   The amount of the reimbursement required by this section shall be
determined by the Mayor’s Court after a hearing held pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.223, or any subsequent amendment thereto. The amount of the reimbursement
ordered by the Court shall not exceed the actual cost of the confinement. The
court shall consider all factors that affect the offender’s financial ability
to make reimbursement to the Village. When the Mayor’s Court makes a
reimbursement determination pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.223, a judgment entry
ordering reimbursement shall be filed and entered that sets forth the total
amount of reimbursement due to the Village, and the reimbursement schedules and
methods.
   (c)   This section shall not apply to offenders that the court finds to be
indigent.
   (d)   Funds that are reimbursed to the Village pursuant to this section
shall be paid into the general fund of the Village treasury.
   (e)   If an offender does not pay to the Village the reimbursement ordered
by the court pursuant to this section, the Village Solicitor may collect that
claim or institute an appropriate civil action in the name of the Village in
the appropriate court of Common Pleas to recover from the offender such amount.
If an action is filed, it shall be brought not later than one year after the
person is released from incarceration. If it is deemed in the best interests of
the Village, the Village Solicitor is authorized to compromise and settle such
claim in an amount less that the total reimbursement due to the Village. If an
offender does not comply with the reimbursement determination for expenses of
confinement made by the court, then the offender is deemed to be acting in bad
faith and, in any civil action on behalf of the Village to recover from the
convict the reimbursement for the expenses of his confinement, the Village
Solicitor or his representative shall request an award of attorney fees as part
at the costs of the proceeding. The award of such attorney fees shall be paid
into the general fund of the Village treasury.
(Ord. 01-10. Passed 8-9-01.)
501.14  CONSPIRACY.

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.

trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:

processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section. If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic
violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
         B.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the
amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine
the extent of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount of
the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing provided that the amount of
restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or services
stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the court decides to impose
restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the
offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court
holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution
sought from the offender.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender
pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of                      Maximum
Misdemeanor                  Fine
First degree                 $ 5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically 2000.00
classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

505.01 DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS RUNNING AT LARGE; CONFINEMENT; PRESUMPTION
OF ANIMAL OWNER, KEEPER, OR HARBORER; MAINTENANCE OF ANIMAL WASTE.
   (a)   Animals Running at Large.
      (1)   No person, being the owner, keeper or harborer of any dog, cat or
other animal, shall permit such animal to run at large within the limits of the
municipality, except as may be provided hereafter. Unauthorized entry by such
animal upon any private premises or upon any public street or land shall
constitute running at large within the meaning of this section.
      (2)   An animal is presumed to be running at large if such animal is not
within an enclosed area or securely attached to a physical restraint or leash,
not more than 6' in length, and of a size and type necessary to control the
behavior of such animal.
      (3)   While upon any public way or property of another, such animal must
be under the reasonable restraint and control of a responsible person.
“Reasonable restraint and control” means restraint which conforms to the
animal’s weight, size and strength and to a person who is of suitable age, size
and strength to control such animal.
      (4)   No owner, keeper or harborer of any female dog shall permit it to
go beyond the premises of the owner, keeper or harborer at any time the dog is
in heat, unless the dog is under a proper restraint.
   (b)   Confinement of Animal.
      (1)   The owner, keeper or harborer of any dog, cat or other animal shall
at all times keep the animal either physically confined or restrained upon the
premises of such owner, keeper or harborer by a leash, chain, adequate fence or
secure enclosure necessary to prevent the animal from leaving the premises of
the owner, keeper or harborer. Any method of containment is not considered
sufficient during any period of time that the method of containment fails to
properly secure such animal.
      (2)   Any owner, keeper or harborer of an animal relying upon an
electronic fence, “Invisible Fence” or similar containment system must post
visible signage evidencing that such containment system is in place. It shall
not be a defense to a charge under this section that the electronic fence or
containment system was not working or that it failed to keep an animal from
leaving the owner’s premises.
   (c)   Presumption of Animal Owner, Keeper or Harborer. A person shall be
presumed to be the owner, keeper or harborer of an animal if such person does
or permits any of the following:
      (1)   Knowingly allows any animal to remain upon his or her property more
than 24 hours;
      (2)   Knowingly or recklessly feeds such animal food or water on a
regular basis for more than 24 hours;
      (3)   Knowingly restrains such animal from leaving his or her property
for more than 24 hours; or
      (4)   Knowingly accepts responsibility for the care of another person’s
animal.
   (d)   Limitation on Number of Dogs and Cats.
      (1)   No more than two (2) dogs or two (2) cats or (2) other similarly-
sized animals (except for puppies or kittens not over three months old) may be
kept in a single family dwelling or in any separate unit of a multiple family
dwelling or apartment within the Village.
   (e)   Maintenance of Animal Waste.
      (1)   Any animal waste (feces) caused by a dog, cat or other animal upon
any public land or right of way or upon private property, other than that of
the owner or person in charge of such animal, creates an unsanitary and
unhealthy condition and constitutes a nuisance.
      (2)   Any person, having control or charge of a dog, cat or other animal,
while away from such person’s premises, shall have on their person an
appropriate container for removing such animal waste. Further, any person
having control or charge of such animal shall be responsible for the immediate
removal of any animal waste caused by such animal.
      (3)   No person shall leave or dispose of any animal waste on any
property, public or private, other than in an appropriate receptacle or upon
the property of the owner or person in charge of such animal.
      (4)   A blind person who relies upon a guide dog may be exempt from the
provisions of this section upon application to the Village Administrator.
   (f)   Exceptions. It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of this
section that the animal was:
      (1)   Owned by a public law enforcement agency or licensed private law
enforcement agency, or authorized member thereof, and the animal was being
utilized for law enforcement purposes.
      (2)   Owned or kept by a person who is legally blind or has some other
disability which requires the use of a dog or other animal for the express
purpose of aiding such person.
   (g)   Penalties. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a
minor misdemeanor for a first offense.
      (2)   Whoever violates any provision of this section for a second or
third offense shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (3)   Whoever violates any provision of this section for more than a
third offense shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

animal found in violation of Section
505.01. If the impounded dog is not wearing a valid registration tag, or if the
impounded cat or other animal is not wearing an identification tag, the animal
shall forthwith be turned over to an officer charged by law with the custody
and disposal of such animals. If the animal is wearing a valid registration tag
or the identity of the owner, keeper or harborer is otherwise established,
notice shall immediately be given to such owner, keeper or harborer that the
animal has been impounded. Notice may be by telephone or by ordinary mail to
the last known address of such owner or harborer. The animal shall not be
released except upon the payment of reasonable expenses for its taking and
keeping. Any animal not redeemed within three days from the time it is seized

following redemption of the animal shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

R.C. 955.16, no person shall own, keep or harbor a dog more than three months
of age without annually registering such dog with the County Auditor. Failure

evidence of lack of registration and subject such dog to impounding and
disposition as provided by Ohio R.C. 955.16.

apart from any printed bill of lading or other railroad form, the length of
time in which such livestock may be detained in any cars or compartments

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute an
admission by any parties that the law has been violated. Consent agreement
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matters before the Board.
   (e)    If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this article, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determine that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be
open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen calendar
days nor more than thirty (30) calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the
Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named
persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure to
comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Village
legal counsel, in executive session, state its finding to and call the legal
counsel to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter,
with notice that if the Board upon investigation by the Secretary determines
that the person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days
following service of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will
recertify the matter to the Village legal counsel for enforcement. The Village
legal counsel shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the
name of the Human Rights Board of the Village of Bradford before a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (h)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

CHAPTER 559
Snow and Ice Removal
559.01    Duties defined.
559.02    Regulations relating to snow removal.
559.03    Parking regulations during snow emergency.
559.01  DUTIES DEFINED.
   (a)   It shall be the duty of the owner of each and every parcel of real
estate in the Village abutting upon a sidewalk to keep such sidewalk free of
snow and ice and to remove therefrom all snow and ice within twenty-four hours
after the abatement of the precipitation or storm during which such snow and
ice have accumulated.
   (b)   The responsibility for snow and ice removal shall be that of the owner
of the real estate abutting the sidewalk. If the real estate is being purchased
on land contract, the term “owner” shall include both the seller and the land
contract purchaser and the responsibility for the removal shall be determined
by such owner and purchaser. If the real estate is leased, the owner may
require that the tenant be responsible for sidewalk snow and ice removal,
however, such agreement shall be between the owner and the tenant and will not
alter the responsibility of the owner to comply with this chapter.
   (c)   If the snow and ice have not been completely removed within twenty-
four (24) hours from the sidewalks abutting the owner’s property, such failure
to remove shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Each twenty-four (24) hour
period the violation continues after the time for completion of the removal has
expired shall constitute a separate offense.
   (d)   If the snow and ice have not been removed within the time set forth
herein, the Village may itself remove the snow and ice therefrom or may
contract to have such snow and ice removed. The Village Administrator shall
establish a schedule of costs involved, including overhead and collection
costs. The Village Administrator shall invoice the appropriate abutting
property owner, which invoice shall be paid within thirty days. In the event
such invoice is not paid within thirty days, the matter may be referred to the
Village Solicitor for collection, or may be certified to the County Auditor for
collection with the real estate taxes.
(Ord. 07-17. Passed 1-24-08.)
559.02 REGULATIONS RELATING TO SNOW REMOVAL.
   The regulations regarding the removal of snow from private property and
dedicated rights of way shall be as follows:
   (a)   No contractor, private snow removal firm or other person, shall push,
shovel, or blow snow from private property onto or across any dedicated right
of way in the Village.
   (b)   No snow, removed from sidewalks or drive approaches on the dedicated
right of way, shall be deposited so as to obstruct the view from the street
within twelve feet of a street intersection or any drive approach, nor be
pushed, shoveled or blown onto or across the dedicated street.
   (c)   Snow removed from private property shall be deposited on private
property.
   (d)   No fire hydrant shall be covered or obstructed with snow.
   (e)   Snow removed from private property shall not be deposited in such a
way as to obstruct Village sidewalks.
   (f)   Whoever violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a
minor misdemeanor for the first offense and upon a second or subsequent offense
within one year of the first, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (Ord. 07-17. Passed 1-24-08.)
559.03  PARKING REGULATIONS DURING SNOW EMERGENCY.
   (a)   Definition of Snow Emergency. During any period of time prior to,
during and after snow falls in the Village of Bradford to a depth of three
inches or more, a snow emergency may be declared to exist, due to the fact that
such a heavy snow fall constitutes a serious public hazard. During such times,
the parking of vehicles upon public streets within the Village may hinder,
delay or obstruct the safe flow of traffic and emergency vehicles and the
cleaning, clearing and making safe of all public streets of this Village.
   (b)   Declaration of a Snow Emergency. The Mayor, the Village Administrator,
or in their absence, the President of Council, when it is determined that the
definition of a snow emergency exists, may declare such a snow emergency. Then,
upon the declaration of a Snow Emergency, said official shall take such steps
as are reasonable under the circumstances to notify residents of the Village of
the existence of a snow removal emergency by notifying the local media or such
other means as may be effective to communicate to residents. The notice shall
include the decision that all motor vehicles are to be removed from the streets
of the Village and the time period during which this removal must take place.
However, owners and operators of motor vehicles shall have the full
responsibility to be aware of existing weather conditions and to comply with
emergency parking regulations when such emergency is in effect.
   (c)   Removal of Vehicles from the Public Rights of Way. When the Mayor, the
Village Administrator, or in their absence, the President of Council, has
declared that a Snow Emergency exists, it is important that the Village Street
Department clear all public streets of accumulation of snow to allow for
necessary travel and access by emergency vehicles. To allow snow removal
operations to proceed as efficiently and safely as possible, it is necessary to
remove all vehicles parked on the Village streets or roads so that these
streets may be cleared from curb to curb. Therefore, when a Snow Emergency has
been declared, it shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of any motor
vehicle to park or permit to remain parked any vehicle on any street or road
within this Village. However, vehicles may be parked for a period of not longer
than five minutes for the loading or unloading of passengers or thirty minutes
for loading or unloading of property, provided that no other ordinance
restricting parking as to place or time is violated thereby.
   (d)   In the event that vehicles remain on the streets after the declaration
of a Snow Emergency, creating a hazard and an obstacle for snow removal
operations, the Miami County Sheriff Deputy may arrange for the removal and
storage of such motor vehicles, at the expense of the owner.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the parking of motor vehicles on
the streets of this Village after streets have been cleared of snow from curb
to curb.
   (f)   The Village Administrator is directed to cause signs to be erected at
appropriate locations advising of the provisions of this section.
   (g)   Whoever violates the provisions of this section shall, in addition to
paying the costs for removal and storage of their motor vehicle, be guilty of a
minor misdemeanor for the first offense and upon a second or subsequent offense
within one year of the first, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

opening cost, and exempt a corporation, contractor, or public utility in the
case of an opening required as a result of natural disaster. The Village
Administrator shall also have the authority to waive street opening costs due
to circumstances beyond the control of the utility involved in such related
cost shall be assessed to the contractor or entity responsible for causing the
necessity of repair.
      (4)   Permits must be obtained retroactively as a result of a break in a
utility line that may occur after normal business hours and necessities

is laid. Thereafter, during the period of three (3) years from after the final
completion of the new pavement, no new permit for making an opening in such
pavement shall be issued by the Village, except by express authority in each
case by the Village Administrator, which authority shall be exercised only for
reasons of public necessity or of undue hardship, where the necessity for
opening arises from causes over which the applicant has no control. Lack of
foresight in not installing service connections prior to the laying of new
pavement shall not be considered an adequate reason for abrogation of the three
year restriction without adherence to the street opening payment schedule as
delineated in Section
905.03, subsection (d) of this chapter.
(Ord. 23-05. Passed 4-13-23.)

located "Y" branch is available, the owner shall at his expense install a "Y"
branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the Village
Administrator. Where the public sewer is greater than twelve inches (12") in
diameter, and properly located "Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut
into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the down
screen direction at an angle of about forty five degrees (45). A forty five
degree may be used to make such connection, with the spigot and cut so as not
to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the
building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher
elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be
made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete.
Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the
Village Administrator.

929.01 BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   (a)   If, in the judgement of the Village Administrator, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Village Administrator will give notice to the water consumer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his
own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Village Administrator and shall have inspections and tests made
of such approved devices as required by the Village Administrator.
   (b)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public

method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Village Administrator and by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (c)   It shall be the duty of the Village Administrator to cause surveys and
investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated as often as the Superintendent of Water
shall deem necessary.
   (d)   The Village Administrator or his duly authorized representative shall
have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water supply or distributing system of the Village for
the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof. On demand the
owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
Village Administrator any information which he may request regarding the piping
system or systems or water use on such property. The refusal of such
information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Village
Administrator be deemed evidence of the presence of improper connections as
provided in this section.
   (e)   The Village Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he

supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored
until such conditions shall have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 87-4. Passed 2-12-87.)

the tenth (10th) of the month. If paid after the tenth (10th) day of the month,
the amount of the bill is increased by a ten percent (10%) penalty.
(Ord. 21-03. Passed 4-8-21.)

      (Ord. 11-10. Passed 9-22-11.)
929.05 WATER RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   New Water Services.
      (1)   All requests for new water service(s) shall be made on an approved
form provided by the Village Utility Department and submitted to the Village
Administrator or his Designee. Said form must be signed by the property owner
or "authorized agent”, who shall agree to be responsible for the payment of
water rents and to adhere to the regulations ofthe Village of Bradford.
      (2)   Such form shall be accompanied by the sum of one thousand dollars
($1,000) for the tap fee. For connections located outside the village the tap
fee cost will be one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500).
   (b)   Existing Services.  When water has been turned off and turned on to a
property for reasons of nonpayment, or for other violations of village rules,
the owner of said property, or his "authorized agent", shall pay any and all
delinquencies as determined by the Administrator, shall correct all violations,
and pay a charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per turn on and per turn off
or seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per turn on and turn off during after work
hours or on weekend or holidays before service will be restored.
   (c)   Responsibilities. The Village shall make all taps at the mains and
extend line to curbs. The village shall also be responsible for maintaining all
taps and lines from the tap to the curb cock, and shall furnish a meter at a
cost of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per meter (residential meter fee; larger
meters will be billed accordingly). The village will also maintain and repair
all meters, except when damage has occurred due to freezing or neglect. In this
event the total cost of repair will be billed to the property owner (time at
$25.00/hr per employee, plus the cost of materials). The property owner shall
install, furnish and keep in repair the service line from the curb cock to the
building, said service line to run directly to or through the meter, depending
on the location of the building being served. This line shall be installed in a
manner approved by the Village Administrator.
   (d)   Meter Testing.  The Utilities Department, on its own initiative may
test and correct any meter which, in its judgment, is registering incorrectly,
with or without consent of the owner. The Village shall not be responsible for
damage to pipes or valves occurring during removal or installation of meters,
where such damage is due to old or faulty plumbing. Upon request from an owner,
or his "authorized agent", and owner's agreement to pay for a test charge, the
Utility Department will remove residential meters (5/8 inch to 2 inch) and ship
to private shop for test. Upon completion of test, the owner or authorized
agent will be responsible for the following: 1) If meter registers over 102%
(considered unusable), then the Village will cover all costs and refund any
overage determined to have occurred and replace such meter; 2) If meter
registers under 96.5% (considered unusable), then the owner or authorized agent
will pay for the meter test and all charges associated with said test and the
village will replace the meter; 3) If meter registers between 102% and 96.5%
(determined functional) owner or authorized agent will pay all charges
associated with the meter test and a charge of $25.00/hr/employee for the labor
to remove meter for testing. For all other meters, a fee equal to the cost of
removing and testing of the meter will apply as to the above procedure.
   (e)   Accounting Practice and Procedure.  
      (1)   A bill for water and/or sewer service will be issued for each
billing period during which the curb stop in the service branch is listed in
the records of the Utility Department as being in the "on" or "open" position.
The charge will normally be determined from the difference between two
consecutive meter readings. When, for any reason, a meter reading has not been
obtained, the charge may be "estimated" from quantities of water used during
previous periods.
      (2)   The Village of Bradford shall give proper notice of water and/or
sewer service charges, but by law cannot guarantee delivery of mail. Failure to
receive notice shall not excuse customers from prompt payment of bills.
      (3)   It shall be the established policy of the Village, to accept only
total and complete payments for charges billed unless otherwise determined by
Administrator. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain
their piping and plumbing fixtures in good repair and only one adjustment will
be granted during a twelve month period. The leak adjustment will be calculated
by using past usage and will only be adjusted for leaks that register on the
meter. Owner shall be responsible for water used on their premises; but payment
will be accepted from an "authorized agent". If the "authorized agent" does not
pay in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Utility Department,
Village of Bradford, water will not be supplied to the property. All unpaid
accounts for water and/or sewer service shall be liens against the property
served. The authority of the municipality to discontinue or to refuse water
service when water and/or sewer charges are delinquent has been upheld by the
Courts of Ohio. This authority may be exercised even though payments of both
accounts are not normally received from the source.
   (f)   Right to Enter Premise. The Village of Bradford reserves the right for
its employees or authorized agents to enter, at all reasonable hours, the
premises to which its service extends, for the purpose of reading, repairing,
installing, removing, and/or inspecting water meters, or for any purpose which
it may deem necessary to properly safeguard the interests of the Village and
the consumer.
      (1)   When such access is refused, the service shall be immediately
discontinued and not continued again until the request of the Village has been
complied with, and an "off and on" charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or
seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for after hours, weekends or holidays has been
paid, for service within the Village for service outside the Village. The
Village may require the meter to be relocated in an approved location at such
location as the Village directs, at the expense of the property owner.
      (2)   In case of emergency there will be no "Off and On" fees charged.
Such emergency shall be determined by the Village Administrator, or authorized
agent. In the event the emergency was caused by the lack of or a malfunctioning
shut valve located directly after the meter, reconnection of water service will
not be established until such valve is replaced or fixed. Decisions may be
appealed to Village Council by submitting in writing the events that occurred
along with any additional information related to the occurrence. This request
must be submitted to the Clerk's office no later than 10 days following the
event.
   (g)   Meter Reading.
      (1)   The reading of meters by the Village will be conducted during the
months of February, May, August, November between the 15th thru the 20th,
unless circumstances prevent this from occurring; and, if so, the water
readings will be completed as soon as possible or the water readings for the
quarter will be estimated. The estimated charge will be based on the prior
quarter consumption.
      (2)   Readings will be collected by village employees by the use of a
hand held touch read system. Once contact is made by the hand held device to a
touch read pad attached to each individual residence, a reading is sent and
stored in the hand held device. The device is then connected to a computer
system and the reading is used to automatically calculate the utility charges.
   (h)   Leaking or Damaged Services. If any service is found to be leaking,
out of order, or used for any purpose other than for which it was intended, the
supply will be cut off without any prior notice. Should any meter become
inoperative or damaged from any cause, the same shall be reported to the
Administrator or Utility Department immediately.
   (i)   Waste of Water.  
      (1)   There shall be no waste of water, either to prevent freezing in the
winter or to lower the temperature in the summer; this is strictly prohibited.
      (2)   Persons violating this rule will be promptly turned off and will
not be serviced again, except upon payment of a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) or
seventy-five dollar ($75.00) for after-hours, weekends or holidays turn on and
turn off fees. The Village reserves the right to decide what shall be
considered a waste or proper use thereof, as it deems necessary.
   (j)   No Supply of Water. No owner or authorized agent of any premises
supplied with water will be permitted to supply water to other persons or
property through pipes or otherwise. Each separate property must have its own
service line and individual curb cock.
   (k)   Double Service. No double service will be permitted unless by special
action of the council when one or more parties is supplied with water from one
service pipe, and upon the failure of any one of said parties to pay the
assessment when due, the water shall be turned off at
the curb cock.
   (l)   Property Owner of "Authorized Agent" Discontinuing Service.  Any
property owner or "authorized agent" wishing to discontinue the use of water on
his premises must have completed a disconnection/connection form either by
obtaining one at the Utility Office or by calling a request in. The regular
charge will apply until such notice has been given.
   (m)   Service of Delinquents. When water is turned off due to a "Delinquent
Bill", it will not be turned on again until all delinquent charges have been
paid, together with an "Off and On" charge of twenty-five ($25.00) dollars for
services or seventy-five ($75.00) dollars for after-hours, weekends or
holidays.
   (n)   Check Valves. All boilers connected with the service pipes, must have
suitable check valves, to prevent accidents from collapse or damage in case the
water is suddenly drawn off the main pipes.
   (o)   No Claims Against the Village. It is expressly stipulated by the
Village of Bradford, that no claim shall be brought against the Village, for
damages by reason of bursting or breaking of any pipes or fixtures, within the
limits of private property, or the interruption of the supply caused by the
breakage of machinery or stoppage for necessary repairs, alterations of
extensions, or shortage of water from any cause.
   (p)   Rebate for Leaks. One time each year a leak adjustment will be allowed
and no additional adjustments will be approved from 12 months from the date of
adjustment. The adjustment will be calculated based on the average usage
determined by the past three readings prior to the leak. The average usage will
then be subtracted from the reading taken after the leak was repaired. Full
charges will be calculated on the averaged amount (water and sewer fees) and
only the water overage charges will be calculated on the leak amount. The two
charges will then be added together to make the total amount due. No leak
adjustment will be completed until leak is repaired.
   (q)   Independent Fire Lines and Sprinkling Systems. Special independent
fire lines and day sprinkling systems will be permitted upon application; all
cost must be borne by the user. A suitable and proper sized meter acceptable to
and approved by the Village shall be furnished at the applicant's expense.
Complete plans of the system must be provided to and approved by the Village.
   (r)   Water Sales to Casual Users. The Village may sell water to casual
users at the rate of fifty dollars ($50.00) per load plus an additional charge
of five dollars ($5.00) per thousand gallons. The user must secure written
permission from the Village Administrator. The person, firm, corporation, or
organization receiving the water, shall provide the containers, if applicable
and pay for the water at time of receipt.
   (s)   Tampering with Fire Hydrants.  No person, other than those duly
authorized by the Village, are permitted to open or to, in any manner, tamper
with a public fire hydrant. Contractors desiring to use water from a hydrant
for any purpose must first receive permission from the Village Administrator,
and an employee will be sent to open and close the hydrant, and supervise
the use of water therefrom. Violators of this article will be prosecuted.
   (t)   Stop Cock Must Be Installed.  All service pipes, including
replacements for supply, must be supplied or provided with an approved stop
cock on the water side of the meter, by the property owners which are easily
accessible and are so installed that the water can be shut off and
drained from the pipes and meter.
   (u)   No Cross Connections. No person, firm, or corporation, shall establish
or permit to be established, or maintain or permit to be maintained, any
connection whereby a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than
the regular public water supply of the Village of Bradford, may enter the
supply or distributing system of said Village, unless such private, auxiliary
or emergency water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply
shall have been approved by the Village of Bradford, and approved by the Ohio
Department of Health.
   (v)   Charges for Water Service Disconnection and Connections. A charge of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) will be applied to the owner or tenant each time
water service is turned on or off during normal business hours. A charge of
seventy-five dollars ($75.00) will be applied to the owner or tenant each time
water is turned on or off after normal business hours and holidays.
   (w)   Payment of Former Delinquencies. Any property owner owing a water or
sewer bill and moving to other premises where water connections are in use, or
shall thereafter be installed, shall, before being permitted to use any water
at the new location, pay all delinquencies. Parties buying property have the
duty to check and to make sure that all unpaid water or sewer bills are paid,
as unpaid water or sewer bills may become a lien on the property, the same as
assessments or taxes.
   (x)   Meter Repaired at Owner's Expense.  Meter damage by misuse, frost, or
accident or any act of carelessness or negligence will be repaired, or
replaced, by the Village at the expense of the consumer, at a charge for the
actual cost of repairs or replacement of the meter or any connection thereof.
   (y)   Payments. Net payments of water, sewer, and refuse charges are due and
payable on the tenth day of each month. Payments of utilities can be made at
the Covington Savings and Loan Bank branch in Bradford, at the Village Utility
office, the lock box located on the south side of City Building and inside the
building to the Utility Clerk office (no cash in drop boxes) or by sending
payment in the US mail. If net payment date falls on a Friday, Saturday, Sunday
or a Holiday, it shall be due on the next open business day. If not paid by the
net payment date, a penalty of 10% will be added on all bills. A payment
reminder will be sent on or about twentieth of each month. Arrearages not paid
by the second Tuesday of each month will result in disconnection and the water
shall be turned off without further notice and not turned on again until all
amounts due and back rents are paid in full. No deduction will be made for the
time the water was off and a payment of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or
seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for after-hours, weekends or holidays shall be
paid for turning the water on and off again, together with the amount of water
rent due.
   (z)   Reserved Rights of the Village. The Village reserves the right to
change the rules, regulations, and rates for the use of water at the Village
Council's discretion; to make special rates or contracts when occasion
requires; to shut off the water for non-payment of water rents, refusal to
comply with orders, rules, and regulations of the Village of Bradford, or for
alterations or repairs.

of the Village only. Unauthorized persons removing or tampering with meters may
be fined, not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (bb)   Severability. Each part of this section is hereby declared to be
separate and distinct enactment, and should any subsection be held inoperative
or void, it shall not affect the validity of any other subsection or part of
subsection.
   (cc)   General Penalty. Any person, firm, or Corporation violating any of
the provisions of this section, or as otherwise so stated herein, upon
conviction thereof, shall be deemed guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be
fined not more than one-hundred dollars ($100.00), and each day that such
Violation is not corrected shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

are hereby repealed, with the exception of any ordinance pertaining to the
issuance of any or all types of bonds.

in multiple apartment buildings, provided that the proper plumbing is installed
at the landlord/owner's expense.

951.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council that this chapter be liberally construed for the
purpose of providing a sanitary and satisfactory method of preparation,
collection and disposal of municipal refuse, litter, and other waste material.
(Ord. 80-12. Passed 11-25-80.)
951.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply:
   (a)   “Refuse” means ashes, glass, crockery, tin cans, paper, boxes, rags
and old clothing and all other similar nonputrescible wastes. The term shall
not include any material such as earth, sand, brick, stone, plaster or other
similar substance that may accumulate as a result of construction operations or
industrial processes.
   (b)   “Garbage” means all putrescible wastes except human excreta, sewage
and other water-carried wastes, including vegetable and animal offal and
carcasses of dead animals, and includes all such substances from all public and
private establishments and from all residences.
   (c)   “Rubbish” means and includes the miscellaneous waste material and
refuse from housekeeping, and include packing boxes, cartons, excelsior, paper,
ashes, cinders, tin cans, bottles, metals, rubbish, etc.
      (Ord. 80-12. Passed 11-25-80.)
951.03 CONTAINER REQUIREMENTS.
   The Village of Bradford hereby adopts an automated refuse collection system
using only those containers furnished by Best Way Disposal and subject to the
following requirements:
   (a)   The containers (hereinafter referred to as “toters”) furnished by Best
Way will be required for the storage and collection of refuse and other solid
waste at each residential and commercial location which is serviced by the
collector.
   (b)   All refuse and solid waste must be held within the toter provided by
the collector. No additional cans, containers or bags will be collected. If the
customer’s refuse and solid waste cannot be contained within the provided
toter, an additional toter or toters must be purchased.
   (c)   Best Way will furnish one toter to each customer at no cost. If
additional toters are required, Best Way will rent them to the customer at a
monthly fee per toter.
   (d)   Commercial locations must have the appropriate-sized container for the
amount of refuse and solid waste generated each week. (For example, if a
business generates enough refuse or solid waste to fill a 30 yd. dumpster, then
the business must have that size container or larger).
   (e)   On the day designated for trash collection, the toter must be placed
within four feet of the adjacent roadway.
   (f)   There must be at least three feet of clearance between each toter and
any other object (for example, a mailbox, sign, or utility pole).
   (g)   Each toter must be placed at the curb with the arrows on the lid
pointing to the street. If the toter does not have visible arrows, then the
toter should be placed so that the wheels are located away from the street.
(This will prohibit damage to the toter lid and will allow the lid to be shut
after the toter is emptied).

1137.17 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments that may
later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures
which are lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would
be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or
future amendment. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these non-
conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
continuance. Such uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
Ordinance that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district except by appeal to the Board of Appeals for
approval of specific plans. Expansions of existing non-conforming uses, where
allowed by the Board of Appeals, may be made only on property owned by the
applicant as of the effective date of this Ordinance.
   A nonconforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after the passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position
and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of
an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding
such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided
that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building
involved.
   (a)   Non-conforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding other limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance subject to the following conditions:
If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the
requirements for lot width and areas as established by this Ordinance, the
lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes
of this Ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which
does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance,
nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot
with width or area below the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
   (b)   Non-conforming Uses of Land: Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of this Ordinance as enacted or amended,
such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
      (1)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, except as provided.
      (2)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
      (3)   If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than thirty days any subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such
land is located.
      (4)   Where a non-conforming use of land by the nature of the use
requires expansion or enlargement of the land area so used in order to continue
in operation such as removal of sand, earth, stone, minerals, etc., continuance
of such operations following the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance shall
be deemed a violation.
   (c)   Non-conforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be
built under the terms of this Ordinance by reasons of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful.
   (d)   Non-conforming Uses of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure or
of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-
conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals in
collaboration with the Planning Commission may require appropriate conditions
and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Ordinance.
      (2)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a non- conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter

1145.07.
      (3)   The Board of Appeals shall determine:
         A.   Authority: If it has the authority to grant the request.
         B.   Adverse affect: That the granting of the conditional use will not
adversely affect the neighborhood in which the conditional use is to be
located.
      (4)   Conditions: In granting any conditional use permit, the Board of
Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity to
the provisions of this Ordinance and the recommendation of the Planning
Commission. The Board of Appeals shall require a bond to assure conformance to
such conditions and safeguards as may be necessary. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards shall cause the performance bond mentioned above to
be forfeited and shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and punishable
under Section
1141.99. A conditional use permit shall expire in one year after it is issued
unless actual construction has taken place or is underway except as provided
elsewhere in this Ordinance.
   (e)   Variances: To vary the strict application of any of the requirements
of this Ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow or
deep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict
application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship - not
economic in nature - that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the
land or building involved but in no other case. The fact that another use would
be more profitable is not a valid basis for legally granting a variance. No
non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same
district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other
districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance. No
variance in the strict application of this Ordinance shall be granted by the
Board of Appeals unless and until th applicant submits, and the Board concurs,
with the following:
      (1)   Condition and circumstances: That special conditions and
circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building
involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings
in the same district.
      (2)   Property rights: That literal interpretation of the provisions of
this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of property rights commonly enjoyed
by other properties in the same district under the terms of this Ordinance.
      (3)   Applicant not at fault: That the special conditions and
circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant, his agents or
prior property owners.
      (4)   No special privilege: That granting the variance requested will not
confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Ordinance
to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (5)   Harmony with locality: That the variance requested shall not alter
the essential character of the locality. In making this determination, the
Board of Appeals shall be advised by the recommendation of the Planning
Commission.
         (Ord. 0-9-71. Passed 12-23-71.)
      (6)   Variances not required: Variances will not be required for zoning
permits when all of the following conditions exist:
         A.   The structure in question existed in its present location before
the Zoning Ordinance went into effect (1971).
         B.   The remodeling, replacement or change of use will not increase
the non-conformity of front, side or rear yard requirements.
         C.   Extension or addition to the structure will not violate the yard
requirements in the direction of the addition or extension.
         D.   The reconstruction or replacement of such structure shall take
place in not more than 24 months.
            (Ord. 0-84-9. Passed 1-10-85.)
   (f)   Procedure for Consideration of Petitions for Variances:  
      (1)   The Board of Appeals shall make a finding that the reasons set
forth in the application are valid and justify the granting of the variance.
The Board shall also determine if the variance is the minimum variance that
will make possible the reasonable use of land, building or structure.
      (2)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Appeals grant a variance
which will permit a use which is not permitted in the district involved.
      (3)   Conditions: The Board of Appeals may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance and the
recommendations of the Planning Commission. The Board of Appeals shall require
a bond or irrevocable letter of credit to assure conformance to such conditions
and safeguards as the Board may require.
      (4)   Violation of such conditions and safeguards when such are made a
part of the terms under which a variance is granted, shall cause the bond
mentioned in subsection (f)(3) hereof to be forfeited and shall be deemed in
violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Section
1141.99.
      (5)   Public hearings: Prior to taking action on a request for a variance
the Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing and give notice to property
owners as in Section
1145.07.
   (g)   Effective date: The decision of the Board of Appeals shall not become
final until the expiration of five (5) days from the date of entry of such
order unless the Board shall find the immediate effect of such order is
necessary for the preservation of property or personal rights and shall so
certify on the record.

   The minimum improvements which the subdivider will be required to make or
enter into agreement to make a subdivision prior to the approval of the final
map by the Planning Board, shall be as prescribed by the following provisions.
All of these improvements shall be carried out in full compliance with the
specifications for each of the various branches of the work. Nothing in these
rules and regulations shall be construed to prohibit the subdivider from
constructing higher type of improvements than the minimum required by the
Village of Bradford as hereinafter described.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.02 STREETS.
   The subdivider shall improve all streets or highways which are a part of the
subdivision. Street shall be constructed as specified in the Village Standard
Specifications and Drawings. No final grading or sidewalk or pavement
construction or installation of utilities shall be permitted in the bed of any
proposed street or other part of the plat until the street has been officially
established and the plat approved by the Planning Board.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.03 EXCAVATIONS.
   All excavations within the dedicated right of way for sewers, water, gas,
electrical conduit, or for any other reason over 5 feet in depth shall be
shored. All trenches made or dug in existing or finished streets, whether or
not dedicated and accepted, shall be back-filled to the subgrade elevation with
gravel and the same shall be compacted either by tamping or flooding with
water.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.04 CURBS AND GUTTERS.
   Curb and gutters shall be required in all subdivisions, constructed as
specified by the Village’s Standard Specifications and Drawings.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)

Standard Specifications and Drawings.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.06 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be provided at all street intersections. The signs
shall be of the size and type approved for use by the Village of Bradford.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.07 WATER MAINS.
   Where public water supply is within reasonable distance, as determined by
the Planning Board, the subdivider or developer shall construct a system of
water mains together with all appurtenances, such as valves and curb
connections at each lot within said subdivision, and connect with such public
water supply. All water mains shall be cast iron pipe and conform to ASA
Specifications, A 21.6 (AWWA C 106). No water line less than 6-in. in diameter
will be permitted in residential areas and 8-in. in a commercial or business
district. Larger mains shall be required for manufacturing districts, depending
on type of industry. Fire hydrants of the type approved by the Village of
Bradford shall be placed not over 500 feet apart. Reference the Village of
Bradford Standard Specifications and Drawings for further requirements.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.08 STORM SEWERS.
   All necessary facilities, including underground pipe, manholes, inlets,
catch basins and other appurtenances necessary to provide adequate drainage
course shall be the responsibility of the developer up to and including a 48-
in. pipe, regardless of the size of the plat. Where a storm sewer in excess of
48-in. is necessary to provide drainage for the plat (excluding drainage from
above the plat) the cost shall be the responsibility of the developer. Where
the physical conditions are of such a character that a storm sewer in excess of
48-in. is, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, required to provide
adequate facilities for drainage generated beyond the limits of the plat, cost
of the sewer in excess of 48-in. shall be assumed by the Village. Open ditches
for drainage may be permitted where, in the judgment of the Village
Administrator, conditions are such as to require a storm sewer in excess of 48-
in. and where such open ditches will not in the judgment of the appropriate
Department of Health result in health hazards and where proper safety measures
are taken. All storm sewer and open drainage ditches shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the Village of Bradford’s Standard
Specifications and Drawings. Storm sewers may be vitrified tile,
(Specifications for Standard Strength Clay Sewer Pipe, Serial Designation C13
A.S.T.M., or Specifications for Extra Strength Clay Sewer Pipe, Serial
Designation C200 A.S.T.M.) or concrete pipe (A.S.T.M. Specifications for
Reinforced Concrete Pipe, Serial Designation C76, Wall B) of adequate load
carrying capacity.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.09 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)   Sanitary sewers together with all necessary appurtenances and curb
connections for each lot in said subdivision shall be designed and installed in
accordance with the Village of Bradford’s Standard Specifications and Drawings.
They shall be of the type referred to in Section
1168.08, and be of a size adequate to service the proposed allotment with a
minimum 8-in. diameter. In the event the tributary areas to be served through
such a sewer are, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, such as to
warrant a larger size sewer, the Village Administrator shall determine the size
of sewer in excess of that needed to serve the proposed allotment, that will be
adequate to provide such service. Any owner or subdivider shall be required to
construct such sewer of larger size only after passage by Council of such
legislation to provide for reimbursement from tap-in charges for the increased
cost of construction necessitated by such excess size. Where municipal sanitary
sewer facilities are not available, the owner or subdivider shall construct and
install such sanitary sewers and sewage treatment facilities as are deemed
necessary by the Village Administrator, State Department of Health, the
applicable Board of Health and Council. The design, installation, method of
construction and materials of the sewers and treatment facilities must be
approved by the Village Administrator, the State Department of Health and any
other authority having jurisdiction.
 
   (b)   The approval by the Village Administrator and his decision deeming the
sewers and treatment facilities necessary shall be determined by the adequacy
of the proposed facilities relative to the natural contours and topography of
the area, the proposed population density of the subdivision, and the effect of
the facilities upon abutting and adjacent property and upon the public health,
safety and welfare of the entire Municipality and any areas outside the
Municipality, which are downstream from the discharge of effluent. All sewers
excluding house service lines, must be installed in dedicated streets, must
have proper outlets approved by the Village Administrator; must serve all lots
and lands in the subdivision, and must go to the boundaries of the subdivision.
If presently existing municipal sanitary sewer lines, either within or outside
the boundaries of the proposed allotment, are inadequate to receive the
additional burden to be imposed on them by the proposed allotment, lift
stations and/or relief sewers adequate to receive such burdens shall be
installed at no cost to the Municipality. Existing septic tanks located in the
proposed allotment will be permitted to remain only until sanitary sewer
facilities to serve the area are completed and placed in operation.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.10 CROSS CONNECTIONS.
   No sewer whether storm or sanitary shall be approved or installed which is
designed to be used for the discharge of both storm water and sanitary sewage
include septic tank effluent. Storm water includes roof drain, foundation
drain, and other clean water, which may be discharged into the storm sewer.
Basement floor drains to the sanitary sewer will not be permitted.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.11 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued by the Building Inspector or Clerk for
any lot fronting on a proposed street that has not had a permanent base
installed; that is not serviced by all other permanently installed improvements
required by any section of this Code; that does not have access, by means of
streets having at least a permanent base installed, to an existing dedicated
street. If there is any failure to comply with or maintain continuing
compliance with this section or any other applicable provision of this Code not
in conflict with this section, then future building permits in the subdivision
may be denied and previously issued building permits may be revoked and any
work in progress pursuant to such issued permit shall cease and desist.

1168.12 SURVEY MONUMENTS.
   A complete survey shall be made by a registered surveyor. Permanent
reference monuments made of stone or concrete, at least 36 inches in length and
6 inches square with a suitable center point, shall be located and placed
within the subdivision. These monuments shall be placed as soon as the grading
of streets is completed and the cost of the monuments will be included in the
cost of improving the streets. Iron pin monuments 3/4 inches in diameter and 30
inches long, shall be placed by the surveyor or engineer at all points on
boundary lines where there is a change of direction and at all lot corners,
before the final acceptance of plat.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.13 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   No improvement shall be constructed prior to final approval of the plat. In
lieu of the completions of the improvements the developer shall enter into an
agreement with the municipality setting forth the construction work to be
performed, same to be secured by a bond, in the amount of 100% of the total
cost of construction, executed by a surety satisfactory to the Village. The
surety will be subject to the condition that the improvements will be
completed, within 12 months after approval, and in event they are not
completed, the Village shall proceed with the work and hold the owner and the
bonding company jointly responsible for the costs thereof. The bond shall be
subject to the approval of Council. The developer shall enter into a contract
to provide for a performance bond.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)

Village shall have the authority to enter into a written agreement, or to
accept a release type performance bond which itemizes the several phases of the
construction or installation in sequence with an amount equal to the cost of
each phase and which further provides that 90% of each amount listed may be
repaid to the subdivider upon completion and after inspection and approval of
the particular phase of such work. However, ten percent (10%) of the
performance bond shall not be released until all construction covered by bond
is completed, inspected and accepted by the Village.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)
 
1168.15 MAINTENANCE BOND.
   A one-year maintenance bond shall be required on all subdivisions to which
the subdivision ordinance applies and on which there has been a performance
bond issued. Said maintenance bond shall be in a sum to be determined by
Council and/or Village Administrator, and with a bonding surety company
authorized to do business in the State of Ohio, and preferably with the same
company or bonding person or persons that had the performance bond on the
subdivision. The 10% coverage of the performance bond referred to above, which
is not to be released until all construction has been completed and with the
final approval of the Village Council, shall not be released until said one-
year maintenance bond is in effect and a copy filed with Council.
(Ord. 0-5-73. Passed 6-5-73.)

inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the Regulations.
   (b)   Exceptional Conditions. There are exceptional circumstances or
conditions applicable to the subdivision involved.
   (c)   Absence of Detriment. The granting of variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to surrounding improvement or
subdivision.
   (d)   Conformance to the Master Plan. The granting of the variance will not
be contrary to the objectives of the Master Plan or any official plan.
   (e)   Conditions. In granting variances the Planning Board may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements so varied or modified.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)

rules of the Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order,
standard or rule of the Divisions of State Fire Marshal or Industrial
Compliance in the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and of
counties and townships, in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are
in conflict with the rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that
rules adopted and orders issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3743 prevail in the event of a conflict.

by other licensing agencies such as the Ohio State Fire Marshal, Ohio
Department of Health, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, Ohio
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Ohio Department of
Developmental Disabilities, federal agencies, or other licensing authorities.
Owners and designers should investigate these additional licensing agency
requirements to ensure they are incorporated into the building design before
submitting to the certified building department for plan approval.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3781.10 shall govern any rule or standard adopted by the Board pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4104.02 and 4105.011.

require a master plans examiner or elective plans examiners to examine the
construction documents to verify the construction indicated is in accordance
with the requirements of this Code and shall assure coordination of plan
review.
   (c)   Plan Examination by the Building Official. When the Building
Department does not have in its full-time employ a certified master plans
examiner, the certified Building Official shall examine construction documents
to determine compliance with the rules of the Board if the registered design
professional elects to submit construction documents that contain a written
certification by the registered design professional indicating conformance with
the requirements of the rules of the Board and Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and
3791.
   (d)   Orders. The Building Official shall issue all orders in accordance

determinations as are necessary to determine whether or not the work which has
been performed and the installations which have been made are in conformity
with the approved construction documents. The Building Official shall identify
any special conditions that would affect the timing of inspections and schedule
inspections times mutually agreed upon by the Building Official and the owner.
      (2)   Special inspections are as required under Section 1704 of the Ohio
Building Code.

submission of reports and any requested special information to the Board of
Building Standards as required in paragraph (F) of Rule 4101: 7-2-01 of the
Administrative Code. Failure to submit these reports as required by rule or by
special request or inquiry of the Board of Building Standards may be grounds
for Board action as described in paragraph (F)(7) of Rule 4101:7-3-01 of the
Administrative Code.
   (h)   Liability. Liability of certified Building Department personnel for
any tortious act will be determined by Ohio courts to the applicable provisions
