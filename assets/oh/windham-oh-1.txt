   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Windham, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF WINDHAM,
OHIO:

Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any persons from punishment for an act
committed in the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

without deduction of Federal Taxes based on income, and without deducting taxes
imposed by this chapter.
      In determining, “net profits”, the following considerations shall be
included:
      (1)    Where necessary to properly reflect income, inventories must be
used.  The basis of pricing used for the purpose of the Federal Income Tax must
in each instance be used.
      (2)   Where the books and records are kept on an “accrual basis”, “long-
term contract basis”, or “installment basis”, and said basis is used in the
filing of Federal Income Tax Returns, the same basis must be used for the
purpose of this tax.
      (3)   If the return is made on a “cash basis”, Gross Profit shall
include  commissions, fees and interest earned, plus the gross profit or loss
from the sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes,
choses-in- action and services, except as hereinafter provided.
      (4)   If the return is made on an “accrual basis”, Gross Profit shall
include  commissions, fees and interest earned, plus the gross profit or loss
from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes, choses-
in- action and services, except hereinafter provided.
      (5)   From Gross Profit there shall be subtracted allowable expense to
arrive at the net profits subject to tax.
      (6)   All ordinary and necessary expense of doing business, including
reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed (but no deduction may
be
claimed for “salary” or withdrawals of a proprietor or of the partners, members
or other co-owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise).
      (7)   If not claimed as part of the Cost of Goods Sold or elsewhere in
the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction for
depreciation...depletion...obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or
casualty not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, of property used in the
trade or business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the
purpose of the Federal Income Tax.
      (8)   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, but in no event shall the amount allowed
exceed the amount recognized as a deduction for the purpose of the Federal
Income Tax.
      (9)   Only taxes directly connected with the taxpayer’s business may be
claimed as a deduction.  If for any reason the income from property is not
subject to tax, then the tax on and other expenses of said property are not
deductible.  In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income:
         A.     The tax under the chapter;
         B.     Any Federal taxes based upon income;
         C.     Gifts, estate or inheritance taxes; and
         D.     Taxes and/or special assessments for local benefits or
improvements to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof.
      (10)   Capital gains and losses (including gains or losses from the sale,
exchange, or other disposition of depreciable business property, and real
property used in the taxpayer’s trade or business) shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at Net Profits Earned.
      (11)    If the taxpayer is a non-resident, only the amount of net profits
applicable to the activities of the business in Windham shall be subject to
tax.  If the non-resident taxpayer’s records do not disclose the actual net
profits for the Windham branch, office, store, or activity separately, then the
basis of allocation shall be disclosed in the return.  If such basis of
allocation is not deemed correct, in view of all the known circumstances, the
Fiscal Officer will make a reallocation based upon gross receipts or any other
basis which shall, under the circumstances of the case, more accurately reflect
the net profits.
      (12)   In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent
allowed as such for the purpose of determining Federal Income Tax will be
recognized and allowed for determining Windham Income Tax under the provisions
of this chapter. However, all expense connected with the acquisition or
carrying of securities, the income from which is not recognized as taxable
under this chapter, may not be deducted in determining taxable net profits
hereunder.
      (13)   In general, unearned income is not to be included in computing the
tax levied hereunder.  Income from intangibles by way of dividends interest and
the like, should not be included if the property from which such income is
derived is subject to taxation under the Intangible Personal Property Tax Laws
of the State of Ohio, or is specifically exempted from taxation under said
laws.
      (14)    Rentals  received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and
to the extent that the rental, ownership, management, or operation of the real
estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or
operated by taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives)
constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (15)   Following are the circumstances under which, in any instance, the
rental of any real property shall or shall not be deemed to be a “Business
Activity”:
         A.     Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax; provided that in case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farms, whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates a
rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income
exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
         B.   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
         C.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         D.   Real property, as the term is used in this regulation, shall
include commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and
all other types of real estate.
         E.   In determining the taxable net income from rentals, the
deductible expense shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are
allowed by the Department of Internal Revenue for Federal Income Tax Purposes.
         F.   Residents of Windham are subject to taxation upon the net income
from rentals (to the extent above specified) regardless of the location of the
real property owned.
         G.   Non-residents of Windham are subject to such taxation only if the
real property is situated within the Village of Windham.  Non- residents, in
determining whether gross monthly rentals exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00)
shall take into consideration only real estate situated within Windham Village.
      (16)   Income from royalties or copyrights is not to be included.
   (o)   “Non-resident” means an individual, partnership, limited partnership,
corporation, association or other entity domiciled outside the Village of

named or defined and includes, inter alia, fiduciaries located within the
Village of Windham.
   (q)   “Person” means every natural person, partnership, limited partnership,
fiduciary, association or corporation.  Whenever used in any clause prescribing
and imposing a penalty, the term “person” as applied to any unincorporated
entity or association means the partners or members thereof and as applied to
corporations, the officers thereof.
   (r)   “Place of business” means any bona fide office (other than a mere
statutory office) factory, warehouse or other space which is occupied and used
by the taxpayer in carrying on any business activity whether individually or

business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the Village of
Windham shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit
is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the Village of Windham, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Village of Windham for purposes of
municipal income taxation.  In the absence of such records, net profit from a
business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of the
Village of Windham shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village
of Windham for purpose of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as
the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village of Windham during the taxable period to the average net book value of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, “real property” includes property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable

in the Village of Windham to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during
the same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever
their services are performed;
      (3)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village of Windham to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services wherever made or performed.
In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
with the approval of the Administrator, so as to produce such results.
 
    (b)    As used in subsection (a) hereof, “sales made in the Village of
Windham” means:
      (1)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Windham regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within the Village of Windham;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Windham regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside the Village of Windham if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within
the Village of Windham and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of Windham to purchasers outside the Village of
Windham regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
(Ord. 1455.  Passed 12-9-97.)
 
181.041 TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   (a)   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
181.04(a) or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving the total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
181.04.
 
   (b)   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Village. 
(Ord. 1455.  Passed 12-9-97.)
 
181.05  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   Filing consolidated returns may be permitted or required in accordance
with regulations prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
 
   (b)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operated
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the Village of Windham.  If the
Tax Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the Village
by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related
by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other
method, he shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair
and proper allocation of net profits to the Village.
(Ord. 1455.  Passed 12-9-97.)
 
181.051 OPERATING LOSS; CARRY FORWARD.
   (a)   No portion of net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to November 18, 1970, allocable to the Village may be applied
against the portion of the profit of any succeeding tax years.  No portion of a
net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
 
   (b)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the
Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to the
Village.

submitted with each return filed by a taxpayer subject to the Federal Income
Tax, a reconciliation between the amount of income shown in the return filed
with the Administrator and the business income reported to the Federal Internal
Revenue Department.
      (6)   If, as a result of a change in business income as determined by the
Federal Internal Revenue Department or by a Judicial decision, an additional
amount will result as owing to the Village, a report of such change shall be
filed with the taxpayer within thirty (30) days after receipt of the final
notice of such change from the Federal Authorities or after final decision of
the Court adjudicating any such Federal Income Tax liability.

   (c)   The Administrator may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the  request of the filer for a period not to exceed six (6) months, or

No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and
the final tax paid within the period as extended.
 
   (d)   (1)   The person making a return, shall at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Administrator the amount of tax shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.09, or where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.10, or where the income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with and pursuant to Sections
181.09,
181.10 and
181.18, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance,
if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   A person who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village is
entitled under the provisions of this Chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded. 
         (Ord. 1455.  Passed 12-9-97.)
 
   (e)   All employers, businesses, contractors or subcontractors who do work
in the Village of Windham shall register with the Income Tax Department of the
Village of Windham and shall present thereto a list of all employees,
subcontractors, contractors or others who may do work for them whose profits,
wages or earnings are not presently subject to withholding of the Village of
Windham Income Tax.  Further, all employers, businesses, contractors or
subcontractors have a continuing duty to notify the Village of Windham Income
Tax Department of any additional employees, subcontractors, contractors or
others when such new employee, subcontractor, contractor or other are hired or
contracted with or by such employer, business, contractor or subcontractors
thereof.  (Ord. 2009-13.  Passed 5-27-09.)
   (f)   Tax Registration Requirements For All Contracted Work Within the
Village.
      (1)   All contractors involved in any project within the incorporated
Village limits, whether general contractor, subcontractor or other, must be
identified and registered with the Village of Windham Tax Department.  Such
registration shall be required before any permit from the Housing, Planning and
Zoning Office will be issued for the project.  The general contractor, or owner
if self-contracted, is responsible for notifying any additional contractors
brought into the project after the start of the project that income tax
registration is required.
      (2)   In the event that an unregistered contractor is discovered
performing work within the Village of Windham’s limits, the Village of Windham
Income Tax Department, the Village Administrator, the Water Superintendent, the
Wastewater Superintendent, any member of the Municipal Police Department, the
Building Inspector, the Zoning Inspector, the Mayor, and any member of Council,
shall have the authority to stop work on the project until such time as
contractor or contractors are in registration compliance.  The Village of
Windham Income Tax Department shall also have the authority to stop any project
where the contractor or contractors are registered but one or more is
delinquent in filing Village Income Tax or paying Village Income Tax to the
Village of Windham.
      (3)   All contractors, including the owner if the project was self-
contracted, shall provide a listing of any and all contractors or
subcontractors who worked with or for them, classified by tax year, within the
Village of Windham’s limits.  Such list shall be included with the annual
income tax return of the contractor or owner.  (Ord. 2010-3.  Passed 4-28-10.)
 
181.08  AMENDED RETURNS/AUDITS.
   (a)   Where necessary an amended return shall be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
181.14 and
181.18.  Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable, on request, from
the Administrator.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
 
   (b)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any Federal
Tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Windham liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of Federal Tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
 
   (c)   The Administrator is hereby authorized to audit all returns submitted,
and, where an error is detected, correct the error and amend the return.
 
   (d)   In the event that the Administrator’s audit of any returns,
disclosures or other forms results in an amendment of said return, disclosure
or other form which discloses that the taxpayer underpaid the amount of tax due
or otherwise did not pay or submit all taxes or withholdings which the amended
return, disclosure or other form reflects are due, the Administrator is hereby
authorized and entitled to assess and collect any withholding at source and/or
underpayment of tax by any taxpayer with respect to earnings or net profits, or
both.  The Administrator may also levy and collect all applicable interest and
penalties.
 
   (e)   In any circumstance in which the Administrator becomes aware that no
return, disclosure or other form has been filed when one is required by this
Chapter, that said return, disclosure or other form would have reflected that a
tax or other withholding was required to be paid by the taxpayer or employer in
question, and that the Administrator can, with reasonable certainty, establish
the amount of tax or withholding due to the Village, the Administrator is
hereby authorized and entitled to establish that as the amount due and owing,
may levy and collect such amounts established as due and owing, and may also
levy and collect all applicable interest and penalties. 
(Ord. 1455.  Passed 12-9-97.)
 
181.09  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.

the employer to his employees who are subject to the provisions of this
Chapter.  In making such deduction at the time of payment, the employer shall
compute the tax to the nearest full cent.  Each employer shall, on or before
the end of the month following the close of each calender quarter, make a
return and pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted, subject to
the provisions of subsections (d), (e) and (g) hereof.
Returns shall be on a form prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and
shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the
Administrator.  Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax
required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact
been withheld.  Such approval for quarterly filings and payments may be
withdrawn by the Administrator when it is to the best interest of the Village
to do so.
All employers who or which maintain of office or other place of business in
Windham are required to make the collections and deductions in this article
specified, regardless of the fact that the services on account of which any
particular deduction is required as to residents of the Village were performed
at a place of business of any such employer situated outside of the Village.
      (2)   Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax at the source is
liable directly to the Village for the payment of such tax, whether those funds
are actually collected by the employer or not.  In the event the employer is a
corporation, it shall be the responsibility, jointly and severally, of the
president and treasurer of each corporation required to withhold taxes on
employee’s wages, to see that all taxes so withheld are paid to the Village in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  In the event taxes withheld
are not paid to the Village in accordance with the provisions of this chapter,
the president and treasurer of such corporation shall each be criminally liable
under provisions of this chapter.
 
   (b)   Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold to same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Village as a trustee for the
benefit of the Village and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer until such funds are paid to the Village.
 
   (c)   On or before January 31 of each year beginning with the tax year 1971,
each employer shall file a withholding return in a form prescribed by and
obtainable, upon request, from the Administrator, setting forth the names and
addresses of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calender year and the amount of tax withheld from his employees
and such other information as may be required by the rules and regulations
adopted by the Administrator.
 
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about
such person’s residence, even though such residence is in the Village, but such
employee shall be subject to all the requirements of this chapter.
 
   (e)   Such employer who deducts the tax of two hundred dollars ($200.00) or
more per month shall pay the Administrator before the fifteenth (15th) of the
following month the amount of taxes so deducted on a monthly basis beginning
with the first (1st) month the employer exceeds two hundred dollars ($200.00)
in taxes withheld.  The monthly withholding requirement may be waived by the
Administrator if proof of quarterly filing of Federal withholding is provided.
 
   (f)   Payments shall be on a form furnished by or obtainable upon request
from the Administrator.
 
   (g)   Any taxpayer who files a return for a fiscal year different from the
calender year shall file and pay withholding taxes monthly.
 
   (h)   The failure of any employer, either residing within or outside the
Village, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall not
relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with this
chapter and any rules or regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter
concerning the making of returns and the payment of taxes.

this section for failing to file with the Income Tax Administrator the report
required by this section, a property owner or other responsible party who then
files the required report may be assessed an administrative fee in the amount
of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  After payment of the administrative
fee the Tax Administrator shall then dismiss the pending enforcement
proceedings at the property owners cost.  The payment of the administrative fee
and dismissal of the pending prosecution shall only be available to property
owners who are charged with a first offense under this section.  This fee is to
cover the expenses incurred by the Village in the administration and bringing
of the charges and is not a penalty.  It is intended that this fee will
reimburse the Village for the administrative expenses in bringing the
enforcement action only.

181.10  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer whose entire wages, salaries, other compensation, net

withholding provisions under this chapter, whose tax will accordingly be
withheld as to his entire earnings for such a year, and who during such taxable
year expects to derive no other compensation or other income which is subject
to tax under this chapter, need not file a declaration as provided by this
Section.
      (2)   A declaration of estimated tax shall be filed by every taxpayer who
reasonably may be expected to have taxable income earnings and/or net profits,

the event that a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a return,
the declaration of estimated tax shall be based on a good faith estimate of the
taxpayer’s estimated income for the current taxable year; provided, however,
that any declaration of estimated tax which reports less than eighty percent
(80%) of the tax imposed on estimated income in the final return, or as
determined by the Administrator to be imposed, shall conclusively be presumed
not to have been filed in good faith.

within four (4) months after the beginning of each fiscal year or period.

Income Tax purposes may, in making his declaration required hereunder, simply
state herein that the figures therein contained are the same figures used by
the taxpayer in making the declaration of his estimate for the Federal Income
Tax.  However, in addition to such statement, any such taxpayer may, in such
declaration, modify and adjust such declared income so as to exclude therefrom
income which is not subject to tax under this chapter.
      (2)   The original estimate of tax liability or any subsequent amendment
thereof, as set forth in a declaration of estimated tax, may be increased or
decreased by filing an amended declaration on or before a quarterly payment
date, as set forth in subsection (d)(1) hereof, upon a form or forms furnished

balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.
 
   (e)   The filing of a declaration of estimated tax does not relieve the
taxpayer of the necessity of filing a final return even though there is no
change in the declared tax liability.

failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after
three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is later. 
However, in those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the
taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of limitations, the
period within which an additional assessment may be made by the Administrator
shall be one year from the time of the final determination of the Federal tax
liability.

the tax to which the Village is entitled under the provisions of this chapter,
a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made, provided a proper claim for

refunds shall be made on forms prescribed by and obtained from the
Administrator.

tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
182.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also

withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.  Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under section
182.091 of this Chapter.

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the

employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer

for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in

amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
      If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   “Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
182.03(12) of this Chapter.

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable

the same proportion as the average ration of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title

         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.

   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
182.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,
2016.

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
                 (a)     On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
                 (b)     On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
                 (c)     On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month
after the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
                 (d)     On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)     A Taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the

(d) of this section.
      (3)     On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
182.091 of this Chapter.
                 (a)     For  Taxpayers who are reporting and filing on a
calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due on the same date as the
filing of the federal tax return, unless extended pursuant to division (G) of
section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
                 (b)     For  Taxpayers who are not individuals, and are
reporting and filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar

following the end of the taxable year or period.
            (4)     An amended declaration is required whenever the  Taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)     (1)     In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
                 (a)     For the first payment of estimated taxes each year,
twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
                 (b)     For the second payment of estimated taxes each year,
forty-five per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of
taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

ninety per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
            (2)     The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
 
   (E)     An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)     The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)     The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the Taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the Taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091 of this Chapter for that year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/
ordinance may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the
tax paid to the other municipality, not to exceed tax paid outside of the
Village up to a maximum of one-half of one percent.  Subject to division (B) of
this section, the credit shall not exceed the tax due the Municipality under
this chapter.
   (B)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, the amount of
the credit issued against the Village of Windham income tax obligation shall be
calculated based on the amount of tax actually paid to the other municipality.

under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section 182.096, the Municipality may allow a non-refundable credit
equal to the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality against the
income tax the Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is
higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates is also
subject to collection by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest
accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
182.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.

information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.  (Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
182.051 of this Chapter. 
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment.  For purposes of this
section, “receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of funds from the
account of the taxpayer.  Such funds are no longer under the control of the
taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
         (Ord. 2016-22.  Passed 11-8-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or

182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law.  The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.  (Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a written
request that the tax administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of
the date for filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request
is received by the tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income
tax return is due, the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the

this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
182.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of section
182.19 of this Chapter  for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section

the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with

shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. 
         (Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.18  BOARD OF TAX APPEALS.
   (A)    (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever the Administrator issues a decision regarding a municipal
income tax obligation that is subject to appeal as provided in this section or
in an Ordinance or regulation of the village, the Administrator shall notify
the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the taxpayer's right to appeal the
decision and of the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the decision.
   (C)   Any person who is aggrieved by a decision by the Administrator and who
has filed with the village the required returns or other documents pertaining
to the municipal income tax obligation at issue in the decision may appeal the
decision to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The appeal shall be
in writing, shall state why the decision should be deemed incorrect or
unlawful, and shall be filed within thirty days after the Administrator issues
the decision from which the appeal is brought.
   (D)   The Board shall schedule a hearing within forty-five (45) days after
receiving the request, unless the taxpayer waives a hearing. If the taxpayer
does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear before the Board and may be
represented by an Attorney at Law, Certified Public Accountant, or other
representative.
   (E)   Two of the members of the Board of Tax Appeals (either standing or
regular members or an alternate member appointed in conformity with subsection
(A)(1) hereof) shall constitute a quorum and shall be the number needed to take
action as a Board.  This majority of the Board may affirm, reverse, or modify
the Administrator's decision or any part of that decision. The Board shall
issue a decision on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the Board's final
hearing on the appeal, and send notice of its decision by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing the
decision. The taxpayer or the Administrator may appeal the Board's decision as
provided in the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Board may adopt rules governing its procedures and shall keep a
record of its transactions. Such records are not public records available for
inspection under Section 149.43 of the Revised Code.  Hearings requested by a
taxpayer before the Board are not meetings of a public body subject to Section
121.22 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
181.21  REQUIRING OWNERS OF RENTAL OR LEASED PROPERTY LOCATED WITHIN THE
VILLAGE TO PROVIDE THE IN COME TAX ADMINISTRATOR WITH INFORMATION OF TENANTS.
   (A)   Beginning October 1, 2005, and thereafter, within thirty days after a
new tenant occupies residential or business property of any kind within the
Village, all property owners of rental or leased residential or business
property who rent to tenants or businesses, shall file with the Income Tax
Administrator of the Village a report showing the names and addresses of each
such tenant or business who occupies residential or business premises within
the corporation limits of the Village.
   (B)   Beginning October 1, 2005, and thereafter, within thirty days after a
tenant vacates a rental or leased residential or business property located
within the Village, the property owner of such rental or leased property shall
file with the Income Tax Administrator of the Village, a report showing the
date of vacating from the rental or leased residential property and identifying
such vacating tenant; and providing the forwarding address for such tenant.
 
   (C)   For the purposes of this section, "tenant" means:
      (1)   If there is a written lease or rental agreement, the person or
persons who sign the written lease or rental agreement with the owner.
      (2)   If there is an oral lease or rental agreement, the person or
persons with whom the owner enters into the oral lease or rental agreement.
      (3)   All persons of eighteen years of age or older who occupy the
premises.
      (4)   Any business, corporation, LLC, partnership, sole proprietor or
other entity who occupies the premises.
         
   (D)   Whosoever shall violate the provisions of this section shall:
      (1)   For a first offense be guilty of a minor misdemeanor;
      (2)   For a second offense be guilty of a fourth degree misdemeanor; and
      (3)   For a third and all subsequent offenses be guilty of a third degree
misdemeanor.
   (E)   If after the commission of enforcement proceedings brought pursuant to
this section for failing to file with the Income Tax Administrator the report
required by this section, a property owner or other responsible party who then
files the required report may be assessed an administrative fee in the amount
of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  After payment of the administrative
fee the Tax Administrator shall then dismiss the pending enforcement
proceedings at the property owners cost.  The payment of the administrative fee
and dismissal of the pending prosecution shall only be available to property
owners who are charged with a first offense under this section.  This fee is to
cover the expenses incurred by the Village in the administration and bringing
of the charges and is not a penalty.  It is intended that this fee will
reimburse the Village for the administrative expenses in bringing the
enforcement action only.
(Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)
182.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.

182.98  SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter.  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-13.  Passed 11-24-15.)

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That

to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests

municipal corporation.

When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs

of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section.
      (2)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.
      (4)   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or

vehicle all photographs taken under subsection (d) of this section.  Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all

electronic, or otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (4)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from
private property that is established as a private tow-away zone under this
section, or store such a vehicle other than in accordance with this section, or
otherwise fail to comply with any applicable requirement of this section.
   (i)   This section does not affect or limit the operation of Ohio R.C.

303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. 
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using a handheld electronic wireless communications device, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.204 except when utilizing any of the following:
            1.   The device’s speakerphone function;

            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
Municipality.
      (3)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is found to be false,
misleading or incomplete in any material detail.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street, after
stopping.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the
provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted to enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow signal indication, after stopping.  The right to proceed
with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow, and
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

315.03  OFFENSE.
   (a)    The vehicle owner shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to
this Ordinance if such vehicle is operated at a speed in excess of those set
forth in Section
333.03 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Windham, Ohio or Ohio
Revised Code Section 4511.21 as each may be amended from time to time, provided
that:
      (1)    For a system location that is located within a school zone or
within the boundaries of a state or local park or recreation area, the Village
shall not issue a violation as described in this Chapter using an automated
traffic law enforcement system unless the vehicle involved in the violation is
traveling at least six miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
      (2)    For a system location that is located within any other location
than those described in Section
315.03(a)(l) above, the Village shall not issue a violation as described in
this Chapter using an automated traffic law enforcement system unless the
vehicle involved in the violation is traveling at least ten miles per hour over
the posted speed limit.
   (b)    A person or entity who receives a notice of liability or ticket for a
civil violation shall elect to do one of the following:
      (1)    In accordance with the instructions on the notice of liability,
pay the civil penalty, hereby failing to contest liability and waiving the
opportunity to contest the violation;
      (2)(i)   Within thirty days after receipt of the notice of liability,
provide the Village of Windham Police Department with either of the following
affidavits:
         A.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered  owner at the time
of the violation,  identifying that person as a designated party who may be
held liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address
of the designated  party; or
         B.   An affidavit  by the vehicle owner stating that at the time of
the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates of the motor vehicle
involved were stolen or  were in the care, custody, and control of some person
who did not have the owner's permission to use the motor vehicle, or that the
motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the
violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at
the time of the violation. In order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or
license plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the
control or possession of the vehicle owner at the  time of the violation, the
vehicle owner must submit proof that a police report, incident report/general
offense report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed prior
to the violation or within 48 hours after the violation
            A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within thirty days after the date of mailing of the notice of liability,
the registered owner furnishes an affidavit specified in Section
315.03(b)(2)A. or B. to the Village in a form established by the Village and
the following conditions are met:
      (2)(ii)   A.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified
in Section
315.03(b)(2)(i)A. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request
an administrative hearing within thirty days or is determined liable in an
administrative hearing;
         B.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
Section
315.03(b)(2)(i)B. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division;
         C.   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the Village of Windham Police Department
of the name and address of the lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the
time of the traffic law violation. A motor vehicle leasing dealer or motor
vehicle renting  dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged traffic law
violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring device is not liable for a
ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of
a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation. The dealer shall not
pay such a ticket or notice of liability and subsequently attempt to collect a
fee or assess the lessee or renter a charge for any payment of such a ticket
made on behalf of the lessee or renter.
         D.   If the vehicle involved  in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the notice of liability is issued to a corporate
entity, provide to the Village  of Windham Police Department an affidavit,
sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the corporate entity,  that provides the
name and address of the employee who was operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation and who is the designated party.
         E.   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the notice of liability. The person or entity
shall file the written request not later than thirty days after receipt of the
notice of liability.  The failure to request a hearing within this time period
constitutes a waiver of the right to contest the violation and notice of
liability and is deemed to constitute an admission of liability and waiver of
the opportunity to contest the violation.
   (c)   In the event that the Village and/or the Village of Windham Police
Department receives from a registered owner an affidavit described in
315.03(b)(2)(i)A. or B. or a notice described in
315.03(b)(2)(ii)C. or D.) hereof, the Village may proceed to send a notice of
liability that conforms with Section
315.04 to the designated party. The Village shall send the notice of liability
to the designated party not later than twenty-one days after receipt of the
affidavit or notification.
   (d)    A certified copy of the notice of liability alleging the violation of
this chapter occurred, sworn to or affirmed by a law enforcement officer of the
Village of Windham Police Department, with the recorded images produced by an
automated traffic law enforcement system photographic system shall be prima
facie evidence of the facts contained therein and shall be admissible in a
proceeding alleging a violation under this chapter.
   (e)    Exception for emergency or public safety vehicles:  The provisions of
this chapter shall not apply to the registered owner of emergency vehicles or
public safety vehicles when those vehicles are responding to emergency or call
for emergency service.

in Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.098 or Village of Windham Codified Ordinances
Sections
315.03 or
315.07 is deemed to be an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity
to contest the violation.

later than thirty (30) calendar days after the alleged violation.
   (c)    Except as provided under Section

the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (or with any other
applicable state vehicle registration office) was operating the vehicle at the
time of the offense set out in Section
315.03(a). This evidence and presumption may be rebutted in accordance with
Section
315.03(b) or
315.07 of this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Windham.
   (e)     Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the liability of

   (a)    A registered owner or designated party may contest the notice of
liability by filing a written request for an administrative hearing to review
the notice of liability with the Village police department or its designee. A
written notice of request for an administrative hearing must be received by the
Village police department, or its designee, within thirty (30) calendar days
after the date of issuance of the notice of liability. The failure to give
notice of request for an administrative hearing within this time period shall
constitute a waiver of the right to contest the notice of liability. A hearing
officer shall conduct administrative hearings. Administrative hearings shall be
held within forty-five (45) business days of the date that timely request for a
hearing is received by the Village or its designee, but not sooner than twenty-
one days from receipt by the Village of such request; this time may be extended
upon a reasonable written request for additional time or upon reasonable
notification of the hearing officer or Village with notice to all parties.  The
administrative hearing shall be open to the public, and a hearing schedule
shall be posted in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the hearing room
that shall identify, by alleged violator, the administrative hearings scheduled
for that day and the time of each hearing.  More than one hearing may be
scheduled for the same time to allow for such things as non-appearances or
admissions of liability.
      (1)    The Hearing Officer shall determine whether a preponderance of
evidence establishes that a traffic law violation occurred and the person
requesting the administrative hearing is the party operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation. The hearing officer shall advise the person or entity on
the day of the hearing of the Hearing Officer's decision.
         (i)    If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the notice of liability  is the person who was operating the
vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a written
decision imposing liability for the violation upon  the individual  or entity
and submit it to the Village of Windham or  its designee and the person or 
entity  named  in  the  notice  of liability.
         (ii)     If the  hearing  officer  finds  by  a  preponderance  of 
the evidence that  the alleged  traffic  law violation  did not occur or did in
fact occur but the person or entity named in the notice of liability is not the
person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing
officer shall issue a  written decision finding that the individual or entity
is not  liable for the violation and submit it to the Village of Windham or its
designee and the person or entity named in the notice of liability.
         (iii)    If the person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing  fails to appear at the
hearing, the hearing officer shall determine that the person or entity is
liable for the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the local authority or its designee  and the person or
entity named in the notice of liability.
   (b)    If the registered owner or designated party chooses to contest the
notice of liability, the Hearing Officer may consider any of the following as
an affirmative defense to a violation upon the defense being established by a
preponderance of the evidence by the registered owner or responsible party:
      (1)    That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and were not under control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation. In order to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen before the
traffic law violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation, the vehicle
owner must submit proof that a police report, incident report/general offense
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed prior to the
violation or within 48 hours after the violation occurred.
      (2)    That the motor vehicle was under the custody and/or control of
another person at the time of the violation. In order to establish this, the
owner or responsible person must provide the name and address of the person who
had custody and/or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law
violation.
      (3)    That this section is unenforceable because the recorded image is
not legible enough to determine the information needed.
      (4)    Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to Section
315.07(b)(l), that the registered owner or person named in the notice of
liability was not operating the  motor vehicle at the time of the violation. To
satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the owner or person named
in the notice of liability shall provide to the Hearing Officer evidence
showing the identity of the person who was operating the motor vehicle at the
time  of the traffic law violation, including, but  not limited  to, the
operator's name and current  address, and any other evidence the Hearing
Officer  deems pertinent.
      (5)    That the motor vehicle operator was yielding  the right-of-way to
an emergency vehicle in accordance with Ohio law, or to a funeral procession.
      (6)    That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to yield
the right-of-way to either of the following: (i) a public safety vehicle or
coroner's vehicle in accordance with section 4511.45 of the Ohio Revised Code;
or (ii) a funeral procession in accordance with Section 4511.451 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (7)    At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
      (8)    That under consideration of the totality of the circumstances the
person or entity named in the notice of liability is not liable.
   (c)    If the Hearing Officer finds that the person or entity named in the
notice of liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence under Section
315.07(b)(4) identifying the designated party, the Hearing Officer shall
provide it to the Village of Windham or its designee within five (5) calendar
days, along with a copy of any evidence substantiating  who was operating the
motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
      (1)    Upon receipt of evidence of the responsible party pursuant to this
Section or pursuant to Section
315.03(b), the Village of Windham or its designee may issue a notice of
liability, with the name and address of the designated party and the
information required  by Section
315.04 of this Chapter, to the person that the evidence indicates was operating
the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
      (2)    A notice of liability issued under this Section
315.07(c), shall be sent by the Village of Windham or its designee by ordinary
mail no later than twenty-one (21) business days after  the receipt of the
evidence from the Hearing Officer. The content of a notice of liability issued
under this subsection shall be the same as set forth in division (a) of Section
315.04.
      (3)    If a designated party who was issued a notice of liability under
Section

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.

sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who
signed the report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit

court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under
Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  The court may grant unlimited driving
privileges with an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may
reduce the period of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.  If the

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.
   (l)   Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension.  If a person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident

   (o)   Conflict of Terms.  All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to

affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in

501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense involving misconduct in
office by a public servant as defined in Section
525.01, at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process which commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings thereon are set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. 
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the

Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become    inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution. 
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. 
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic
violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
         B.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the
amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine
the extent of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount of
the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing provided that the amount of
restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or services
stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the court decides to impose
restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the
offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court
holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the
burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution
sought from the offender.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender
pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved.  All

principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.

this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Solicitor in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Solicitor to prepare and
issue an order under Board direction requiring the person complained against to
cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative action
as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice that if the Board
determines that the person complained against has not after fifteen calendar
days following service of the Board’s order complied with the order, the Board
will recertify the matter to the Solicitor for enforcement.
   (j)   Upon recertification the Solicitor shall seek compliance by
appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the

damages, along with attorney fees.  The Court may also order such other relief
as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (k)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon

against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section

545.15 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

      (12)   The Village shall maintain and repair house sewer laterals lying
within established easements and within the right-of-way limits of dedicated
public streets and alleys, except when and where prohibited wastes of non-
wastewater characteristics have been allowed to enter the same and which
contribute to the obstruction of flow within the sewer lateral and render
repairs or maintenance necessary.
      (13)   Before the Village shall undertake maintenance of or repairs of
any such house lateral, the property owner shall notify the Village of the
stoppage who will in return require a licensed sewer cleaning contractor to
locate the exact location of the stoppage and determine if the stoppage is
within the Village right-of way or established easement.
      (14)   For grease, oil, petroleum products, inorganic material and other
materials as listed in the Ohio Building Code such as sand, grit, etc.,
interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the Administrator they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable
grease in excessive amounts, as specified in subsection (g)(2) or any flammable
wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters of dwelling units.  All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Administrator and
shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.  In the maintaining of these interceptors the owner(s) shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the
captured material and shall maintain records of dates, and means of disposal
which are subject to review by the Administrator.  Any removal and hauling of
the collected materials not performed by the owner(s)’ personnel must be
performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
      (15)   In those cases where the Village constructs and installs a
sanitary sewer at its cost where the sewer has been damaged and required by the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency or Board of Health regulation, the
sanitary sewer connection permit fee for each abutting property owner shall be
equal to the pro rata cost of installation of the sewer. 
   (e)   Sewer Tapper’s License, Qualifications and Bond.
      (1)   No person shall install septic tanks or shall tap, open or make
connections with any sanitary or combined sewer within the Village or cause the
same to be done without first having procured a license to do so as hereinafter
provided.  Any person desiring to install septic tanks or to tap, open or make
connections with such sewer or engage in the business of sewer tapping and make
sewer connections with the public sewers or drains, shall make application in
writing for such license to the Administrator.  The Administrator shall examine
or cause to be examined the qualifications of such applicant for such license
and shall grant a license if the applicant is found to be qualified therefor
and complies with all other requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The applicant must have a minimum of four (4) years of acceptable
experience in the installation of septic tanks and construction of sewer
lines.  At least two (2) years of this experience shall be as a foreman or

of sewer trenching equipment, such as a crane or backhoe, or equivalent
experience.
      (3)   The applicant must possess all equipment necessary in the judgment
of the Administrator or his authorized representative, to adequately install
septic tanks and make connections to the public sewer system and to construct
the related sewer systems being connected to the public sewer.  Such equipment
shall be adequate capacity and maintained in proper working order so as to
provide adequate performance at all times.
      (4)   A sewer tapper’s license shall authorize the licensee to install
septic tanks or to tap, open and make connections with public sewers, drains
and drainage facilities under the provisions of the ordinances of the Village
and laws of the State, provided that such license shall not be issued nor
become effective until such applicant files with surety or sureties approved by
the Administrator in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) and containing
provisions that such licensee will indemnify and save harmless the Village from
all loss or damage that may be either directly or indirectly occasioned by his
opening, tapping or making connection with any public sewer or drain, or
drainage facility, failure to properly perform the work or any work incident
thereto.  Should the surety or sureties withdraw from the bond, or the bond for
any reason becomes of no effect, then the license issued to such applicant
shall immediately become void without notice.
      (5)   The licensee, in making excavations in any street, alley, easement,
public way or other public place shall in all respects be governed by the
provisions of law and the ordinances of the Village now in force or which may
be hereafter adopted, regulating excavations.  If the licensee violates any of
the ordinances of the Village or laws of the State relative to the excavating
of streets or other public places, or the opening, tapping and/or connection
with public sewers, drains and drainage facilities, the Administrator shall
have the power to suspend the license for such time as he may deem proper, or
revoke the same as he may deem appropriate in the public interest.
      (6)   By acceptance of a sewer tapper’s license, the applicant assumes
responsibility for restoring any pavement, curb, sidewalk, driveway, sewer pipe
or appurtenance, shrubbery, lawn or other facility in the public right- of-way
or established easement which is disturbed or damaged by the operation.
      (7)   The Administrator or his authorized representative shall have the
authority to require the applicant, before the work is started in a public
right-of-way or established easement, to have two (2) men on the job: one (1)
operator of trenching equipment and one (1) man as a pipe layer.
      (8)   Fraudulent statements or other misrepresentations made by the
applicant in his application for a license, or failure to show adequate
performance in installing septic tanks or in laying of a sewer line, or failure
to abide by any of the foregoing provisions, shall be grounds for the denial or
revocation of the license by the Administrator.
      (9)   No person, authorized and licensed under this chapter to install
septic tanks or to make openings, taps or connections with sewers, drains or
drainage facilities or provide septic tank cleaning or repair services, shall
allow his name to be used by another for the purpose of obtaining permits, or
of doing any work under the license issued to him.
   (f)   Substances Prohibited.  No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any of the following described waters or wastes to any public
sewers:
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid or gas.
      (2)   Any waters or wastes having a ph lower than (5.0), higher than
(10.5)  or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structure, equipment and personnel of the wastewater works.
      (3)   Solids or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interferences with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole animal blood, manure,
animal hair and fleshings, animal entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk
containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
   (g)   Substances Limited.   The following described substances, materials,
waters or waste shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property or
constitute a nuisance.  The Administrator may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if in his opinion such more
severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives.  Deliberate
dilution with unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in the
regulations below shall not be acceptable.  In forming his opinion as to the
acceptability, the Administrator will give consideration to such facts as the
quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process
employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of
the waste in the wastewater treatment plant and other pertinent factors.  The
limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or
wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without
approval of the Administrator are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150 degrees F.
   (2)   Wastewater containing more than 50 milligrams per liter of petroleum
oil, non-biodegradable cutting oils, product of mineral oil origin or floatable
oils, fat, wax or grease.
      (3)   Any waters or wastes containing solids, liquids or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes to
injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a public nuisance or create any hazard in the
receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant, including but not limited
to cyanides, hexavalent chromium, copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel, and phenols in
the wastes as discharged to the public sewer.  The following concentrations
shall not be exceeded in wastes discharged to the public sewers: 
 
total Cyanide (CN)       NONE PERMITTED
Hexavalent chromium     0.5  mg/1
Copper            0.2  mg/1

Phenols         0.2  mg/1
Lead            0.5  mg/1
Mercury         0.01 mg/1
Silver            0.2  mg/1
These maximum concentrations may be changed as necessary by the Administrator
or State regulatory agencies based on new information concerning inhibitory
substances or to protect treatment plant processes.  Industrial discharges
covered by Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet those limitations
specified under the effluent guidelines published under Title 40 CFR Part 403
of the Federal Act or the above concentrations whichever is more stringent. 
Major contributing industries discharging incompatible pollutants into the
public sewers shall be regulated as provided in subsection (h) hereof.
      (4)   Any waters of wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Administrator or any local or State
regulatory agencies.
      (5)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentrations as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations.
      (6)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a
“slug” as defined herein.
      (7)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment process employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (8)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer systems, release obnoxious gases, form suspended solids
which interfere with the collection system or create a condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes.
   (h)   Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges.
      (1)   If any water or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in subsection (g)(3) and (4), and which in the
judgment of the Administrator, may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, including
violation of applicable water quality standards, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Administrator may:
         A.   Reject the waste;
         B.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
         C.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         D.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treatment
of the wastes.
      (2)   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations
Part 128 unless the Village is committed, in its NPDES permit, to remove a
specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant.  In those instances the
applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels
determined by the Administrator, or his duly authorized representative, or
State regulatory agencies.
      (3)   If the Administrator requires pretreatment or equalization of waste
flow, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Administrator and State regulatory agencies
and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
      (4)   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at his expense.
      (5)   The Administrator reserves the right to prohibit future connections
to the sanitary sewer if sufficient capacity is not available at the wastewater
treatment facility, and if in his/her judgment exceeding the capacity would
have a deleterious effect on the treatment works and its ability to maintain
compliance with the NPDES permit.
   (i)   Control of Industrial Wastes.
      (1)   Within ninety (90) days after passage of this section, each person
whose operation entails the discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer
shall prepare and file with the Administrator a written statement setting forth
the nature of the operation contemplated or presently carried on, the amount
and source of water required for use, the proposed point of discharge of said
wastes into the wastewater collection system of the Village, the estimated
amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting forth expected
bacterial, physical, chemical and other known characteristics of said wastes. 
Within a reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the duty of
the Village to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the
judgment of the Administrator may be necessary to adequately guard against
unlawful uses of the Village’s wastewater system.
      (2)   When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist which would
create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with the time schedule
imposed herein a request for extension of time may be presented for
consideration of the Administrator.  All request for extension of time shall be
submitted in writing stating the reasons for such a request.  Under no
circumstances shall the extension of time exceed ninety (90) days after
approval of the extension by the Administrator.
      (3)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to possible payment
therefore by the industrial concern.  The industrial concern may appeal to the
Administrator any determination made in the enforcement of this section.
   (j)   Protection from Damage.  No unauthorized persons shall maliciously,
willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with
any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the waste treatment
works.
   (k)   Powers and Authority of Inspectors.
      (1)   Employees of the Village, duly authorized by the Administrator and
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling
and testing pertinent to discharge to the wastewater treatment works in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   The authorized employees of the Village are authorized to obtain
information concerning industrial or commercial process information which have
a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater
treatment works.  The owner may withhold process information considered
confidential.  The owner must establish that the revelation to the public of
the information in question might result in an advantage to competitors.
      (3)   The Administrator is hereby authorized to make and enforce such
regulations as may be necessary or proper in respect to or to provide for:
         A.   The safe, economical and efficient management and protection of
the public sanitary facilities and appurtenances;
         B.   The treatment, pumping and disposal of wastewater, wastes, storm,
waters and any pumping, transmission or facilities thereof;
         C.   The construction, repair, maintenance and use of the public sewer
system, facilities, appurtenances and connections thereto, including the
materials used in and methods employed in the performance of such work
pertaining thereto;
         D.   Such applications, permits, bonds and other forms or documents as
may be necessary or convenient to the discharge of his duties and
responsibilities in respect to and the enforcement of the provisions of this
Council pertaining to the subject matter hereof.
      (4)   Such rules and regulations when approved by Council shall be
enforced to the same extent as the provisions of this chapter or other
legislation enacted by Council and violations thereof shall be punished as
provided in Section
921.99.
   (i)   Normal Concentration of Wastes.  Charges for waste treatment pursuant
to subsection (p) hereof, shall apply to wastes not exceeding normal
concentrations as follows:
      For discharge to Conventional Gravity Sanitary Sewers
      (1)    BOD-250 milligrams per liter;
      (2)    Suspended Solids-300 milligrams per liter;
   Applicable concentrations shall be based upon average concentrations,
weighted in proportion to volume of flow and determined during each billing
period by the most practical method possible.  Should the average concentration
discharged to a Conventional Gravity Sanitary Sewer of any constituent exceed
the normal concentration provided in subsection (l)(1), a surcharge for each
constituent so exceeded shall apply for the applicable billing period, in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (q).
   (m)   Pollutants in Excess of Normal Concentrations.  Wastewater containing
pollutants in excess of normal concentrations as defined in subsection (l)(1)
shall be:
      (1)   Subject to prohibition of discharge to the wastewater treatment
works; or,
      (2)   Subject to pretreatment prior to discharge to the wastewater
treatment works to comply with concentrations or amounts of pollutants
established by the Village and subject to payment of a surcharge pursuant to
subsection (q); or
      (3)   Permitted to be discharged to the wastewater treatment works
without pretreatment, subject to payment of a surcharge pursuant to subsection
(q).
   The Village shall determine which of the three alternatives shall apply,
based upon the volume and concentration of pollutants of the wastewater
involved.
   (n)   Volume of Wastewater.
      (1)   As described in subsequent subsections of this section, certain
segments of the Sanitary Sewer Charges are determined by applying a unit charge
to a volume of wastewater flow from each user.  In all cases, this volume to be
charged for shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded
on the meters used to measure water from the water system of the Village,
unless the user is supplied with water from a source other than the water
system of the Village or unless a substantial volume of water supplied to the
user is not discharged to the wastewater treatment works, in which case, the
volume of water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be
determined by a meter installed to measure wastewater discharged, or by other
means approved by the Village.  In the event a sewer user shall elect at his
own cost and expense to install a meter to register the exact volume of
wastewater that enters the wastewater treatment works, the volume to be charged
for such metered shall be based upon one hundred percent (100%) of the actual
meter reading and the rates established by the Village shall apply.  Meters
installed other than the meter used to record consumption from the water system
of the Village shall be approved by the Village and installed and maintained at
the expense of the user.
      (2)   Wastewater meters may be tested by the Village for accuracy at the
expense of the owner once a year.
      (3)   The Village shall have the authority to remove the meter on its
initiative to undertake the test and correct any meter which in its judgment is
registering incorrectly without the consent of the owner.  Should the
wastewater meter be found to be registering outside of the accuracy of the
specifications published for such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for
shipping, testing, repair and replacement.  Should the wastewater meter be
found to be registering within the accuracy of the specifications published for
such meter, the Village shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and
replacement.  During the period the meter is not in service, the volume of
wastewater discharged shall be determined by the Administrator.
   (o)   User Class.
      (1)   For the purpose of applying User Charges and Extra Strength
Surcharges, all users of the wastewater treatment works shall be classified as
a member of one of the following two user classes and are subject to the above
charges.  No user will be excused from paying these charges.  No free service
is permitted:
         A.   Residential.     
         B.   Industrial.
      (2)   An industry may be placed in the Resident User Class if the
industry discharges primarily segregated sanitary wastes or primarily wastes
from sanitary conveniences.
      (3)   Any industry, institutional/governmental or commercial
establishment whose wastes are not primarily sanitary wastes or not primarily
wastes from sanitary conveniences shall be place in the Industrial User Class.
      (4)   The placement of a user within the Resident User Class shall be as
determined by the Administrator in accordance with the above criteria.
         (Ord. 1333.  Passed 11-14-89.)
   (p)   User Charges - Wastes of Normal Concentration.
      (1)   A User Charge shall be levied on all users of the wastewater
treatment works to provide funds necessary to pay for the costs of operation,
maintenance and replacement of the treatment works to each user, or user class,
in proportion to such users metered water loading of the treatment works. 
      (2)   Factors such as strength and delivery flow rate characteristics
shall not be considered and included as the basis for the user’s contribution. 
The method to be used to establish the User Charges for Waste within the limits
of normal concentrations (as defined in subsection (l) hereof) shall be defined
in this section. 
      (3)   The method to be used to establish the User Charge-Extra Strength
Surcharge for wastes in excess of normal concentrations shall be defined in
subsection (q) hereof.  (Ord. 1369.  Passed 4-13-93.) 
      (4)   The volume of wastewater from each user shall be subject to a User
Charge as follows:
         A.   Each consumer unit shall be billed monthly and shall be subject
to a Minimum Charge corresponding to a wastewater volume of 2,000 gallons.  The
minimum charge shall be thirty-one dollars and ninety-five cents ($31.95) per
month.
         B.   Each unit shall be billed for wastewater volumes in excess of
2,000 gallons per month.  An additional two dollars and thirty-three cents
($2.33) per each 1,000 gallons per month shall be charged.
         C.   A flat rate of thirty-seven dollars and eighty-six cents ($37.86)
per month shall be billed on each unmetered consumer unit.
         D.   In the event of a water meter serving more than one consumer,
each consumer unit shall be subject to a Minimum Charge and be allowed a
discharge of 2,000 gallons per consumer unit before additional volume charges
shall apply.
         E.   Charges as contained in this subsection shall be subject to
adjustment as necessary based upon annual audit of sewer revenue fund expenses.
         F.   On January 1, 2001 both the Minimum Charge and the excess rate
charge shall be increased by five percent (5%).
         G.   And a rate increase of five percent (5%) on January 1 of each
successive year until this section is amended or repealed.
            (Ord. 1522.  Passed 9-19-00.)
      (5)   That users residing outside of the Village Corporation Limits shall
be assessed an additional twenty percent (20%) surcharge of the current rate
for usage.
      (6)   Senior Citizen Discount: That a fifty percent (50%) discount will
be allowed to users sixty-two (62) years of age who can provide a Federal
Income Tax Return or other official document showing income of less than ten
thousand dollars ($10,000).
         (Ord. 1369.  Passed 4-13-93.)
      
   (q)   Extra Strength Surcharge.  In addition to the base User Charges
applicable pursuant to subsection (p) hereof users discharging pollutants to
the wastewater treatment works of the Village, whose average concentration, as
defined in subsection (l) in one or more classifications exceeds in any quarter
that concentration defined as normal in subsections (l)(1) in the corresponding
classification shall be subject to surcharges calculated as follows:
      (1)   Surcharges for each billing period during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following values for that calendar year:
         A.   Estimated total operation, maintenance and replacement expenses
C;
         B.   Estimated total pound of BOD received at the plant B;
         C.   Estimated total pounds of suspended solids received at the plant
S.
Data not available shall be estimated in the most practical manner possible and
shall be subject periodic but not less than an annual audit.
      (2)   Surcharge or User Charges per pound of BOD in excess of normal as
defined in subsection (l)(1) equals:
         C to X (0.24)
               Bt
      (3)   Surcharge on User Charges per pound of suspended solids in excess
of normal as defined in subsection (l)(1) equals:
         C to X (0.32)
St
      (4)   Pounds of BOD per billing period subject to surcharge equals:
(Average concentration of BOD, calculated pursuant to subsection (l) in
milligrams per liter minus 250 milligrams per liter) times the volume of
wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works per
billing period, in 1,000 gallons times 0.00834.  If the average concentration
of BOD is 250 milligrams per liter, or less, no surcharges for BOD shall apply.
      (5)   Pounds of Suspended Solids per billing period subject to surcharge
equals:
   (Average concentration of Suspended Solids, calculated pursuant to
subsection (l), in milligrams per liter minus 300 milligrams per liter) times
the volume of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment
works per billing period, in 1,000 gallons times 0.00834.  If the average
concentration of suspended solids is 300 milligrams per liter, or less, no
surcharge for suspended solids shall apply.
      (6)   Surcharge on User Charges equal pounds of BOD calculated pursuant
to subsection (q)(4) times surcharge per pound calculated pursuant to
subsection (q)(2); plus pounds of suspended solids calculated pursuant to
subsection (q)(5); times surcharge per pound calculated pursuant to subsection
(q)(3).
      (7)   Formulas as contained in subsections (q)(2), and (3), shall be
subject to adjustment as necessary based upon annual audit of sewer revenue
fund expenses.
   Surcharges may also be established for pollutants other than those provided
for in this paragraph which are permitted to be discharged to the wastewater
treatment works by the Village, after pretreatment, or without pretreatment.
   Surcharges levied pursuant to this subsection (q) shall be billed monthly or
as otherwise established by the Village.  The rates shall be as established by
the Village.
(Ord. 1333.  Passed 11-14-89.)
   (r)   Debt Service Charges. 
      (1)   A Debt Service Charge shall be levied on users of the wastewater
treatment works to provide funds necessary to meet the principal and interest
payments of the wastewater treatment plant construction cost. 
      (2)   The method to be used to establish the Debit Service Charges for
wastes discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be defined in this
subsection.
      (3)   The volume of wastewater from each user shall be subject to a Debt
Service Charge as follows:
         A.   Each consumer unit shall be billed monthly and shall be subject
to a Minimum Charge corresponding to a wastewater volume of 2,000 gallons.  The
minimum charge shall be $12.00 per month.
         B.   Each consumer unit shall be billed for wastewater volumes in
excess of 2,000 gallons per month.  An additional $0.75 per 1,000 gallons per
month shall be charged.
         C.   A flat rate of $15.79 per month shall be billed to each un-
metered consumer unit.
   Debt service charges pursuant to this section shall be billed pursuant to
subsection (t) hereof and shall be subject to a minimum charge corresponding to
a wastewater volume of 2,000 gallons.  The debt service charge shall expire at
the date when the last scheduled installment payment is made on the loan for
the wastewater treatment works, EPA Project No. 391544N010.  These funds shall
only be used to pay the debt service charge unless subsequently changed by
ordinance of Council. 
(Ord. 1369.  Passed 4-13-93.)
   (s)   Use of Funds.  The funds received from the collection of the charges
authorized by this section shall be deposited with the Fiscal Officer and shall
be known as the Sewer Revenue Fund and Sewer Replacement Fund.  When
appropriated by Council, the Sewer Revenue Fund shall be available for the
payment of costs and expenses of the management, maintenance and operation of
the Wastewater Treatment Works and the Replacement Fund shall be available for
replacement costs of the Wastewater Treatment Works.
   (t)   Billing and Collection.
      (1)   The billing and collection of Sanitary Sewer Charges is hereby
delegated to the Administrator, to be assessed, levied and collected monthly in
conjunction with the administration of the charges for water service supplied
by the Village.  The same shall be subject to and governed by the valid and
applicable rules and regulations from time to time established by the Village
with respect to the collection of water charges.  To insure that the revenue
collected is sufficient to support the system an annual audit, or more often if
required, will be made and the rates will be adjusted accordingly.
      (2)   At least once annually, the billing statement will show the
separate charges applied to debt service charges and user charges.  The
Sanitary Sewer Charges shall be a lien upon all real property owned by each
user and for certification of delinquent payments to the County Auditor for
special assessment upon the tax duplicate, in accordance with the Ohio Revised
Code.
      (3)   Any sanitary Sewer Charges which are certified delinquent to the
County Auditor shall be subject to a 10% surcharge.  Sanitary Sewer Charges
shall be considered delinquent if not paid within thirty days after due and
payable.
      (4)   The Administrator is hereby authorized to discontinue either the
delinquent consumer’s water service or sewer service, whichever is more
practicable and feasible to the Village at any time after due delinquency
notification to the consumer.  A delinquent account shall never be allowed to
continue after sixty (60) days from the original billing date.
      (5)   The owners of mobile home courts, apartment buildings and
commercial or industrial complexes shall furnish the Village with an accurate
and true list of consumer units occupying his or her lands or lands or
buildings unless the number of units increases or decreases which shall be
reported to the Village immediately or may be reported at set intervals as
agreed upon by the Administrator.
      (6)   In the event the consumer has utilized the sewer service less than
a full billing period and the water service has been curtailed by the Village
or proper notification has been given to the Village, the minimum charge may be
pro-rated at no less than a monthly basis provided the water consumption is
also less than the average of 6,750 gallons per month.

923.01  BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   (a)   Cross-Connection; General Policy.
      (1)   Purpose.  The purpose of these Rules and Regulations is:
         A.   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer’s water system contaminants or
pollutants which could back-flow through the service connection into the public
potable water system.
         B.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
         C.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer’s potable water systems.
      (2)   Application.  These Rules and Regulations shall apply to all
premises served by the public potable water system of the Village of Windham,
Ohio.
      (3)   Policy.  The Village Administrator shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water system from contamination due to back-
flow of contaminants through the water service connection.  If, in the judgment
of the Village Administrator, an approved back-flow prevention device is
necessary at the water system, the Village Administrator or his authorized
representative shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved back-
flow prevention device at each service connection to his premises.  The
consumer shall immediately install such approved device or devices at his own
expense, and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to
install such device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have
been installed.
 
   (b)   Definitions.  The following definitions shall apply in the
interpretation and enforcement of these rules and regulations:
      (1)   “Air gap separation” means the unobstructed vertical distance

(Ord. 1080.  Passed 6-9-76.)

   (a)     Ohio R.C. 743.04 will be strictly adhered to.
   (b)     All water rent payments are due in full on the 15th of each month.
   (c)     All unpaid balances outstanding after the 15th of the month shall

   (d)     A customer's water supply may be shut off from any premise for which
the water rent remains unpaid for a period of thirteen (13) days after payment
is due.
   (e)     A twenty-five dollar ($25.00) shut-off fee may be added to the
account of any customer whose service is shut off.  Once shut off, the
customer's service will only be turned back on except upon full payment of the
unpaid water bill, any and all penalties and shut-off fees, if those fees and
penalties are imposed in conformity with the regulations of the Village
Administrator.
   (f)   A twenty-five dollar ($25.00) turn-on fee may be added onto the bill
of any customer who requests that their service be reconnected, if such a fee
is imposed in conformity with the regulations of the Village Administrator.
   (g)   Any person requesting water and/or sewer service that has a prior
outstanding balance at any address within the Village shall be required to pay
the outstanding balance in full prior to again receiving water and sewer
service.
   (h)   No deposit requirement for water services shall be required unless a
customer becomes delinquent.  In that case the Village Administrator
regulations may require up to a one hundred dollar ($100.00) deposit plus
payment for all prior services and costs associated with the shut-off prior to
service being restored.  (Ord. 2015-2.  Passed 3-24-15.)
   (i)   In the case of leased lots, parcels of land or premises enjoying
connection to the Village water system or the Village wastewater system, the
landowner shall be liable for the payment of the water and wastewater service
charges herein provided, including all services provided to tenants residing at
the premises. The obligation of the landowner as set forth in this section
shall not be assigned to another, and a condition of receiving water or
wastewater service from the Village is that the landowner shall be solely
responsible to the Village for water and wastewater charges for service
provided to the landowners property.  This section is intended to establish the
obligation of the landowner to the Village only, and expressly does not address
in any fashion the conditions under which a landowner may permit another to use
the landowner's property.  In the event a landowner currently has a leased
premises pursuant to a written contract under which a tenant is obligated to
pay water and/or sewer rents, the landowner may defer the date of imposition of
the requirements set forth above by following the procedure set forth below:
      (1)   The landowner must provide a copy of the entire written lease
agreement to the Village Administrator.
      (2)   The Village Administrator will review the lease to determine if the
tenant is obligated to pay water and sewer rents.
      (3)   If the tenant is obligated to pay water and sewer rents under the
written lease, the Village Administrator may defer the enforcement of the
exclusive landowner obligations in this section against the landowner until the
end of the term of the provided lease or for one year, whichever ends first. 
An extension of a lease granted after submition of a lease to the Village
Administrator shall not qualify for additional deferral. 
      (4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of the deferral of enforcement, in
the event the water and sewer rents are not paid, the landowner remains jointly
and severally liable with the tenant to the Village for water and sewer service
provided to the landowner's property.
      (5)   The Village Administrator is not under an affirmative obligation to
inform landlords of the deferral of compliance under this section.
         (Ord. 2020-6.  Passed 4-28-20.)
   (j)     In the event service department employees are called to an address
served by the Village water system or sanitary sewer system, and are requested
by the landowner or other individual with apparent authority to do so, to enter
the structure and shut off an internal main valve or other source of water
flowing within the building, a shutoff fee in the amount of fifty dollars
($50.00) may be charged.  The regulations of the Village Administrator shall
govern when this fee will be imposed.  This charge shall be in addition to any
other charge for the account involved at the service address involved.  This
subsection (j) is expressly subject to subsection (a) hereof in that the
collection process set forth in Ohio R.C. 743.04 applies to the shut off fee
established herein; and the fee is also subject to subsection (i) in that the
charges for the services provided are the responsibility of the owner of the
structure and in the event of a rental property, from either the Lessor or the
Lessee. (Ord. 2015-2.  Passed 3-24-15.)
927.05  WATER METER REPLACEMENT FEE.
   A water meter replacement fee in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) per
account, per month, is hereby established.  This fee shall be placed in the
appropriate fund established by the Village Council and designated for the sole
purpose of replacing water meters and associated equipment (including computers
and the associated software) as the meters wear out, fail, or are otherwise in
need of replacement.  This fee shall begin to be imposed on the 1st day of
August, 2012.  From that date forward, no water meter utility customer shall be
charged any amount in addition to the fee established in this section for the
replacement of a water meter on the premises serviced by the account in
question, as long as all payments on that account are current. 
(Ord. 2015-6.  Passed 7-28-15.)
927.06  REPAIRING AND/OR REPLACING WATER METERS.
   (a)   Upon the determination of the Village Administrator that a meter is
either mis- functioning  or non-functioning, a ten (10) day written notice
shall be given the water customer to contact the Village Utility Department to
have the meter checked to be repaired or replaced.  This notice may be mailed
or left at the unit in question.
   (b)   In the event the water customer fails to contact the Village Utility
Department within the ten (10) day period, a second written notice shall be
either sent certified or personal delivery indicating that the water shall be
turned off after ten (10) days of the receipt of the second notice and shall
not be restored until the meter has been repaired and/or replaced and all fees
relating to the shut-off have been paid.
(Ord. 0-2005-10.  Passed 5-10-05.)
927.07  INTERFERENCE WITH METERS PROHIBITED.
   (a)   No person, without consent of the Village, shall interfere, tamper
with, disconnect, change, alter or by-pass any meter, or the pipes running into
the meter, used for measuring the consumption of water provided to any consumer
by the Village.
   (b)   No person shall procure, aid, abet or conspire with any person to do
any of the acts in Section
927.07(a).
   (c)   The Village Utility Department or their agents, are hereby authorized
to disconnect the water service of any consumer who he has probable cause to
believe has violated any provision of subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)   In addition to paying the costs of repairing and reconnecting the
water meter or pipes running to the meter, whoever violates any of the
provision of this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor offense. 
The first such offense shall be punished by a fine of up to a maximum of one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  A second offense within one calendar year of
the initial offense shall be punished by a file of up to a maximum of two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).  Any third or subsequent offense within one
calendar year shall be punished by a fine of up to five hundred dollars
($500.00).  Each day such violation exists beyond the period stipulated in the
Notice, shall constitute a violation.
(Ord. 2020-19.  Passed 10-27-20.)
927.99  PENALTY.
   Any customers failing to comply with the regulations set forth in this
Chapter shall be assessed a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month
for so long as the noncompliance exists, as well as all additional charges
which are reasonably related to the enforcement of this chapter.  All funds
received from this penalty provision shall be used for the payment of the costs
and expense of operation, maintenance, repair and management of the Utility.

(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1111.03  DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Arrangement.  The arrangement, character, extent, width and location
of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan.  The design
of proposed streets shall provide for both the continuation of existing streets
and access to adjacent unplatted lands so that the entire area can be served
with a coordinated street system.
   (b)   Street Classifications.
      (1)   Major arterial thoroughfares shall be planned for continuation of
movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic generation and from
one section of the community to another.  They shall contain as few
intersections with local streets as possible and shall minimize or prohibit
direct access from adjacent properties.  Such thoroughfares shall traverse the
community and shall be spaced approximately one mile apart.
      (2)   Collector streets shall provide a traffic route from local streets
to major arterial thoroughfares.  These streets shall be spaced approximately
one- fourth mile apart.
      (3)   Local streets shall provide direct and full access to each lot and
shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
The street system shall be so designed that all proposed streets shall be in
general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the
entire neighborhood.  The streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the
tract to be recorded unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the development of adjacent
tracts.  Dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall be approved only when
necessitated by topography or other physical conditions or where, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, they are appropriate for the type of
development contemplated.
      (4)   Parallel streets may be required along an existing or proposed
major arterial thoroughfare to provide access to lots along such thoroughfares.
   (c)   Street Right-of-Way Widths and Grades.
 
               Minimum         Grades
               Right-of-Way         by Percent
Classification            Width in Feet      Maximum   Minimum
Major arterial thoroughfare            80            5            *
Collector, commercial and
    industrial streets               80            8            *
Local streets
    Urban single-family      60 with curbs            8            *
    Urban multi-family      60 with curbs            8            *
    Light industrial         60 without curbs         8            *
Parallel streets            40 with curbs            8            *
*Minimum grade should be adequately constructed to accommodate proper drainage
according to drainage system requirements as provided in Section
1111.04.
   (d)   Half Streets.  Half streets shall be prohibited except where there is
an existing half street adjacent to the subdivision in which case the remaining
half of the street shall be platted.
   (e)    Cul-de-Sacs and Dead-End Streets.  Streets designed to be a permanent
cul-de-sac shall  not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the
closed end with a turn-around having an outside pavement diameter of at least
seventy-five feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet.  If
such a street is of a temporary nature and a further extension into adjacent
land is anticipated, then the turning circle beyond the normal street width
shall be in the nature of an easement over the premises included in the turning
circle, but beyond the boundaries of the street proper.  Such easements shall
be automatically vacated to abutting property owners when the dead-end street
legally extends into adjacent land.  If such dead-end street extends only one
lot depth past a street intersection, no turn-around shall be required.  The
sub-divider shall be required to reserve to the Village a strip of land two
feet in width at the end of all dead-end streets.  This strip will become a
dedicated highway only upon extension of a dedicated street.  The developer
will be required to rough grade all stub streets not required to be
constructed.
   (f)   Corner Radii.  Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded
with a radius of not less than thirty feet for major arterial thoroughfares,
collector and industrial streets, and twenty feet for local streets.  Chords or
cut-offs may be permitted in place of rounded corners.
   (g)   Horizontal and Vertical Curves.  Angles in the alignment of street
lines shall be connected by a curve with a radius on the center line of not
less than 150 feet for local streets, 300 feet for collector and industrial
streets and 500 feet for major arterial thoroughfares.  Between reverse curves
there shall be a tangent at least 100 feet long on major arterial
thoroughfares.  Every change in street grade shall be made with a vertical
curve to provide sight distance suited to the location which in no case shall
be less than 300 sight feet from a height of four and one-half feet.
   (h)   Intersections.  Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an
angle of less than sixty degrees.  Multiple intersections involving junctions
of more than two streets shall be prohibited.
   (i)    Street Jogs.  Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 160
feet shall be prohibited.  If deemed necessary by the Planning Commission, the
minimum distance between center line offsets may be increased or adjusted. 
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1111.04  DRAINAGE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    The design criteria for the drainage systems shall be based on the
State of Ohio Department of Transportation Design Policy and the drainage
requirements (#1 through #8) of the 1963 Portage County Subdivision
Regulations, with the exception being a minimum easement width of twenty feet.
   (b)    These criteria shall apply to development along existing roads as
well as those requiring new roads to be constructed.
      (1)    Road drainage system.  The road storm drainage system shall serve
as the local drainage system.  It shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent
land, and house storm water drainage.  To prevent excessive pipe sizes, storm
sewers shall drain into natural waterways where possible.
      (2)    Off-road drainage system.  The design of the off-road drainage
system shall include the watershed affecting the allotment and shall be
extended to a watercourse or ditch adequate to receive the storm drainage.
         (Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1111.05  STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall design and construct pavements, curbs and gutters of
sizes and types not less than as provided for in the table set forth herein for
all streets.  Pavement cross-sections shall be as specified by the current
edition of the State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and
Material Specifications.
   (a)     Methods of constructions and materials shall meet the requirements
of the current State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and
Materials specifications unless otherwise ordered by the Village Inspector.
   (b)     Subgrades shall be inspected and approved by the Village Inspector
before any materials are placed.  Each material course shall be accepted by the
Village Inspector before each succeeding courts is constructed.
   (c)   The type and quantities of materials to be used will be determined by
the Village Inspector.  Quality tests and analysis shall be required by the
Village Inspector.  Where 404 is laid on 301 base immediately, prime or tack
coat will be required.
   (d)     Except where 451 and 452 pavement is used, all curbing shall be 24
inches wide combination curb and gutter sections, constructed of Portland
cement concrete.
         Minimum gutter thickness shall be 8 inches.
Residential curb shall be mountable concrete type, 4 inches higher than the
gutter. 
Curbing on collector and industrial streets shall be mountable concrete type, 6
inches higher than the gutter.  Curb openings for drive, ditches, drains, etc.,
are not permitted.
   (e)     Surface width is area between gutters.  Total width is face-to-face
curbing distances.
      NOTE:
      The basis for the design of pavements is made on the chart as follows:
 
ITEM      STRUCTURAL NUMBER
404         0.35
402         0.35
301          0.35
304          0.14
   The use of a combination of any of these materials that equal or exceed the
structural equivalences listed is permissible.  In all cases, the surface
course may not be substituted, but all substitutions for those listed shall be
approved by the Village Inspector.
   In lieu of the above, design of pavement may be determined as outlined in
the current Ohio Department of Transportation design policy memorandum
entitled: “Current Pavement Design Manual-Secondary and Local Roads and
Streets.”
      (1)   Pavements.  Higher standards and/or greater widths than indicated
herein may be required by the Planning Commission and/or the Village Inspector
to adequately provide for unusual soil conditions or extraordinary traffic
volumes or loads.  After the underground utilities and house connections are
installed and rough grading completed, the roadway subgrade shall be shaped,
rolled and compacted.  (Refer to Table I and Appendix A.)  The subdivider may
construct a temporary roadway of slag or stone for use during the building
construction period.  Such pavements shall be maintained in a safe and passable
condition by the subdivider without expense to the Village.
      (2)     Curbs and Gutters.  Concrete curbs and gutters, separate and
integral with pavement, shall be provided as indicated in Table I and as
indicated by the typical cross section shown in Appendix A.  Where curbs exist,
downspout and footer drains must be connected to the storm sewer; drains
through the curb will not be permitted.
   (3)    Sidewalks.  Sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement
concrete four inches thick with the thickness increased to six inches where the
sidewalk is crossed by a driveway.  They shall be located as shown by the
typical cross section in Appendix A.  The construction and materials shall be
as specified in the State of Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and
Materials Specifications.  Sidewalk widths shall be a minimum of four feet. 
The Planning Commission may allow pedestrian walkways to be substituted for
sidewalks.
         New sidewalks are the responsibility of the property owner and must be
completed no more than 30 days after completion of building a new home/duplex/
apartment building, etc.  Maintenance of all sidewalks is the responsibility of
the landowner.
      (4)   Pedestrian Walkways.  Pedestrian walkways, not less than ten feet
wide, or of such greater width as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission,
shall be required across blocks where the Planning Commission deems that
pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and
other community facilities is necessary.  Paving, fencing and other required
improvements shall be determined by the Planning Commission, as recommended by
the Village Inspector.
      (5)    Street Name Signs.  To avoid duplication and confusion, the
proposed names of all streets shall be approved by the Village Planning
Commission prior to such names being assigned or used.  The subdivider shall
install a street sign showing the names of all streets at all street
intersections.  The signs shall conform to the specifications of the Village
Planning Commission and be mounted at a height of approximately seven feet
above the top of the curb or crown of the pavement.  The sign shall be located
as directed by the Village Planning Commission.
      (6)   Street Lights.  The subdivider shall install street lights in
accordance with the standards and specifications of the Village.
         (Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1111.06  MAINTENANCE BOND.
   (a)    The maintenance bond period for all work performed shall begin with
the date of acceptance for maintenance and shall extend for a period of one
year.  Acceptance for maintenance is contingent upon completion of required
repairs as prescribed by the Village Inspector.  At any time during the bond
period, the Village may notify the subdivider and his surety that certain
repairs are necessary.  Within sixty days, weather permitting, after being so
notified, the subdivider shall make such repairs as are declared necessary to
restore the work to a good and serviceable condition.  In the event that the
subdivider fails to comply with the order to repair as provided, the repairs
shall be made by the Village and the subdivider shall agree to reimburse the
Village for the expenses so incurred within ten days following the receipt of a
statement rendered to the subdivider by the Village for such expense.
   (b)    The subdivider shall also make repairs due to erosion or abuse by
utility companies and shall repair all failures for all other reasons during
the maintenance bond period.  The streets and other improvements shall be in
condition acceptable to the Village at the end of the maintenance period.  If
the subdivider fails to perform such maintenance to the complete satisfaction
of Council, Council may use such bond to make the necessary repairs at its
discretion.
   (c)    If the cost of providing security to the Village for the one year
period is prohibitive, the subdivder may, with approval of Council, make an
assignment of bonds or other form of acceptable improvement cost for the first
year.
   (d)    After one year, the subdivider is required to apply for final
acceptance by the Village Council prior to submitting for Village dedication.
   (e)    A temporary public turn-around shall be provided and maintained on
all uncompleted roads accepted for maintenance.

1115.01  SUBMISSION OF PLANS.
   (a)    Prior to the start of any construction, including any houses or
streets, the developer shall furnish a plot plan showing the slab or floor
elevation of each house proposed to be constructed.  He shall also show by the
use of arrows, how he proposes to drain each lot.  In lieu of a plat plan, this
information may be shown on the street plan and profile sheets.  All house eave
spouts shall be connected with tile to a storm sewer house connection.
   (b)    The developer shall submit on contour maps, or other suitable maps,
information relative to the area to be drained, and submit necessary
calculations prepared by his registered engineer in determining the proposed
water collection system.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1115.02  DESIGN STANDARDS.
      (a)    The design criteria will be based upon information obtained from
the “Ohio State Highway Department Manual of Location and Design”.
   (b)    Run-off or design discharge for sewer design, where the contributing
area generally consists of pavement and a narrow strip back of the pavement,
shall be obtained from the rational formula:    Q = CiA.
   (c)    Peak rates of run-off watersheds under 1,000 acres shall be obtained
from the following formula:
Q=   RF x CF x Ff x Q.
   (d)    The following design frequencies are to be used:
 
Roadway ditches        2 years
Storm sewers           5 years
Culvert under roadways   25 years
Water courses       10 years.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1115.03  DITCH PROTECTION.
   (a)    The developer shall adequately protect all roadway ditches and open
watercourses to the satisfaction of the Village Inspector by one of the
following methods.
   (b)    Ditch protection in the form of L-9 seeding and L-10 sodding, S.H.D.
specifications shall be provided.  The following shall be the allowable ditch
velocities for L-9 seeding and L-10 sodding on various soil types.
 
Soil Type      L-9 Allowable Velocity fps    L-10 Allowable Velocity fps
Fine sand            2            5                 
Silt loam            2            5                 
Ordinary firm loam         2.5            5                 
Stiff clay            3            6                 
Graded silt to cobbles       4            6                 
Weathering shales         5             -                 
Coarse gravel            6            7
   (c)    When the outlet velocity of storm sewers, culvert pipes, drive pipes
or side drains is in excess of the above allowable velocities, sufficient
length of I-14 paved gutter shall be provided for transition to allowable
velocity.
   
   (d)    In all cases, any drainage facility within the subdivision shall be
in a stable condition, free from either erosion of sedimentation at the time of
final approval.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1115.04  PAVED GUTTERS.
   (a)    Item I-14, S.H.D. specifications, shall consist of the construction
of a brick, concrete, approved broken concrete, or stone paved gutter and shall
be used in all drainage ditches where the grade exceeds two and one-half
percent (2-1/2%).
Alternate 1.   A storm sewer meeting the approval of the Village Inspector may
be constructed by the developer in lieu of the paved gutter.
Alternate 2.   In lieu of the above, ditch protection in the form of L-
9 seeding and L-10 sodding as described in Section
1115.03 may be provided.
   (b)    The Planning Commission will not approve any subdivision located in
areas subject to periodic flooding, unless the developer or subdivider agrees
to perform adequate improvements as will render the area safe from flooding. 
An additional bond in the amount deemed necessary by the Village Inspector must
be provided by the developer or subdivider to guarantee that he will comply
with the demands set forth in subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1115.05  EASEMENTS.
   (a)    Easements for drainage purpose shall be a minimum of twenty feet in
width.  Where the watercourse is large, easement widths shall be increased as
determined by the Village Engineer.  (See Section
1115.06(d).)  Where watercourses cross plotted lots diagonally, the developer
shall straighten such courses, where practicable, and shall substantially
follow sublot lines.  Easements shall be shown on the record plat and deeds,
and shall cover such existing or reconstructed watercourses.
   (b)    Additional easement requirements are as follows:
      (1)    Easements for drainage purposes shall be constructed or defined on
the ground by the developer before construction is started.
      (2)    In instances where the existing watercourse is well defined from
past storm drainage and where the developer is required to reconstruct the
watercourse along sublot lines, such reconstruction shall be completed to the
satisfaction of the Village Inspector.
      (3)    No open ditch shall be constructed within 150 feet of the rear or
side of a house, as measured from the house to the edge of the ditch easement.
         (Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1115.06  STANDARDS OF OPERATION.
   (a)    The road storm sewer system shall serve as the prime drainage
system.  It shall be designed to carry roadway, adjacent land and house storm
water drainage.  The design discharge used to determine pavement inlet spacing
shall be based on the Rational Method as mentioned above.  The gutter flow
between inlets shall be analyzed by the equation: Q-.56 Z/NS ½ Y8/3.
   (b)    The inlet spacing shall be based on a ten-year frequency, fifteen-
minute duration design storm.  The spread of water on the pavement shall be
limited to two feet into the traveled lane.  In addition to the above, storm
sewers shall contain inlets, catch basins or manholes at intervals of not over
300 feet.
   (c)    When the drainage system is outside of the road right of way, the
developer shall petition the Planning Commission to set up a Village-
established ditch to provide for the future maintenance of the system by
assessment of the benefitted owners within the subdivision.  This system shall
be so designed to incorporate only the watershed affecting the allotment and to
an adequate outlet.
   (d)    All waterways with a design capacity not exceeding the capacity of a
thirty-six inch concrete pipe shall be enclosed.  Existing creeks or ditches
constructed by the developer which exceed the above limit, shall be constructed
with a minimum of ten-foot wide continuous earth roadway which is to provide
access for maintenance equipment to all sections of the ditch.  The ditch
easement shall be wide enough to contain such ditch slopes and roadway with
ample clearance for the operation of maintenance equipment.  Open ditches shall
have 2:1 side slopes and a minimum two-foot bottom width.
   (e)    Any storm drainage courses carried along side lot lines shall be
enclosed with approved pipe.
   (f)    The following pipe policy will be worked together with the S.H.D.
specifications:
      (1)    It is intended that all pipe lines including culverts, storm
sewers, etc., located beneath the main roadways (within shoulder limits), shall
meet the requirements set forth for Class A pipe.
      (2)    Longitudinal storm sewer lines, not under the main roadways, shall
be identified as Class D or Class E.  Where these sewers require stronger pipe
by reason of shallow cover or location beneath side roads or drives, Class B or
Class C pipe shall be specified.
      (3)    Longitudinal roadway drainage lines, for which sealed joints are
unnecessary or undesirable, shall be identified as Class H pipes.  Portions of
these drains that require stronger pipe by reason of shallow cover, or location
beneath side roads or drives, shall be specified as Class C pipe.
      (4)    Open-end driveway pipe, twenty-four inches or less in diameter,
may be Class F pipe and those over twenty-four inches will be Class B or Class
C pipe.
      (5)    Outlet pipe for open-joint drains (Class H or I) shall be in
accordance with the provisions of Class F pipe and will usually be ten feet in
length.
      (6)    For pipe underdrains, the designer shall specify Class I pipe.
      (7)    Pipe arches or elliptical pipes will be designated as Class G. 
(g)    The pipe policy set forth in subsection (f) hereof and the pipe policy
used by the
Ohio State Highway Department shall be used in designing storm sewer systems.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1115.07  EROSION CONTROL.
   Whenever the topographic or surface features of a site are being altered,
and it is deemed necessary by the Zoning and Planning Commission, a plan
showing provisions for control of erosion and sedimentation during and after
the development, construction, extraction, or other use of the site shall be
prepared.  Such plan shall show proposals for restoration, rehabilitation, and
reclamation where necessary and shall be accompanied by documentation
indicating the review and recommendation on said plan by the Portage County
Soil and Water Conservation District, the Division of Lands and Soil of the
Department of Natural Resources, or other competent agency or soils scientist.
   Effective erosion and sediment controls shall be planned and applied
according to the following principles:
   (a)    The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time
during development, construction, extraction, or other use.
   (b)    When land is exposed during development, use, extraction, etc., the
exposure should be kept to the shortest practical period of time.
   (c)    Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development, use, etc.
   (d)    Sediment basins (debris basings, desilting basins, or silt traps)
shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from
land undergoing development, use, etc.
   (e)    Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
run-off caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development, use, etc.
   (f)    The permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as
soon as practical in the development, use, restoration, rehabilitation, etc.
   (g)    The development, extraction or use plan shall be fitted to the
topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
   (h)    Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected.

(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1143.02  ORGANIZATION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consist of three members appointed by the
Mayor and approved by Council.  Each member shall be appointed for one year and
one of the initial members shall be appointed for two years.  In the event of

shall make the appointment for the duration of the unexpired portion of the
term of the member.  The members of the Board shall be residents of the Village
and shall serve without compensation.  One member shall be a member of the
Planning Commission, to serve until the expiration of his Planning Commission
appointment, but not to exceed three years.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
elect a chairman from its membership, shall appoint a secretary, and shall
prescribe rules for the conduct of its affairs.  The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall require a quorum of two members at all its meetings and the concurring
vote of two members shall be necessary to effect any order.  The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall meet at the call of its chairman or two other members and
at such other regular times as it may by resolution determine.  All meetings of
the Board shall be public.  The Board of Zoning Appeals chairman or acting
chairman may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses in all

(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1143.03  APPEALS.
   (a)    Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person,
firm or corporation, or by any officer, board or department of the Village,
deeming himself or itself to be adversely affected by the decision of the
Zoning Ordinance.  Appeals shall be made no later than fifteen calendar days
after the date of the grievance.
 
   (b)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the administrative officer whose decision is appealed
from shall certify to the Board, after the notice of appeal has been filed,
that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order granted by the Board or
by a court having lawful jurisdiction.
 
   (c)    No fee shall be charged for an appeal from the decision or action of
the Zoning Inspector or Planning Commission on questions of interpretation or
enforcement of the sections of the Zoning Ordinance.  However, if the applicant
seeks a variance, a fee of (see fees schedule) shall be charged to cover the
expenses and costs of examining the requests for a variance.  Such a fee shall
not be refundable. 
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1143.04  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and determine all appeals from
any decision or action of the Zoning Inspector in the administration or
enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.  The Board shall hear and determine all
appeals from the refusal of the Zoning Inspector or Planning Commission,
because of anything contained in the Zoning Ordinance, to issue zoning
certificates or conditional zoning certificates, and the Board shall have the
power as limited herein to direct the issuance of a zoning certificate or
conditional zoning certificate.  The Board of Zoning Appeals, as herein
created, is a body of limited powers as specifically set forth in this section:
      (1)    Interpretation.  Upon appeal from a decision by an administrative
official, the Board shall have the power to decide any question involving the
interpretation of any provision of the Zoning Ordinance, including
determination of the exact location of any district boundary if there is
uncertainty with respect thereto.
      (2)    Variances.  The Board shall have the power to vary or adapt the
strict application of any of the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance in the
case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application would result
in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship that would deprive the owner of
the reasonable use of the land or buildings involved, but in no other case.
   (b)   No variance in the strict application of any provision of the Zoning
Ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it finds:
      (1)    That there are special circumstances or conditions fully described
in the findings, applying to the land or building for which the variance is
sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or building
and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood, and that
the circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of such land or building;
      (2)    That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of
the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and
that the variance as granted by the Board is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose; and
      (3)    That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance, and will not be injurious
to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   (c)    In granting any variance, the Board of Appeals shall prescribe any
conditions that it deems to be necessary or desirable.
   (d)    The Board has no authority to authorize a change of any parcel of
land from one zoning use district to another zoning use district nor has the
Board any authority to allow the construction of uses in any district which
uses are not among the list of permitted or conditionally permitted uses for
that district, nor has the Board any original jurisdiction to grant conditional
zoning certificates. 
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1143.05  PROCEDURE.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall act in strict accordance with the
procedures specified by law, including the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of
each member upon every question, or if absent or failing to vote, it shall
indicate such fact.
   (c)    All appeals and applications made to the Board shall be in writing
and on the forms prescribed therefor.  Every appeal or application shall refer
to the specified provision of the Zoning Ordinance involved, and shall exactly
set forth the interpretation that is claimed, the use for which the certificate
or conditional certificate is sought or the details of the variance that is
applied for and the grounds on which it is claimed that the variance should be
granted, as the case may be.
   (d)    Every decision of the Board shall be by resolution, each of which
shall contain a full record of the findings of the Board in the particular
case.  Each such resolution shall be filed in the office of the Fiscal Officer
by case number under one or another of the following headings: interpretation;
certificate; conditional certificate or variances, together with all documents
pertaining thereto.  The Board shall notify Council of each special permit and
each variance granted under the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and such
notice shall be in writing and filed with the Fiscal Officer within three days
of the action taken by such Board.  In the event that the Board finds it
necessary to draw upon any planning, legal, engineering or any other expert
testimony, the Board shall charge a reasonable fee in order to cover all
expenses of such expert testimony. 
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1143.06  NOTICE OF HEARINGS.   
   When a notice of appeal or variance has been filed in proper form with the
Board of Zoning Appeals, the secretary shall immediately place the request for
appeal or variance upon the calendar for hearing, with such hearing to be held
not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days from the date the
application was filed with the Board.  The secretary shall cause notices
stating the time, place and object of the hearing to be served personally or by
mail addressed to the parties making the request for appeal, at least five days
prior to the date of the scheduled hearing.  All notices shall be sent to
addresses given on the application.  Such hearings shall be advertised by
publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Village before the date of such hearing.  The Board at its
discretion, may send out further notices to publicize such hearings.  The Board
may recess such hearings from time to time and, if the time and place of the
continued hearing is publicly announced at the time of adjournment, no further
notice shall be required.

   (a)    Council may from time to time on its own motion, or on petition, or
on recommendation of the Planning Commission, amend by ordinance the number,
shape or area of districts established on the zoning districts map of the
regulations set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.  Every such proposed amendment

not constitute unreasonable zoning.
   (b)    Evidence that the proposed amendment would materialize in an equal or
better Zoning Ordinance than that existing.

1149.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)    Rather than assigning all uses to special individual and limited
zoning districts, it is important to provide reasonable flexibility in
requirements for certain kinds of uses that will allow practicable latitude for
the investor but that will at the same time maintain adequate security of the
health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community’s
inhabitants.  In order to accomplish such a dual objective, provision is made
in the Zoning Ordinance for a more detailed consideration of each of certain
specified activities as may relate to proposed conditions of location, design,
size, operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic and traffic movement,
concentration of population, etc.
 
   (b)    Land and structure uses possessing characteristics requiring special
controls are designated as conditionally permitted uses and are permitted
through the issuance of a conditional zoning certificate with such conditions
and safeguards attached as may be deemed necessary for the protection of the
public interests.
 
   (c)    The Planning Commission may authorize the issuance of such
conditional zoning certificates for any of the following uses in those
districts designated and the following procedures should be followed in
submitting a request for such a certificate.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1149.02  PROCEDURES FOR MAKING APPLICATION.
   (a)   Submission.  Any application shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission on a special form for that purpose; each application shall be
accompanied by the fee as indicated in Section
1139.03 (a).
 
   (b)    Data Required with Application.
            (1)   Special form supplied by Zoning Inspector, completed by
applicant. 
          (2)    Site plan, plot plan or development plan of the entire
property being considered, drawn to a reasonable scale and showing the location
of all abutting streets, and proposed structures, the type of buildings and
their uses.
          (3)    Complete plans and specifications for all proposed development
and construction.
          (4)    A statement supported by substantiating evidence regarding the
requirements enumerated in Section
1149.03 through
1149.05, inclusive.
 
   (c)   Review by Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall review
the proposed development as presented on the submitted plans and specification
in terms of the standards established in the Zoning Ordinance.  Such review
shall be completed and made public within sixty-five days from the time of
submission.
 
   (d)    Hearing.  After adequate review and study of any application, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing or hearings upon every
application after at least one publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Village at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing;
such notice shall indicate the place, time and subject of the hearing.
 
   (e)    Issuance and Revocation of Conditional Zoning Certificate.  Only upon
conclusion of hearing procedures relative to a particular application, may the
Planning Commission issue a conditional zoning certificate.  The breach of any
condition, safeguard or requirement shall automatically invalidate the
certificate granted, and shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance. 
Such violation shall be punishable as per Section
1139.04 ,
1139.05 , and
1139.99 .
 
   (f)    Reapplication.  No application for a conditional zoning certificate
which has been denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission shall be
resubmitted until the expiration of one year or more after such denial, unless
there is newly discovered evidence or proof of changed conditions which would
be sufficient to justify reconsideration by the Planning Commission.
 
   (g)    Continuation of Existing Uses Conditionally Permissible.  All uses
existing at the time of passage of the Zoning Ordinance and conditionally
permissible in their respective districts under the Zoning Ordinance shall be
issued conditional zoning certificates by the Planning Commission within one
year after the passage of the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1149.03  BASIS OF DETERMINATION.
   The Planning Commission shall establish that general standards and the
specific standards pertinent to each use indicated herein shall be satisfied by
the completion and operation of the proposed development.  The Planning
Commission may also impose such additional conditions and safeguards deemed
necessary for the general welfare, for the protection of individual property
rights, and for insuring that the intent and objectives of the Zoning Ordinance
will be observed. 
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1149.04  GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL CONDITIONAL ZONING CERTIFICATES.
   The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances
of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and shall find
adequate evidence showing that such use on the proposed location:
   (a)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general objectives,
or with any specific objective of the Village comprehensive zoning plan of
current adoption;
   (b)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended

1183.01  PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to recognize and accommodate in a unified
development, creative and imaginative planned residential development and to
permit those innovations in the technology of land development that are in the
best interests of the Village.  In order to accomplish this purpose, it is the
intention in establishing these conditions:
   (a)   To permit, in a planned unit development, a variety of dwelling types
including single-family and multifamily dwellings of the garden apartment,
townhouse and high-rise types, and at a maximum density compatible with the
purpose of the district within which the planned residential development is
proposed;
   (b)   To permit the flexible spacing of lots and buildings in order to
encourage:
      (1)   The separation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation;
      (2)   The conservation of the natural amenities of the landscape
      (3)   The provision of readily accessible recreation areas and green
spaces;
      (4)   The creation of functional and interesting residential areas; and
      (5)   The provision of a necessary complement of community facilities
such as central sanitary sewer and central water supply systems;
   (c)   To permit suitable associated commercial development consistent with
the demand created by the planned unit development and compatible with the
existing and proposed uses of lands adjacent to the planned unit development. 
The district density regulations of that district in which eighty percent (80%)
of the land lies shall apply to the entire planned unit development.  If no
district contains at least eighty percent (80%) of the project, the density
regulations of any district covering part of a planned unit development shall
apply to that part.
      (Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1183.02  USE REGULATIONS.
   A building or premises within a planned unit development shall be used for
the following purposes:
   (a)   Single-family detached residential dwellings.
     (b)   Single-family attached residential dwellings, but not to exceed the
percentage of the total number of dwelling units in the planned unit
development described for the zoning district in which the project is located;
see table.
   (c)   Multifamily dwellings which may exceed the height limitations of the
zoning district in which the project is located, but not to exceed the
percentage of the total number of dwelling units in the planned unit
development prescribed for the zoning    district in which the project is
located; see table.
 
DWELLING UNITS IN A PUD

            Single-   Single-
            Family   Family   Multi-
District   Detached   Attached   Family
  R-2        60        60        40
R-3        --        80        60
   (d)   Open space which may include, along with the natural environmental
features, swimming pools, tennis courts and other recreational facilities
deemed permissible by the Planning Commission.  These facilities are to be used
mainly by the residents, and their guests, of the development in which the
facilities are located.  Streets, parking lots, structures for habitation of
storage and the like shall not be included as part of the required open space
and recreational facilities.
   (e)    In planned residential developments having at least 600 dwelling
units, commercial activities shall be permitted that are consistent with the
basic architectural theme of the development.  The construction of commercial
structures shall not begin until fifty percent (50%) of the proposed dwelling
units have been constructed.  The total area on which such commercial
activities occur shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the total acreage of the
proposed development, and shall be integrated with and internal to the
development.  Commercial activities shall be limited to the following kinds of
uses:
      (1)   Personal services such as barber and beauty shops, dry cleaning and
laundry agency, tailor and dressmaker and shoe repair shop.
      (2)   Food sales of the grocery store and/or dairy store type, but not
exceeding 5,000 square feet of floor area in any single space or building.
      (3)   Drug store.
      (4)   Florist and gift shop.
      (5)   Preparation and processing of food and drink to be retailed on
premises including bakery, delicatessen, meat market, confectionery,
restaurant, ice cream parlor and soda fountain, but not exceeding 5,000 square
feet of floor area for any single or combination of the above activities in a
single space or building.
      (6)   Accessory uses clearly incidental to the uses permitted on the same
premises.
   (f)    Only those uses specifically listed herein, and those which are
compatible in character to those types may be permitted by the Planning
Commission, or the Planning and Zoning Board. 
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1183.03  AREA, YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   (a)    Minimum Area for Development.  A planned unit development shall
contain a minimum of twenty acres.  All land within the development shall be
contiguous in that it shall not be divided into segments by any limited access
highway, or any tract of land (other than streets or right of way for pipelines
or electric transmission lines) not owned by the developer of the planned
development.
 
   (b)    Maximum Density of Residential Development.  A planned unit
development shall not exceed the densities prescribed below for the respective
districts:
      R-2 District      5 dwelling units per acre
      R-3 District    14 dwelling units per acre
   Planned unit developments which exceed 100 acres may have a maximum density
exceeding by ten percent (10%) the density set forth above for R-2 and R-
3 Districts.
 
   (c)    Minimum Lot Area for Single-Family Detached Dwellings.
      R-2 Districts      7,500 square feet
      R-3 Districts      7,500 square feet.
 
   (d)    Minimum Yard Requirements for Single-Family Detached Dwellings.
      (1)   Front yard depth measured from the right of way:
         R-2 District      35 feet
         R-3 District      30 feet
Exception: The setback from streets having fifteen or fewer dwelling units
having immediate access to the street shall be not less than twenty-five feet
from the right of way.
      (2)   Rear yard depth:
         R-2 District                30 feet
         R-3 District                20 feet
      (3)   Side yard width for R-2 and R-3 Districts shall be five feet for
either side yard with the sum of both side yards not less than fifteen feet.
      (4)   Minimum lot frontage for all lots on a public thoroughfare shall be
fifty feet in R-2 District and forty feet in the R-3 District.
      (5)   Minimum lot width at building setback line shall be sixty feet.
(Note: Since flexibility of building location is intended within the above
limits for yard requirements, each building site should be selected on the
basis of topographic and land use considerations, and will necessitate the
designation of each building site on the final development plan.  This would
require that the subdivision regulations require building site designation by
deed restrictions in more detail than simply identifying front yard required by
zoning.)
 
   (e)    Minimum Yard Requirements for Single-Family Attached Dwellings and
for Multifamily Dwellings.
      (1)   Front yard depth for R-2 District, forty feet from the right of
way, and in R-3 District, thirty feet from the right of way, plus one foot for
each two feet of height, or a multifamily dwelling structure over forty feet,
except that the setback for single-family attached dwelling structures from the
right of way of streets having fifteen or fewer dwelling units having immediate
access to the street shall not be less than twenty-five feet in all districts.
      (2)   Multifamily structures and single-family attached dwelling
structures shall be separated from any single-family detached dwelling by a
distance not less than twice the height of the multifamily or single-family
attached dwelling structure.  Multifamily structures and single-family attached
dwelling structures, shall be separated from any other multifamily, single-
family attached or nonresidential structure not structurally joined, by a
distance not less than one-half the height of the multifamily or single-family
attached structure with the minimum separation being ten feet.  Multifamily
structures and single-family attached dwelling structures shall be separated
from any project boundary and distance not less than twice the height of the
multifamily or single-family attached structure.
 
   (f)    Height Regulations for Single-Family Detached Dwelling and Single-
Family Attached Dwellings.  No structure shall exceed thirty five feet in
height above the average finished grade line.
 
   (g)    Height Regulations for Multifamily Dwellings.  No structure shall
exceed forty-five feet in height above the average finished grade line in the
R-2 and R-3 Districts.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
      
1183.04  RECREATIONAL AND MEETING FACILITIES.
   All planned unit development projects permitted in any district under this
chapter shall provide indoor recreational and meeting facilities as part of and
integral to the project.  Such facilities shall be available for the use of all
occupants of the total project as defined on the general plans, and shall be
completed at such time as sixty percent (60%) of the total dwelling units
indicated on the general plan are completed and ready for occupancy, and shall
have adequate provisions recorded as part of the dedication plans for the
permanent maintenance and operation of the facilities.  Such facilities shall
be constructed, as a minimum, in proportion to the percentage of the total
project being developed as part of any phase up to the completion of sixty
percent (60%) of the total dwelling units.  Financial guarantees acceptable to
the Planning Commission may be utilized in place of the actual construction of
such facilities up to completion of occupancy of fifty percent (50%) of the
total dwelling units indicated on the general plan.
   The minimum area of the facilities shall be determined as prescribed herein
for the respective districts:
 
      District      Sq. ft./dwelling unit
   (a)   The first fifty acres:
      R-2 District                         15
      R-3 District                          7
   (b)       The acreage that remains:
      R-2 District                           5
      R-3 District                           2.5
      (Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
 
1183.05  PRIVATE STREETS.
   Private streets shall conform to the Subdivision Regulations for local
residential streets except that standards for private streets on which fifteen
or fewer dwelling units have immediate access may be modified upon approval of
Planning Commission after the Planning Commission obtains a recommendation from
the Village Engineer and Fire Chief.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1183.06  COLLECTOR STREETS AND MAJOR THOROUGHFARES.
   Collector streets and major thoroughfares shall be designated as such by the
developer upon submission of general plans as provided in Section
1151.01.  Such designations shall be subject to modification by the Planning
Commission so that an efficient traffic circulation system is established. 
There shall be no direct access from single-family detached residential lots to
a major thoroughfare, and direct access from single-family detached residential
lots to collector thoroughfares shall be minimized.  When there are more than
fifteen dwelling units in a grouping there shall be primary access to such
dwelling units from a public or dedicated street.  The construction of all
streets must conform to the Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1183.07  OFF-STREET PARKING.
   There shall be provided outside public or private right of way a minimum of
two parking spaces for each dwelling unit.  These spaces may be located in the
vicinity of the dwelling unit or in an area designed for guests parking as
deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission.  All parking spaces and service
drives shall be improved with bituminous, concrete or equivalent surfacing and
so graded and drained as to dispose of all surface water accumulation within
the area and shall be subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1183.08  OPEN SPACE.
   At least thirty percent (30%) of the total acres in a proposed development
permitted by this chapter shall be devoted to public and/or private open space
or recreational facilities exclusive of dwellings, streets, parking areas and
single-family residential lots.  Such open space, including any recreational
facilities proposed to be constructed in such space shall be clearly shown on
the general plan, shall be physically situated so as to be readily accessible,
available to and usable by all the residents of the planned unit development. 
All residents of the development shall be permitted use of all open space and
recreation facilities.  Open space and recreational facilities to be included
in this thirty percent (30%) requirement shall not be individually owned or
owned under condominium provisions unless such condominium provisions include
the entire project as shown on the general plan.  For purposes of complying
with the open space requirement, permanent bodies of water indicated on the
most recently published United States Geological Survey maps or as indicated by
more recent aerial photography and field observation shall be credited as one-
half acre of open space for each one acre of water surface area.  Similarly,
areas that the Planning Commission determines are not usable for recreational
space shall be credited with only one-half acre for every one acre of land.  In
addition, limited-use facilities such as golf courses, shall be credited with
only one-half acre for every one acre of land used.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)

(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
 
1183.11  UTILITIES.
   All utilities shall be installed underground.
(Ord. 1500.  Passed 12-14-99.)
1183.12  EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   Effective erosion and sediment controls shall be planned and applied
according to the following principles. (See also Section
1151.01(a)(15).)
   (a)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time
during development.
   (b)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept
to the shortest practical period of time.
   (c)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect critical
areas exposed during development.
   (d)   Sediment basins meaning debris basins, desilting basins, or silt
traps, shall be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters
from land undergoing development.

which shall be retained by the Village to secure the completion of the
Improvement Plans as approved.  The bond shall be in such form as directed by
the Village's Solicitor. 
(Ord. 1446.  Passed 3-11-97.)
1321.99  UNAPPROVED ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED.
   No activities outlined above shall be undertaken until after the Village has
issued a permit allowing them.  In the event that any activities described in
this Chapter are undertaken without submission of an Improvement Plan, approval
of that Plan and receipt of a Village Permit, the Village may immediately seek
a court order terminating such activities, along with damages in an amount not
less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for every day that such
activities have been conducted without Village approval.

CHAPTER 1331
Flood Damage Prevention
1331.01   Statutory authorization, findings of fact; purpose and objectives.
1331.02   Definitions.
1331.03   General provisions.
1331.04   Administration.
1331.05   Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
 
1331.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution, grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the Village Council of the Village of Windham, State of
Ohio does ordain as follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the Village of Windham are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately flood anchored, damage uses in other areas. 
Uses that are inadequately flood roofed, elevated or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.  In order to accomplish its purpose,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights, or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

“substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure.  The term does not, however, include either (1) any project for
improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions, or (2) any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

      (Ord. 1296.  Passed 8-25-87; Ord. 1547.  Passed 1-31-02.)
1331.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which this Chapter Applies.  This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Windham.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  The areas
of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary
Map), #390459B, dated December 14, 1979, and any revision thereto are adopted
by reference and declared to be part of this chapter.
   (c)   Compliance.  Unless specifically exempted from filing for a
development permit as stated in Section
1331.04 (b) no structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions.  However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes.  Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
State law, such State law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (f)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations.  Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes.  This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.  This chapter shall not created liability on the
part of the Village of Windham, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (g)   Violations and Penalties.  Violations of the provisions of this
chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the third degree.  Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions of
and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction
thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village of
Windham.  Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense.  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of Windham from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violations. 
(Ord. 1296.  Passed 8-25-87.)
1331.04  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit.  A Development Permit shall be
obtained before construction or in Section
1331.03 (b).  Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Mayor and may include, but not limited to: plans in duplicate
drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the
area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials,
drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing; and, a description of
the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development.  If base flood elevation data are available, the
following information is also required:
      (1)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures;
      (2)    Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed; and
      (3)    Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1331.05(b)(2).
   (b)   Exemption from Filing A Development Permit.  An application for a
Development Permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting and basement sealing.
   (c)   Designation of the Flood Damage Prevention Administrator.  The Mayor
is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or
denying development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.
   (d)   Duties and Responsibilities of the Mayor.  Shall include but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Permit Review.
         A.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required.  The applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining such permits as required.
         C.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway.  Floodways may be
delineated in other sources of flood information.  If the proposed development
is located within a designated floodway, assure that the encroachment provision
of Section
1331.05(c)(1) is met.
      (2)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data.  Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency are designated as Zone A on the
community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map).  Within
these areas, the Mayor shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other
source in order to administer Section
1331.05 (b)(1), (2) and (c).
      (3)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained.  Where base flood
elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a
community’s Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless
of the source of such data, the following provisions apply:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement.
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1331.04(a)(3).
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of Watercourses.
         A.   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
         B.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the
flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries.  Make interpretation, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions).  Th person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in subsection (e) hereof.
   (e)   Variance Procedure.
      (1)   Appeal Board.
         A.   The Board of Appeals as established by the Village of Windham
shall hear and decide appeals and request for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
         B.   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the Mayor in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
         C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Portage County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         D.   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter; and:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
               damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated developments;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
              10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
            11.   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
         E.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (e)(1)D. and the
purposes of this chapter, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to  further the purposes of
this chapter.
         F.   The Mayor shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and
report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
      (2)   Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (e)(1)D.
have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/
2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variances
increases.
         B.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation,
or restoration of structures listed on the National Resister of Historic Places
or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
         C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         E.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (e)(1)D., or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         F.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
            (Ord. 1296.  Passed 8-25-87.)
1331.05  PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)   General Standards.  In all areas of special flood hazards the
following standards are required:
      (1)    Anchoring.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         B.   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio
Revised Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.  Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
      (2)   Construction Materials and Methods.
         A.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
         B.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         C.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
      (3)   Utilities.
         A.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
         B.   New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and
         C.   Individual waste water treatment systems shall be located to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (4)   Subdivision Proposals.
         A.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
         B.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
         C.   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and
           D.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivisions
proposals, including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed
developments which contain at least fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres
(whichever is less).
   (b)   Specific Standards.  In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Section
1331.04 (d)(2), the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential Construction.  New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         A.   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
         B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the
design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the standards of this subsection.  Such certification
shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1331.04(a)(3).
      (3)   Accessory Structures.  An exemption to the elevation or dry
floodproofing standards may be granted for accessory structures (e.g., sheds,
detached garages) containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area.  Such
structures must meet the encroachment provisions of subsection (c)(1) and the
following additional standards:
         A.   They shall not be used for human habitation;
         B.   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
         C.   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as
to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
         D.   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation; and
         E.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed.
      (4)   Manufactured Homes.  The following standards shall apply to all new
and substantially improved manufactured homes not subject to the manufactured
home requirements of Section 3733.01, Ohio Revised Code.
         A.   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
subsection (a)(1)B.
         B.   Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base
flood elevation.
(Ord. 1296.  Passed 8-25-87.)
      (5)   Enclosures Below Base Flood Elevation. The following standards
apply to all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential non-
basement structures which are elevated to the base flood elevation using
pilings, columns, posts, or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to allow unimpeded movement of flood waters.  Fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are useable solely for parking vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing the entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for
meeting this requirement are:
         A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or
         B.   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above the grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
               (Ord. 1546.  Passed 1-31-02.)
   (c)   Floodways.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more
than one (1) foot.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential.  The Flood Insurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map) does
not designate a floodway.  However, floodways may be delineated in other
available sources of flood information as specified in Section
1331.04 (d)(2).  The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation
demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subsection (c)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and

involved.  Upon the sale or transfer of such property, the housing license may
be transferred to the new owner, operator, and or agent provided that the
current holder of such license applies to the Housing Inspector in writing for
approval of the transfer in advance of the date of transfer.
   (b)   Prior to obtaining a housing license for a residential rental unit the
owner, operator, or agent of such residential rental unit shall make
application on the prescribed forms to the Housing Inspector.  Such application

or more rental units in the structure do not meet the minimum requirements set

application is not on file annually by March 31.  Failure to apply by March

fine to be imposed is double the application fee for the residential rental
unit plus the registration per rental unit.

fee is paid.  The fees are set by action of the Village Council and are
adjusted periodically.  The fee schedule of current effect is available at the

designates in writing to the Housing Inspector the name of his agent for the
receipt of service of notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter and
for service of process pursuant to this chapter.
   (f)   Applications for renewal of housing licenses shall be made sixty days
prior to the expiration of the present operating license.  The Housing
Inspector shall act on all applications within sixty days of receipt of the
application.
   (g)   The original license will be given to the applicant, and a copy shall

equipment changes related to the provisions of this chapter or to any rules and
regulations pertaining thereto, and of all repairs made as the result of
inspections by the Housing Inspector. Such record shall be made available to
the Housing Inspector by the owner or operator when requested. Every owner or
operator subject to this section shall be notified that such record may be used
in administrative or judicial proceedings pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter.

to give notice of the issuance of a current housing license to tenants by one
of the following authorized methods prior to occupancy:
      (1)   Place upon all written rental agreements the following Notice:
"This residential rental unit is licensed by the Village of Windham for the
period of ___________________ , 20 ____ to ____________________ , 20 _______.
Be advised that both landlords and tenants have certain responsibilities to
each other as are set forth in the Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code of
the Village of Windham. Copies of said Code can be obtained at the Windham
Village Hall."
or
      (2)   Give the following written notice separate from the written rental
agreement: "This residential rental unit(s) is licensed by the Village of

forth in the Housing Maintenance and Occupancy Code of the Village of Windham.
Copies of said Code can be obtained at the Windham Village Hall."
   The length of the licensing period and the number of occupants shall be
filled in by the owner, or agent from information appearing on the housing
license for said residential rental unit prior to the execution of the rental
agreement by the tenant.
   If the rental agreement is oral, the owner, operator, or agent shall deliver
to the tenant a written statement and notice as is described in subsection (h)
(2) above, on or before the receipt of any monies from the tenant under said
oral agreement.
   (j)   An owner of a newly-constructed or converted residential rental unit
must obtain a rental license before any renter is permitted to occupy said
residential rental unit.
   (k)   When the license fee described in this Section
1341.08 is not paid when due, the Housing Inspector shall notify the Fiscal
Officer who may do either or both of the following:
      (1)   Certify the amount to the County Auditor, who shall place the
certified amount on the real property tax list and duplicate against the
subject property (the property subject to inspection and payment of the license
fee and associated fines).  The amount certified shall be a lien on the
property served from the date placed on the list and duplicate and shall be
collected in the same manner as other taxes, except that, notwithstanding Ohio
R.C. 323.15, the County Treasurer shall accept a payment in such amount when
separately tendered as payment for the full amount of such unpaid license fee. 
The lien shall be released immediately upon payment in full of the certified
amount.  Unless the Fiscal Officer determines that a transfer of the property
is about to occur, the Fiscal Officer may only make a certification under this
regulation if the license fee has been due and unpaid for at least sixty days
and the Fiscal Officer or other official or body has provided the owner of the
property with written notice of the impending certification at least thirty
(30) days prior to the certification; or
      (2)   Collect the license fee amount by actions at law, in the name of
the Village from the owner.
   Upon collection of the license fee and associated fines, the Housing
Inspector shall schedule an inspection of the subject property.  Only upon
passing the inspection shall the Housing Inspector issue a license for the
Residential Rental Unit for that calendar year.

undue hardship would result from literal application of any section of this
Code. Where such undue hardship is clearly demonstrated, the Board may permit a
variance from the applicable section if the dwelling will vary only a
reasonable minimum from the literal provision of this Code, but will comply
with the spirit and intent of this Code with respect to sanitation, safety, and
rehabilitation. All decisions to permit a variance under this section shall be
by majority vote of the total membership of the Board.
         (Ord. 1320.  Passed 12-12-89.)

Board of Appeals, provided that such person shall file in the office of the

grounds for such hearing and appeal from any order of the Housing Inspector. 
Petitions shall be filed within fourteen days after the date of notice and
order is served and shall be accompanied by a deposit of one hundred dollars

hearing shall commence thirty days after the petition has been filed.  At such
hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show
cause why such notice and order should be modified or withdrawn.  The failure
of the petitioner or his representative to appear and state his case at such
hearing shall be grounds for dismissal of such petition.
         (Ord. 1339.  Passed 4-10-90; Ord. 0-2007-14.  Passed 11-20-07.)
      (2)   Upon hearing, the Housing Appeals Board may affirm, amend, modify,

1505.01  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This chapter is enacted for the purpose of complying with the requirements
of Ohio R.C. 3929.86.  In the event of a conflict with Ohio R.C. 3929.86 and
this chapter of the Windham Codified Ordinances or other ambiguity it is the
intention of the Village of Windham that this section be interpreted in a
fashion that will give full effect to the procedures established in the Ohio

   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3929.86, no insurance company which is doing business
in the State of Ohio shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a
structure which is located within the Village in those instances when the
aggregate amount recoverable under all policies for the fire loss to the
structure exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) without complying with the
provisions of this chapter.  (Ord. 2012-9.  Passed 4-26-12.)
1505.03  AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS TO BE DEPOSITED WITH  THE VILLAGE.
   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the

structure, the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 
715.26(F), shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Village
Administrator in the aggregate two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000) and each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or, if
at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds
and the insurance company or companies, the named insured or insureds have
submitted a contractor’s signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or

proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.  (Ord. 2012-9.  Passed 4-26-12.)
1505.04  PRO RATA CONTRIBUTIONS REQUIRED WHEN MULTIPLE COVERAGE EXISTS.
   The proceeds which must be transferred as required in Section
1511.03 shall be done on a pro rata basis by all companies insuring the
building or other structure.  Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to
the Village shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
(Ord. 2012-9.  Passed 4-26-12.)
1505.05  VILLAGE ADMINISTRATOR DESIGNATED TO RECEIVE FUNDS.
   When transferring the funds as required by this chapter, the insurance
company or companies making such transfer shall provide the Village
Administrator with the name and address of the named insured or insureds,
certify the amount of the proceeds that have been forwarded to the Village, and
notify such named insured or insureds of such transfer and the procedures
created by this chapter and under Ohio R.C.  3929.86 with respect to the
ultimate disposition of the funds so transferred.  The Village Administrator
shall deposit the proceeds with the Fiscal Officer who shall place the proceeds
in a separate fund to be used solely as security for the costs incurred by the
Village pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 2012-9.  Passed 4-26-12.)
1505.06  TIME LIMIT ON NOTICE BY VILLAGE TO NAMED INSURED.
   As soon as is reasonable, but in no event later than sixty days following
the receipt of the name and address of the named insured or insureds, as
required by Section
 1511.05, the Village Administrator shall provide the named insured or insureds
with a complete and detailed list of all actions which must be taken with
respect to the fire damaged building or structure so as to permit the release
of all insurance funds which are being held by the Village.  Upon receipt of
such list the named insured or insureds may submit a contractor’s signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, whereupon the Village Administrator shall cause
to be transferred to the named insured or insureds the amount of the fund in
excess of said estimate, provided that the Village has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure.
(Ord. 2012-9.  Passed 4-26-12.)
1505.07  DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   Funds held by the Village pursuant to this chapter shall be paid to the
named insured or insureds when repairs, or removal or securing of the building
or other structure have been completed and the required proof received by the
Village Administrator, but only if the Village has not incurred any costs for
such repairs, removal or securing.  If the Village has incurred any costs for
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the Village shall
transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds.  Nothing in this
section shall be construed to limit the ability of the Village to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(Ord. 2012-9.  Passed 4-26-12.)
1505.99  PENALTY.
