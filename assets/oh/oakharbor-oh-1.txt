and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.

of the subject matter taken as a whole.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect

intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of such error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,

inclusion herein, but such amendment need not be inserted in this code, but
shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein. Any chapter, section, or
division repealed by subsequent ordinances may be excluded from this code by
omission from reprinted pages. Subsequent ordinances as printed or omitted
shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until the

§ 30.01 APPLICATION OF TITLE III.
   (A)   Title III of this code of ordinances is designed to include and
incorporate, insofar as is practical, all legislation concerning the
organization, qualifications, appointment or election, terms of office,
compensation, and the powers and duties of the officials, boards, and bodies of
the village. Pertinent sections of the Ohio Revised Code relative to these
village offices and boards have been assembled and adopted as a part of this
Title. No material changes of the Revised Code sections referred to in the
legislative histories have been made. The purpose of including these sections
is to afford easy reference to the statutory provisions.
   (B)   In the interest of uniformity and consistency, most references to
“village,” as the term appears in the Revised Code, have been changed to read
“municipality” throughout this Title. However, the provisions of this Chapter
shall only apply to the administration of village local government.
§ 30.02 QUALIFICATIONS; OATHS.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section or in
another section of the Revised Code, each officer of the municipality or of any
department or board of the municipality, whether elected or appointed as a
substitute for a regular officer, shall be an elector of the municipality, and,
before entering upon official duties, shall take an oath to support the
Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State, and an
oath that the officer will faithfully, honestly, and impartially discharge the
duties of the office to which elected or appointed. These provisions as to
official oaths shall extend to deputies, but they need not be electors.
   (B)   Neither this section nor any section of the Revised Code requires, or
shall be construed to require, that a Fire Chief be an elector of the
municipality.
(R.C. § 733.68)
§ 30.03 BONDS OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES; AMOUNT.
   Before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, each officer and
employee, where such is required by the legislative authority, shall execute a
bond approved according to law in the amount set forth for his or her
respective office or position.
§ 30.04 ADDITIONAL BOND; WHERE BONDS RECORDED AND KEPT.
   Except as otherwise provided in the municipal charter or in R.C. § 3.061,
each officer required by law or ordinance to give bond shall do so before
entering upon the duties of the office. Except as otherwise provided in the
municipal charter or in R.C. § 3.061, the Legislative Authority may at any time
require each officer to give a new or additional bond. Each bond, except that
of the Auditor or Clerk, upon its approval, shall be delivered to the Auditor
or Clerk, who shall immediately record it in a record provided for that purpose
and file and carefully preserve it in the Auditor's or Clerk's office. The bond
of the Auditor or Clerk shall be delivered to the Treasurer, who shall in like
manner record and preserve it.
(R.C. § 733.69)
§ 30.05 APPROVAL OF BONDS.
   The official bonds of all municipal officers shall be prepared by the
Solicitor or Director of Law. Except as otherwise provided in state law, the
bonds shall be in a sum as the Legislative Authority prescribes by general or
special ordinance, and be subject to the approval of the Mayor, except that the
Mayor's bond shall be approved by the Legislative Authority, or, if it is not
legally organized, by the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas of the county in
which the municipality or the larger part thereof is situated.
(R.C. § 733.70)
§ 30.06 SUFFICIENCY OF FORM OF BOND.
   In each bond mentioned in §
30.05, the condition that the person elected or appointed shall faithfully
perform the duties of the office shall be sufficient. The fact that the
instrument is without a seal, that blanks for the date or amount have been
filled subsequent to its execution but before its acceptance, without the
consent of the sureties, that all the obligees named in the instrument have not
signed it, that new duties have been imposed on the officers or that any merely
formal objection exists shall not be available in any suit on the instrument.
(R.C. § 733.71)
§ 30.07 FILLING VACANCIES IN OFFICES.
   Unless otherwise provided by law, vacancies arising in appointive and
elective offices of the municipality shall be filled by appointment by the
Mayor for the remainder of the unexpired term, provided that:
   (A)   Vacancies in the office of the Mayor shall be filled in the manner
provided by §
31.17;
   (B)   Vacancies in the membership of the Legislative Authority shall be
filled in the manner provided by §
32.06;
   (C)   Vacancies in the office of President Pro Tempore of the Legislative
Authority shall be filled in the manner provided by §
32.03;
   (D)   Vacancies in the office of Clerk or Treasurer may be filled in the
following manner: The Mayor may appoint a person to serve as acting officer to
perform the duties of the office until a permanent officer is appointed to fill
the vacancy.
(R.C. § 733.31(A))
§ 30.08 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
   (A)   Upon request by any person and subject to division (H) of this
section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly
prepared and made available for inspection to the requester at all reasonable
times during regular business hours. Subject to division (H) of this section,
upon request by any person, a public office or person responsible for public
records shall make copies of the requested public record available to the
requestor at cost and within a reasonable period of time. If a public record
contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection
or to copy the public record, the public office or the person responsible for
the public record shall make available all of the information within the public
record that is not exempt. When making that public record available for public
inspection or copying that public record, the public office or the person
responsible for the public record shall notify the requester of any redaction
or make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of
a request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if federal or
state law authorizes or requires a public office to make the redaction.
   (B)   To facilitate broader access to public records, a public office or the
person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public
records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying
in accordance with this section. A public office also shall have available a
copy of its current records retention schedule at a location readily available
to the public. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under
this section such that the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are
being requested, the public office or the person responsible for the requested
public record may deny the request but shall provide the requester with an
opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary
course of the public office’s or person’s duties.
   (C)   If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in whole, the public
office or the person responsible for the requested public record shall provide
the requester with an explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why
the request was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the
explanation also shall be provided to the requester in writing. The explanation
shall not preclude the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record from relying upon additional reasons or legal authority
in defending an action commenced under R.C. § 149.43(C).
   (D)   Unless specifically required or authorized by state or federal law or
in accordance this section, no public office or person responsible for public
records may limit or condition the availability of public records by requiring
disclosure of the requester’s identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. Any requirement that the requester disclose the requester’s
identity or the intended use of the requested public record constitutes a
denial of the request.
   (E)   A public office or person responsible for public records may ask a
requester to make the request in writing, may ask for the requester’s identity,
and may inquire about the intended use of the information requested, but may do
so only after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not
mandatory and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester’s identity
or the intended use and when a written request or disclosure of the identity or
intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public
office or person responsible for public records to identify, locate, or deliver
the public records sought by the requester.
   (F)   If any person requests a copy of a public record in accordance with
this section, the public office or person responsible for the public record may
require the requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the copy
of the public record in accordance with the choice made by the requester under
this division. The public office or the person responsible for the public
record shall permit the requester to choose to have the public record
duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any other medium
upon which the public office or person responsible for the public record
determines that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of the
normal operations of the public office or person responsible for the public
record. When the requester makes a choice under this division, the public
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide a copy of it
in accordance with the choice made by the requester. Nothing in this section
requires a public office or person responsible for the public record to allow
the requester of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public
record.
   (G)   (1)   Upon a request made in accordance with this section and subject
to division (F) of this section, a public office or person responsible for
public records shall transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission within a
reasonable period of time after receiving the request for the copy. The public
office or person responsible for the public record may require the person
making the request to pay in advance the cost of postage if the copy is
transmitted by United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in advance the costs
incurred for other supplies used in the mailing, delivery, or transmission.
      (2)   Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures that it will
follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period of time after receiving a
request, copies of public records by United States mail or by any other means
of delivery or transmission pursuant to division (G) of this section. A public
office that adopts a policy and procedures under division (G) of this section
shall comply with them in performing its duties under that division.
      (3)   In any policy and procedures adopted under division (G) of this
section:
         (a)   A public office may limit the number of records requested by a
person that the office will physically deliver by United States mail or by
another delivery service to ten per month, unless the person certifies to the
office in writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the
requested records, or the information contained in them, for commercial
purposes.
         (b)   A public office that chooses to provide some or all of its
public records on a web site that is fully accessible to and searchable by
members of the public at all times, other than during acts of God outside the
public office’s control or maintenance, and that charges no fee to search,
access, download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, may
limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a person that the
office will deliver in a digital format, unless the requested records are not
provided on the web site and unless the person certifies to the office in
writing that the person does not intend to use or forward the requested
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes.
         (c)   For purposes of division (G) of this section, COMMERCIAL shall
be narrowly construed and does not include reporting or gathering news,
reporting or gathering information to assist citizen oversight or understanding
the operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational research.
   (H)   A public office or person responsible for public records is not
required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal
conviction or a juvenile adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any
public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning
what would be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request to inspect or to
obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is
subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who
imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or
the judge’s successor in office, finds that the information sought in the
public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of
the person.
   (I)   (1)   Upon written request made and signed by a journalist, a public
office, or person responsible for public records, having custody of the records
of the agency employing a specified designated public service worker, as
defined in R.C. § 149.43, shall disclose to the journalist the address of the
actual personal residence of the designated public service worker and, if the
designated public service worker's spouse, former spouse or child is employed
by a public office, the name and address of the employer of the designated
public service worker's spouse, former spouse or child. The request shall
include the journalist's name and title and the name and address of the
journalist's employer and shall state that disclosure of the information sought
would be in the public interest.
      (2)   Division (I)(1) of this section also applies to journalist requests
for:
         (a)   Customer information maintained by a municipally owned or
operated public utility, other than social security numbers and any private
financial information such as credit reports, payment methods, credit card
numbers, and bank account information.
         (b)    Information about minors involved in a school vehicle accident
as provided in division R.C. § 149.43(A)(1)(gg), other than personal
information as defined in R.C. § 149.45.
      (3)   As used in this division (I), JOURNALIST means a person engaged in,
connected with, or employed by any news medium, including a newspaper,
magazine, press association, news agency, or wire service, a radio or
television station, or a similar medium, for the purpose of gathering,
processing, transmitting, compiling, editing, or disseminating information for
the general public.
   (J)   Upon a request made by a victim, victim's attorney, or victim's
representative, as that term is used in R.C. § 2930.02, a public office or
person responsible for public records shall transmit a copy of a depiction of
the victim as described in R.C. § 149.43(A)(1)(ii) to the victim, victim's
attorney, or victim's representative.
   (K)   (1)   To ensure that all employees of public offices are appropriately
educated about a public office's obligations under this section, all elected
officials or their appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the
Attorney General as provided in R.C. § 109.43. A future official may satisfy
the requirements of this division by attending the training before taking
office, provided that the future official may not send a designee in the future
official's place.
      (2)   All public offices shall adopt a public records policy in
compliance with this section for responding to public records requests. In
adopting a public records policy under this division, a public office may
obtain guidance from the model public records policy developed and provided to
the public office by the Attorney General under R.C. § 109.43. Except as
otherwise provided in this section or R.C. § 149.43, the policy may not limit
the number of public records that the public office will make available to a
single person, may not limit the number of public records that it will make
available during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed period
of time before it will respond to a request for inspection or copying of public
records, unless that period is less than eight hours.
      (3)   The public office shall distribute the public records policy
adopted by the public office under this division (K) to the employee of the
public office who is the records custodian or records manager or otherwise has
custody of the records of that office. The public office shall require that
employee to acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. The
public office shall create a poster that describes its public records policy
and shall post the poster in a conspicuous place in the public office and in
all locations where the public office has branch offices. The public office may
post its public records policy on the internet web site of the public office if
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public office that has
established a manual or handbook of its general policies and procedures for all
employees of the public office shall include the public records policy of the
public office in the manual or handbook.

a reasonable fee, may obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings at
which any specific type of public business is to be discussed. Provisions for
advance notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the agenda of
meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in self-
addressed, stamped envelopes provided by the person.
   (F)   Except as provided division (F)(8) of this section, the members of a
public body may hold an executive session only after a majority of a quorum of
the public body determines, by a roll call vote, to hold an executive session
and only at a regular or special meeting for the sole purpose of the
consideration of any of the following matters:
      (1)   To consider the appointment, employ-ment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee, or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as
otherwise provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for
the discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of
the elected official's official duties or for the elected official's removal
from office. If a public body holds an executive session pursuant to division
(F)(1) of this section, the motion and vote to hold that executive session
shall state which one or more of the approved purposes listed in division (F)
(1) of this section are the purposes for which the executive session is to be
held, but need not include the name of any person to be considered at the
meeting.
      (2)   (a)   To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, the
sale of property at competitive bidding, or the sale or other disposition of
unneeded, obsolete, or unfit- for-use property in accordance with R.C. §
505.10, if premature disclosure of information would give an unfair competitive
or bargaining advantage to a person whose personal, private interest is adverse
to the general public interest. No member of a public body shall use this
division (F)(2) as a subterfuge for providing covert information to prospective
buyers or sellers. A purchase or sale of public property is void if the seller
or buyer of the public property has received covert information from a member
of a public body that has not been disclosed to the general public in
sufficient time for other prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit
offers.
         (b)   If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and
deliberations of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this
section, any instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey,
lease, or otherwise dispose of any right, title, or interest in any public
property shall be conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance
with this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide
purchasers, lessees, or transferees of the property is concerned.
      (3)   Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning
disputes involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action;
      (4)   Preparing for, conducting, or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
      (5)   Matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or
regulations or state statutes;
      (6)   Specialized details of security arrangements if disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
      (7)    In the case of a county hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Chapter
339, a joint township hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Chapter 513, or a
municipal hospital operated pursuant to R.C. Chapter 749, to consider trade
secrets, as defined in R.C. § 1333.61;
      (8)   To consider confidential information related to the marketing
plans, specific business strategy, production techniques, trade secrets, or
personal financial statements of an applicant for economic development
assistance, or to negotiations with other political subdivisions respecting
requests for economic development assistance, provided that both of the
following conditions apply:
         (a)   The information is directly related to a request for economic
development assistance that is to be provided or administered under any
provision of R.C. Chapter 715, 725, 1724, or 1728 or R.C. §§ 701.07, 3735.67 to
3735.70, 5709.40 to 5709.43, 5709.61 to 5709.69, 5709.73 to 5709.75, or 5709.77
to 5709.81, or that involves public infrastructure improvements or the
extension of utility services that are directly related to an economic
development project.
         (b)   A unanimous quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call
vote, that the executive session is necessary to protect the interests of the
applicant or the possible investment or expenditure of public funds to be made
in connection with the economic development project.
      (9)   If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in divisions (F)(2) through (F)(8) of this section, the motion
and vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved matters listed in those divisions are to be considered at the
executive session.
      (10)   A public body specified in division (c) of the definition of
“public body” in this section shall not hold an executive session when meeting
for the purposes specified in that division (c).
   (G)   A resolution, rule, or formal action of any kind is invalid unless
adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule, or formal
action adopted in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting
not open to the public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose
specifically authorized in division (F) of this section and conducted at an
executive session held in compliance with this section. A resolution, rule or
formal action adopted in an open meeting is invalid if the public body that
adopted the resolution, rule, or formal action violated division (E) of this
section.
   (H)   (1)   Any person may bring an action to enforce this section. An
action under this division (H)(1) shall be brought within two years after the
date of the alleged violation or threatened violation. Upon proof of a
violation or threatened violation of this section in an action brought by any
person, the court of common pleas shall issue an injunction to compel the
members of the public body to comply with its provisions.
      (2)   (a)   If the court of common pleas issues an injunction pursuant to
division (H)(1) of this section, the court shall order the public body that it
enjoins to pay a civil forfeiture of $500 to the party that sought the
injunction and shall award to that party all court costs and, subject to
reduction as described in this division (H)(2), reasonable attorney’s fees. The
court, in its discretion, may reduce an award of attorney’s fees to the party
that sought the injunction or not award attorney’s fees to that party if the
court determines both of the following:
            1.   That, based on the ordinary application of statutory law and
case law as it existed at the time of violation or threatened violation that
was the basis of the injunction, a well-informed public body reasonably would
believe that the public body was not violating or threatening to violate this
section;
            2.   That a well-informed public body reasonably would believe that
the conduct or threatened conduct that was the basis of the injunction would
serve the public policy that underlies the authority that is asserted as
permitting that conduct or threatened conduct.
         (b)   If the court of common pleas does not issue an injunction
pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section and the court determines at that
time that the bringing of the action was frivolous conduct, as defined in R.C.
§ 2323.51(A), the court shall award to the public body all court costs and
reasonable attorney’s fees, as determined by the court.
      (3)   Irreparable harm and prejudice to the party that sought the
injunction shall be conclusively and irrebuttably presumed upon proof of a
violation or threatened violation of this section.
      (4)   A member of a public body who knowingly violates an injunction
issued pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section may be removed from office
by an action brought in the court of common pleas for that purpose by the
prosecuting attorney or the attorney general.

the political subdivision is located or in any adjacent county in this state.
For purposes of this section, an initiative petition shall be filed and

   (B)   (1)   A petition may be filed with the Clerk, signed by registered
electors residing in the municipality equal in number to not less than 10% of
the total vote cast for all candidates for Governor in the municipality at the
most recent general election at which a Governor was elected, requesting that
the question be placed before the electors whether, instead of the Legislative
Authority appointing legal counsel for the municipality or for any department
or official of the municipality, the Mayor shall appoint an attorney or law
firm as the legal counsel with the advice and consent of the Legislative
Authority. Within two weeks after receipt of the petition, the Clerk shall
certify it to the Board of Elections, which shall determine its sufficiency and
validity. The petition shall be certified to the Board of Elections not less
than 90 days prior to the election at which the question is to be voted upon.
      (2)   At the election, if a majority of the electors of the municipality
approves the question, then effective immediately when the Mayor considers it
necessary, the Mayor shall appoint, with the advice and consent of the
Legislative Authority, an attorney or law firm as legal counsel for the
municipality, or for any department or official of the municipality, for a
period not to exceed two years. The appointment of legal counsel under this
division shall be pursuant to a contract approved by the Mayor and a majority
vote of the Legislative Authority. The contract shall provide for the
compensation and other terms of the engagement of the legal counsel, and the
Legislative Authority shall provide that compensation for the legal counsel.
   (C)   When acting under this section, the Legislative Authority acts in its
administrative capacity.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 32.01 MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY; ELECTION; TERMS OF OFFICE.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) or (C) of this section,
the legislative power of each municipality shall be vested in, and exercised
by, a Legislative Authority, composed of six members, who shall be elected by
the electors of the municipality at large, for terms of four years.
   (B)   The Legislative Authority may adopt an ordinance or resolution that,
if approved by a majority of the electors voting on the issue, would reduce the
number of members of the Legislative Authority to five. A certified copy of the
ordinance or resolution shall be filed with the Board of Elections no later
than 4:00 p.m. of the ninetieth day before the day of the next election at
which members of the Legislative Authority are to be elected.
   (C)   The electors may propose a reduction in the number of members of the
Legislative Authority from six to five by initiative petition in accordance
with the procedure set forth in R.C. § 731.28.
   (D)   If a majority of the votes cast on the question proposed under
division (B) or (C) of this section is in the affirmative, the Legislative
Authority shall be composed of five members, who shall be elected at large, for
terms of four years. If members of the Legislative Authority have staggered
terms of office as required by this section, the decrease in number of members
shall be implemented as necessary over the next two municipal elections at
which members of the Legislative Authority would be elected. If the Legislative
Authority has adopted an ordinance or resolution to eliminate staggered terms
of office under division (E) of this section, the five members shall be elected
as set forth in division (E)(2)(b) of this section.
(R.C. § 731.09)
   (E)   (1)   The Legislative Authority may, by the adoption of an ordinance
or resolution to eliminate staggered terms of office, determine that all
members of the Legislative Authority shall be elected at the same municipal
election as provided for in this section.
      (2)   At the regular municipal election occurring not less than 90 days
after the certification of the ordinance or resolution to the Board of
Elections eliminating staggered terms of office, the following apply:
         (a)   If there are six members of the Legislative Authority, the
number of members eligible for election at that regular municipal election
shall be elected to two-year nonstaggered terms, and all members of the
Legislative Authority shall be elected to four-year nonstaggered terms at all
following municipal elections.
         (b)   If there are five members of the Legislative Authority, a number
of members that is one less than the number of members that would otherwise be
eligible for election at that regular municipal election but for the first-time
implementation of the new membership of five, or, in the case of a village that
has previously reduced its number of members to five, then the number of
members eligible for election at that regular municipal election shall be
elected to two-year nonstaggered terms, and all members shall be elected to
four-year nonstaggered terms at all following municipal elections.
(R.C. § 731.091)
§ 32.02 PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE; EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   At the first meeting in January of each year, the Legislative
Authority shall immediately proceed to elect a President Pro Tempore from its
own number, who shall serve until the first meeting in January next after his
or her election. The Legislative Authority may provide employees for the
municipality as it determines, and employees may be removed at any regular
meeting by a majority of the members elected to the Legislative Authority.
   (B)   When the Mayor is absent from the municipality, or is unable, for any
cause, to perform his or her duties, the President Pro Tempore shall be the
acting Mayor, and shall have the same powers and perform the same duties as the
Mayor.
(R.C. § 731.10)
§ 32.03 VACANCY WHEN PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE BECOMES MAYOR.
   When the President Pro Tempore of the Legislative Authority becomes the
Mayor, the vacancy thus created shall be filled as provided in §
32.06, and the Legislative Authority shall elect another President Pro Tempore
from its own number, who shall have the same rights, powers, and duties as his
or her predecessor.
(R.C. § 731.11)
§ 32.04 QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Each member of the Legislative Authority shall have resided in the
municipality for at least one year immediately preceding the member's election,
and shall be an elector of the municipality. No member of the Legislative
Authority shall hold any other public office, be interested in any contract
with the municipality, or hold employment with the municipality, except that
the member may be a notary public or a member of the state militia. Any member
who ceases to possess any of these qualifications, or who moves from the
municipality, shall forfeit his or her office.
   (B)   The purpose of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this
section is to recognize that the municipality has a substantial and compelling
interest in encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of
member of the Legislative Authority by ensuring that a candidate for the office
has every opportunity to become knowledgeable with and concerned about the
problems and needs of the area the candidate seeks to represent. In enacting
this requirement, the municipality finds that the one-year period is reasonably
related to this purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person's right to travel,
to vote, and to be a candidate for public office.
(R.C. § 731.12)
§ 32.05 COMPENSATION AND BONDS OF MUNICIPAL OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.
   The Legislative Authority shall fix the compensation and bonds of all
officers, clerks, and employees of the municipality, except as otherwise
provided by law. The Legislative Authority shall, in the case of elective
officers, fix their compensation for the ensuing term of office at a meeting
held not later than five days prior to the last day fixed by law for filing as
a candidate for such office. All bonds shall be made with sureties subject to
the approval of the Mayor. The compensation so fixed shall not be increased or
diminished during the term for which any officer is elected or appointed. This
section does not prohibit the payment of any increased costs of continuing to
provide the identical benefits provided to an officer at the commencement of
his or her term of office.
(R.C. § 731.13)
§ 32.06 VACANCY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, when the
office of a member of the Legislative Authority becomes vacant, the vacancy
shall be filled by election by the Legislative Authority for the unexpired
term. If the Legislative Authority fails within 30 days to fill the vacancy,
the Mayor shall fill it by appointment, except that subject to division (B) of
this section, when the vacancy occurs because of the operation of §
31.17, the successor shall hold office only for the period the President Pro
Tempore of the Legislative Authority holds the office of Mayor.
   (B)   When a vacancy occurs in the office of a member of the Legislative
Authority of a village with a population of less than 2,000 because of the
operation of §
31.17, at the time the President Pro Tempore becomes Mayor, the President Pro
Tempore shall decide whether he or she wishes to serve the remainder of his or
her unexpired term as a member of the Legislative Authority when the Mayor's
successor is elected and qualified in accordance with §
31.17. If the President Pro Tempore decides to serve the remainder of his or
her unexpired term as a member of the Legislative Authority, the vacancy on the
Legislative Authority shall not be filled and the President Pro Tempore shall
resume serving his or her unexpired term on the Legislative Authority as soon
as the Mayor's successor is elected and qualified. If the President Pro Tempore
decides not to resume serving the remainder of his or her unexpired term as a
member of the Legislative Authority as soon as the Mayor's successor is elected
and qualified, then the vacancy in the office of the member of the Legislative
Authority shall be filled in accordance with this section.
(R.C. § 731.43(A))
§ 32.07 JUDGE OF ELECTION AND QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS; QUORUM AND SPECIAL
MEETINGS.
   The Legislative Authority shall be the judge of the election and
qualification of its members. A majority of all the members elected shall be a
quorum, but a less number may adjourn from day to day and compel attendance of
absent members in a manner and under penalties as are prescribed by ordinance.
The Legislative Authority shall provide rules for the manner of calling special
meetings.

Cross-reference:
   Open meetings, see §
30.09
§ 32.08 RULES; JOURNAL; EXPULSION OF MEMBERS.
   The Legislative Authority shall determine its own rules, and keep a journal
of its proceedings. It may punish or expel any member for disorderly conduct or
violation of its rules, and declare his or her seat vacant for absence without
valid excuse, where the absence has continued for two months. No expulsion
shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds of all the members
elected, and until the delinquent member has been notified of the charge
against him or her, and has had an opportunity to be heard.
(R.C. § 731.45)
§ 32.09 MEETINGS; REGULAR MEETING DATE.
   (A)   The Legislative Authority shall not be required to hold more than one
regular meeting in each week. The meetings may be held at a time and place as
is prescribed by ordinance, and shall, at all times, be open to the public. The
Mayor, or any three members of the Legislative Authority, may call special
meetings upon at least 12 hours' notice to each member, served personally or
left at his or her usual place of residence.
(R.C. § 731.46)
   (B)   The regular meeting date of the Legislative Authority (Village
Council) is hereby changed from the first and third Tuesday of each month to
the first and third Monday of each month, commencing at 7:30 p.m.

   Open meetings, see §

§ 32.10 GENERAL POWERS.

(R.C. § 731.47)
§ 32.11 FAILURE TO TAKE OATH OR GIVE BOND.
   The Legislative Authority may declare vacant the office of any person
elected or appointed to the office who, within ten days after he or she has
been notified of his or her appointment or election, or obligation to give a
new or additional bond, fails to take the required official oath or to give any
bond required of him or her.

Statutory reference:
   Ordinances and resolutions generally, see R.C. §§ 731.17 - 731.27

time and place of service, shall be recorded in the proceedings of the
Legislative Authority.
   (B)   If the officer fails to give such new bond, with sureties, to the
satisfaction of the Mayor, within ten days after such service, the Legislative
Authority shall declare the office vacant, and the vacancy shall be filled in
the manner provided in Title VII of the Revised Code.
   (C)   When a new bond is accepted or the Legislative Authority declares the
office vacant, the sureties of the original bond shall cease to be liable for
the acts of such officer done thereafter, but shall continue to be liable for
his or her acts then already done.

modifications in such contract, such alterations or modifications shall be made

powers and duties as are granted to or imposed upon a Mayor under this

§ 33.04 MAYOR'S COURT MAGISTRATE.
   (A)   A Mayor of a municipality that has a Mayor's Court may appoint a
person as Mayor's Court Magistrate to hear and determine prosecutions and
criminal cases in the Mayor's Court that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor's Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01. No person shall be appointed as
a Mayor's Court Magistrate unless the person has been admitted to the practice
of law in this state and, for a total of at least three years preceding his or
her appointment or the commencement of his or her service as magistrate, has
been engaged in the practice of law in this state or served as a judge of a
court of record in any jurisdiction in the United States, or both.
      (1)   A person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under this
division is entitled to hear and determine prosecutions and criminal cases in
the Mayor's Court that are within the jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court, as set
forth in R.C. § 1905.01. If a Mayor is prohibited from hearing or determining a
prosecution or cause that charges a person with a violation of R.C. § 4511.19
or a municipal OVI ordinance as defined in R.C. § 4511.180 due to the operation
of R.C. § 1905.03(C), or is prohibited from hearing or determining any other
prosecution or cause due to the operation of R.C. § 1905.031(C), the
prohibition against the Mayor hearing or determining the prosecution or causes
does not affect and shall not be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or
authority of a person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under this
division to hear and determine the prosecution or cause in accordance with this
section. In hearing and determining such prosecutions and causes, the
magistrate has the same powers, duties, and authority as does a Mayor who
conducts a Mayor's Court to hear and determine prosecutions and causes in
general, including, but not limited to, the power and authority to decide the
prosecution or cause, enter judgement, and impose sentence; the powers, duties,
and authority granted to Mayors of Mayor's Courts by this chapter, in relation
to the hearing and determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor's Courts;
and the powers, duties, and authority granted to Mayors of Mayor's Courts by
any provisions of the Revised Code, in relation to the hearing and
determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor's Courts. A judgement entered
and a sentence imposed by a Mayor's Court Magistrate do not have to be reviewed
or approved by the Mayor who appointed the Magistrate, and have the same force
and effect as if they had been entered or imposed by the Mayor.
      (2)   A person appointed as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under this
division is not entitled to hear or determine any prosecution or criminal cause
other than prosecutions and causes that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor's Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.
      (3)   A municipality that a Mayor's Court Magistrate serves shall pay the
compensation for the services of the Magistrate, which shall be either a fixed
annual salary set by the Legislative Authority or a fixed annual amount or fees
for services rendered set under a contract the Magistrate and the municipality
enter into.
   (B)   The appointment of a person as a Mayor's Court Magistrate under
division (A) of this section does not preclude the Mayor that appointed the
Magistrate, subject to the limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.03 and the
limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.031, from also hearing and determining
prosecutions and criminal causes in the Mayor's Court that are within the
jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.

recent non- certified copy of a driver’s abstract from the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles.
   (D)   If the accused is served as required by the Rules of Civil Procedure
or by any special statutory proceedings that are relevant to the case, the
court may order the attachment of the person of the accused upon failure to
appear as ordered by the court.

of its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, as
follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused
by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the
employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority. The
following are full defenses to that liability:
         (a)   A member of a municipal police department or any other police
agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call and
the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct;

operation complies with the precautions of R.C. § 4511.03.

that the municipality does not have the responsibility for maintaining or
inspecting the bridge.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that
is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the
grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of,
buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental
function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but

detention facility, as defined in R.C. § 2921.01.

construed to exist under another section of this code or the Revised Code
merely because that section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty upon a
political subdivision, because that section provides for a criminal penalty,
because of a general authorization in that section that a political subdivision
may sue and be sued, or because that section uses the term "shall" in a
provision pertaining to a political subdivision.
   (C)   An order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a
political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as
provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.
(R.C. § 2744.02)
§ 36.03 DEFENSES AND IMMUNITIES.

loss to persons or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses
or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:

involved was engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial,
prosecutorial, legislative, or quasi-legislative function.
      (2)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the conduct
of the employee involved, other than negligent conduct, that gave rise to the

of the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was necessary
or essential to the exercise of powers of the political subdivision or
employee.
      (3)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of
liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy
making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and
responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.
      (4)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the political subdivision or employee involved that gave rise
to the claim of liability, resulted in injury or death to a person who had been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who, at the time of
the injury or death, was serving any portion of his or her sentence by
performing community service work for or in the political subdivision whether
pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 or otherwise, or resulted in injury or death to a
child who was found to be a delinquent child and who, at the time of the injury
or death, was performing community service or community work for or in a
political subdivision in accordance with the order of a juvenile court entered
pursuant to R.C. § 2152.19 or 2152.20, and if, at the time of that person's or

Chapter 4123 in connection with the community service or community work for or
in the political subdivision.
      (5)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury,
death, or loss to persons or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or

supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources, unless the
judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or
in a wanton or reckless manner.

following applies:
         (a)   His or her acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope
of his or her employment or official responsibilities;
         (b)   His or her acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad
faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;
         (c)   Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a

Officer of a political subdivision, an assistant of any such person, or a judge

subdivision, to pay the judgment or a specified portion of the judgment in
annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years, subject to the
payment of interest at the rate specified in R.C. § 1343.03(A). A court shall
not authorize the payment in installments under this division of any portion of
a judgment or entire judgment that represents the actual loss of the person who
is awarded the damages.
         (b)   Additionally, a court shall not authorize the payment in
installments under this division of any portion of a judgment or entire
judgment that does not represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded
the damages unless the court, after balancing the interests of the political
subdivision and of the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered,
determines that installment payments would be appropriate under the

was rendered. If a court makes that determination, it shall fix the amount of
the installment payments in a manner that achieves for the person in whose
favor the judgment was rendered the same economic result over the period as
that person would have received if the judgment or portion of the judgment
subject to the installment payments had been paid in a lump sum payment.

division (A) of this section and that is rendered in favor of the state may be
paid in equal annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years,

   (A)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (A)(2) of this section,
a political subdivision shall provide for the defense of an employee, in any

with respect to any claim for injury, death, or loss to person or property
caused by an act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary
function.
      (2)   No action or appeal of any kind shall be brought by any person,

with respect to its and its employees' potential liability in damages in civil
actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by
an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The insurance may be at
the limits, for the circumstances, and subject to the terms and conditions,
that are determined by the political subdivision in its discretion. The
insurance may be for the period of time that is set forth in specifications for
competitive bids or, when competitive bidding is not required, for the period
of time that is mutually agreed upon by the political subdivision and insurance
company. The period of time does not have to be, but can be, limited to the
fiscal cycle under which the political subdivision is funded and operated.
      (2)   (a)   Regardless of whether a political subdivision procures a
policy of liability insurance pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section or
otherwise, the political subdivision may establish and maintain a self-
insurance program relative to its and its employees' potential liability in
damages in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of
its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The
political subdivision may reserve such funds as it deems appropriate in a
special fund that may be established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of
the political subdivision and not subject to R.C. § 5705.12. The political
subdivision may allocate the costs of insurance of a self-insurance program, or
both, among the funds or accounts in the subdivision's treasury on the basis of
relative exposure and loss experience. The political subdivision may require
any deductibles under an insurance or self- insurance program, or both, to be
paid from funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury from which a loss was
directly attributable. If it so chooses, the political subdivision may contract
with any person, other political subdivision, or regional council of
governments for purposes of the administration of such program.
         (b)   Political subdivisions that have established self-insurance
programs relative to their and their employees' potential liability as
described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section may mutually agree that their
self-insurance programs will be jointly administered in a specific manner.
   (B)   The purchase of liability insurance, or the establishment and
maintenance of a self-insurance program, by a political subdivision does not
constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision or
its employees, except that the political subdivision may specifically waive any
immunity or defense to which it or its employees may be entitled if a provision
to that effect is specifically included in the policy of insurance or in a
written plan of operation of the self-insurance program, or if any, the
legislative enactment of the political subdivision authorizing the purchase of
the insurance or the establishment and maintenance of the self-insurance
program. Such a specific waiver shall be only to the extent of the insurance or
self-insurance program coverage.
   (C)   The authorizations for political subdivisions to secure insurance and
to establish and maintain self-insurance programs in this section are in
addition to any other authority to secure insurance or to establish and
maintain self-insurance programs that is granted pursuant to the Revised Code
or the Ohio Constitution, and they are not in derogation of any other
authorization.
(R.C. § 2744.08)
   (D)   If a political subdivision, pursuant to division (A)(2)(a) of this
section or a joint self-insurance pool pursuant to R.C. § 2744.081, has
allocated costs to, or required the payment of deductibles from, funds or
accounts in the subdivision’s treasury, the subdivisions’s fiscal officer,
pursuant to ordinance or resolution of the Legislative Authority, shall
transfer amounts equal to those costs or deductibles from the funds or accounts
of the subdivision’s General Fund if both of the following occur:
      (1)   The subdivision requests payment from the employee responsible for
the funds or accounts for those costs or deductibles;
      (2)   The employee receiving the request fails to remit payment within 45
days after the date of receipt of the request.
   (E)   The provisions of R.C. §§ 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 do not apply

§ 38A.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAX; REFUND OF OVERPAYMENT.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions of §
38A.16, all taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible by the Tax
Department, or its authorized agent, together with any interest, penalties and
reasonable administrative costs thereon, by suit, or by other means as other
debts of like amount are recoverable. No additional assessment shall be made
after three years from the time of payment of any tax due hereunder, provided,
however, that there shall be no period of limitation on an additional
assessment in the case of a return that omits gross income of 25% of that
required to be reported, or in the case of the filing of a false or fraudulent
return with the intent to evade the tax, or in the case of failure to file a
return. Reasonable administrative costs associated with the delinquent tax
collection includes, but is not limited to, fees no less than 25% of the total
delinquent amount, including the tax amount, interest and penalties of any post
judgment account assigned to a collection agency and no greater than 35% of the
total delinquent amount, including tax amount, interest and penalties of any
prejudgment account assigned to a collection agency. In those cases in which
the Administrator of the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer have
executed a waiver of the federal statute of limitations, the period within
which an additional assessment may be made by the Tax Administrator shall be
extended three years from the time of the final determination of the federal
tax liability, except that taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless
a claim for refund is made within three years after the final determination of
the federal tax liability.
   (B)   Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a
corporation or association shall be personally liable for failure to file the
return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required. The
dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any employer does not discharge
the officers’ or employees’ liability for a prior failure of such business to
file a return or pay the taxes due.
   (C)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after final determination of the federal
tax liability, whichever is later.
   (D)   Amounts of less than $5 need not be collected and shall not be
refunded.

of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Oak Harbor to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under §
38B.04(C);
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Oak Harbor
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Oak Harbor, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Oak Harbor may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a fairer apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
38B.12(A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §
38B.12(A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (F)(3)(b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in Oak Harbor if,
regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within Oak Harbor from
a stock of goods located within Oak Harbor.
            2.   The property is delivered within Oak Harbor from a location
outside Oak Harbor, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within Oak Harbor and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within Oak Harbor to
purchasers outside Oak Harbor, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to Oak
Harbor to the extent that such services are performed in Oak Harbor.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Oak Harbor shall be sitused to Oak Harbor.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Oak Harbor shall be sitused to Oak
Harbor.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Oak Harbor based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Oak Harbor.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to Oak Harbor's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Oak Harbor or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Oak Harbor.

the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in Oak Harbor
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of Oak Harbor shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Oak Harbor. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under Oak Harbor's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)   Left intentionally blank.
      (9)   Intentionally left blank.
   (G)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   QUALIFYING REMOTE EMPLOYEE OR OWNER means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   REPORTING LOCATION means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under § 38B.04, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. or 2. of this section, the location that
the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2) of this section:
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to § 38B.04.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding Provisions.
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Oak Harbor shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Oak Harbor. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under §
38B.03 or division (B)(4) or (B)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in §
38B.01(B)(1), of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Oak Harbor the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Oak Harbor in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Oak Harbor in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
            Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Oak Harbor. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Oak Harbor as the return
required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Oak Harbor income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Oak Harbor the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to Oak
Harbor income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Oak Harbor until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Oak Harbor during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Oak Harbor income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days in a
calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (C)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted

this section, an employer is not required to withhold Oak Harbor income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Oak Harbor if the employee performed such services in Oak Harbor on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in Oak
Harbor.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Oak Harbor. For the purposes of this division, PRESUMED
WORKSITE LOCATION means a construction site or other temporary worksite in Oak
Harbor at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last

more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in §
38B.04.

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in Oak
Harbor only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Oak Harbor than in any other municipal corporation on
that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent
in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            3.    Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Oak Harbor exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Oak Harbor for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Oak Harbor.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for Oak Harbor
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for Oak
Harbor for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in Oak Harbor.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Oak Harbor and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in § 38B.02, the employer shall
withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a
taxable year and remit that tax only to Oak Harbor, regardless of the number of
days which the employee worked outside the corporate boundaries of Oak Harbor.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §

following documents: All of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: The taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form l120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Oak Harbor to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of R.C. § 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Oak Harbor. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,

if the net amount due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Oak Harbor's income tax
return. The extended due date of Oak Harbor's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of Oak Harbor's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the 11th month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under
this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Oak Harbor's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Oak Harbor income tax return. If the request is received
by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Oak Harbor income tax return
is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of Oak
Harbor's income tax return. The extended due date of Oak Harbor's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by Oak Harbor, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (G)(3), or (G)(4) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Oak Harbor shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Oak Harbor for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with Oak Harbor an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Oak Harbor income tax ordinance for
a taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with Oak Harbor
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in § 38B.04(C)(1)(g)) within Oak
Harbor.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in Oak Harbor and does
not expect to be subject to Oak Harbor income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Oak Harbor. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within Oak Harbor, make any sales in Oak Harbor, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by Oak Harbor during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by Oak Harbor for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with Oak Harbor income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for Oak Harbor by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in §
38B.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Oak Harbor, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Oak Harbor and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by Oak Harbor to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Oak Harbor, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Oak
Harbor or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of Oak Harbor's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Oak
Harbor's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension
for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown
to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Oak Harbor
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by Oak Harbor during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to Oak Harbor before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (O)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by Oak Harbor in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (O)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN means a consolidated return
filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (3)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME means the consolidated taxable
income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the purposes of
filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before consideration of net
operating losses or special deductions. CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME
does not include income or loss of an incumbent local exchange carrier that is
excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)(1) of this section.
      (4)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER has the same meaning as in R.C. §

   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Oak Harbor's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (S)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or (S)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
      (5)   When an election is made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Oak Harbor. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (V)(3), and
(V)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
38B.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under § 38B.02(C)(2) to the extent
that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has
been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of §
38B.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Oak
Harbor. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of §
38B.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Oak
Harbor. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass- through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of §
38B.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to Oak
Harbor;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Oak Harbor income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of §
38B.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Oak Harbor income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Oak Harbor in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Oak Harbor before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Oak Harbor may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by

becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.

return in accordance with R.C. § 718.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
38B.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the
amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with Oak Harbor under §
38B.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Oak Harbor but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes

      (1)   Overpayments of more than $10 or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10 or
more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
38B.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
38B.18(A)(4).
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with Oak Harbor, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Oak Harbor as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Oak Harbor is subject to recovery by Oak Harbor. If
Oak Harbor's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Oak Harbor
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Oak Harbor
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)   If Oak Harbor's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Oak
Harbor's tax rate. However, if Oak Harbor's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Oak Harbor, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Oak Harbor changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with Oak
Harbor. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
38B.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of §
38B.12 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by Oak Harbor. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in §
38B.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Oak Harbor tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Oak Harbor return showing income subject to Oak
Harbor income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Oak Harbor income tax shown
due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than $10.

§ 38B.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
file with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
38B.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
38B.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Oak Harbor does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
38B.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of §
38B.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover Oak Harbor income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest, or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
      This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is
not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using  reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS means an address to which the postal service
or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver
an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery
is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Oak Harbor official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete,
and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
      "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(l) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Oak Harbor
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
Oak Harbor that arises pursuant to Oak Harbor's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of Oak Harbor:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Oak Harbor as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit Oak Harbor from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 13-2023, passed 12-4-23)
§ 38B.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Oak Harbor ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud Oak Harbor or the Tax Administrator.

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Oak Harbor to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an

or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying

identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with

to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
38B.99 for a violation of §
38B.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

   (A)   Generally.  
      (1)   These general rules and regulations cover the furnishing and supply
of electric service by the village, sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
“utility” or “municipality,” to its consumers.
      (2)   As hereinafter used, “consumer” shall be construed to be any
individual, firm, corporation, association, political subdivision, or any other
identity using the village's electric service.
      (3)   All of these general rules and regulations shall be applicable to
all of village's electric rate schedules as if fully set forth in the
schedules.
      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the Village Administrator to
enforce these general rules and regulations.
      (5)   The Village Administrator may supplement these rules and
regulations with such other administrative rules, forms and specifications as
may be necessary to properly enforce and administer these general rules and
regulations and the applicable rate schedules and to comply with the intent of
same.
   (B)   Applicability. These rules and regulations together with the
provisions of the applicable rate schedule are part of every service contract
entered into by the utility.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.002 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   POINT OF SERVICE. May be referred to as delivery point. The utility will
extend its facilities to the point of attachment designated by the company on
the consumer's pole, building, or suitable structure. The attachment may be
owned by the utility at its option and is considered the point of service.
Metering may or may not be located at the point of service. Meter location will
be determined by the utility. Each meter and/or voltage level is the point of
service.
   SERVICE VOLTAGE. The normal service voltage is single-phase, 60 hertz, 120/
240 volts, 3 wire. At the utility's option, other voltages and/or three-phase
service may be made available as specified in §
50.021. All voltages are nominal subject to standard variations.
   OVERHEAD AND UNDERGROUND SERVICE. All service will normally be supplied by
means of overhead service facilities. At the utility's option, underground
facilities may be furnished in conformance to the utility's standards and
charges for such service as hereinafter set forth.
   TEMPORARY SERVICE. All service applications for campers, trailers, portable
tools, house or other construction, and the like, shall normally be considered
as being temporary in character and shall be subject to the provisions
hereafter set forth.
   SUBDIVISION. Where two or more residences, mobile homes, and/or trailers are
determined by the utility to be permanent housing facilities located on the
same common tract of land, the same shall be defined and constitute as being a
subdivision or park and will be served under the utility's current policy.
   SPECIAL CHARGES. The furnishing of reconnection, disconnection, temporary
and other special services shall be subject to the schedule of charges set
forth in §
50.072.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.003 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   (A)   All applications for service shall be in writing on the utility's
standard form and shall be made at the office of utility, accompanied by all
applicable fees and deposits as specified hereafter. When accepted by the
utility, the application shall constitute a binding contract between the
applicant and the utility in conformance to these general rules and
regulations, and the applicable rate schedule. See §
50.076 as to responsibility for payment of bills.
   (B)   Residential and incidental farm service. 
      (1)   Where the premises are occupied by a tenant or where the utility
determines that the service to be furnished is temporary in character, the
utility reserves the right to require the application for service to be in the
name of the property owner, who shall be responsible for the payment of all
bills for electric service.
      (2)   The utility reserves the right to bill and mail the bill direct to
the tenant and to require the tenant to make suitable advance deposit to secure
payment of all bills. However, such deposit is for the protection of property
owner and in no manner relieves property owner of his or her responsibility for
payment of bills.
   (C)   Limitation of 200 feet free extension. 
      (1)   This covers extensions to serve permanent buildings and other
facilities. The utility's rate schedules are applicable, where the extension
required to be made by the utility for the combined primary, secondary, and
service drop facilities does not exceed 200 feet from the point of origin as
determined by utility. Where the extension of facilities exceeds 200 feet, see
§
50.026.
      (2)   Where extensions are greater than 200 feet, or when unusual
facilities or capacity is required to meet the consumer's requirements, the
same will be financed as provided under unusual service extensions at §
50.026.
   (D)   Elements of dwelling unit permanency. A dwelling unit is considered
permanent if all of the following conditions are complied with:
      (1)   Both the land and dwellings are owned by the same individual.
      (2)   The water system is permanent.
      (3)   The sewage system is permanent.
      (4)   The structure is located on a permanent foundation as determined by
the utility.
      (5)   If a mobile home or trailer is involved, all wheels must be removed
and the unit is mounted on a permanent foundation.
   (E)   Temporary service. All service applications for campers, trailers,
portable tools, house, other construction work and the like shall normally be
considered as being temporary in character, as further provided in §
50.025.
   (F)   Trailer and mobile home courts. 
      (1)   Where two or more trailers or the like are involved, such service
may, at option of the utility, be served through a central metering point.
      (2)   Where more than one unit is served through one meter, the billing
procedure shall be as specified under §
50.070(B) as multiple dwelling units. Where four or more mobile homes or
trailers are served through one meter, the general service rate shall apply.
However, such service shall not be submetered or resold by the owner or
operator. If this requirement is violated, service shall be subject to
disconnection upon 24 hours written notice by the utility.
      (3)   If owner desires that each unit be individually metered and billed,
all wiring beyond the pole on which the main service drop is terminated shall
be owned, operated and maintained and installed at the owner's expense.
      (4)   If the utility determines that the mobile home is a permanent
installation, the utility may elect to install all secondary wiring and service
drops.
      (5)   Billing will commence with the first billing month following the
date that the utility establishes service to the meter pole. For bill
responsibility, see §§
50.070 et seq.
   (G)   Right-of-way. Before electric service is established, any necessary
right-of-way easements must be executed by the property owner on the utility's
standard right-of-way form. If the applicant for electric service is not the
owner of the property to be supplied with electric service, it will be the
responsibility of the applicant to assist in obtaining the necessary right-of-
way, not only for the property to be served with electricity, but also all
other properties it may be necessary to cross with the utility's electric lines
in order to furnish the electric service.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.004 UTILITY'S LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   As herein used, the consumer and property owner are one and the same.
   (A)   The utility's responsibility terminates at delivery point. The
consumer shall be solely responsible for all wiring, equipment and
appurtenances located beyond the point where the utility's wires and fixtures
are first connected to the consumer's wiring equipment. The point shall be
defined as the utility's point of delivery of service. The delivery point will
normally be where the consumer's service entrance wires are connected to the
utility's service drop conductors. Where the utility's metering equipment is
installed within the consumer's wiring system, the delivery point shall also be
defined and considered as the point where the utility's service wires first
contact the consumer's wiring or service entrance conductors.
   (B)   The utility is not responsible for utilization of electric energy
beyond delivery point. The consumer shall be responsible for the utilization of
all electric energy delivered to the consumer's premises. The consumer shall be
further responsible for any injuries to person or property arising from, caused
by, or incident to his or her failure to properly install, operate or maintain
any wiring appliances or other appurtenances located on the consumer's side of
the aforementioned delivery point, including any defects in the consumer's
wiring and his or her equipment.
   (C)   The utility will use reasonable diligence in furnishing a regular and
uninterrupted supply of energy but shall not be liable for damages in case such
supply or service should be interrupted, reduced or fail by reason of an act of
God, the public enemy, accidents, strikes, legal process, state or municipal
interferences, breakdown or injury to the machinery or distribution lines of
the utility, the temporary discontinuance of service in order to make repairs,
or for other cause.
   (D)   The utility shall not be liable for damages, if the supply or service
is discontinued due to any cause set forth under §
50.007.
   (E)   The utility will provide and maintain in proper operating condition
the necessary line or service connections, transformers (when owned by the
utility), meters and other appurtenances as may be required to furnish service
to its consumers. All such equipment and appurtenances shall be owned, operated
and maintained by the utility.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.005 CONSUMER'S LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   As herein used, the consumer and property owner are one and the same.
   (A)   Consumer's responsibility commences at utility's delivery point. The
consumer shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of all wiring,
equipment and other electrical appurtenances up to the utility's delivery point
as defined in §
50.004. The consumer shall also be responsible for the utilization of all
electric service delivered to the consumer by the utility at the delivery point
and as further set forth in §
50.004(B).
   (B)   The consumer shall be responsible for all electricity used on the
premises occupied by him or her and his or her service contract or application
until reasonable notice has been given by him or her at the utility's office to
discontinue the supply of electric service. Such discontinuance of service
shall in no way relieve the consumer or property owner of the responsibility of
payment of bills as specified in §§
50.003,
50.006 and
50.073 and elsewhere in these general rules and regulations.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.006 ILLEGAL DIVERSION OF ELECTRICITY; DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (A)   In the event that the utility finds that its metering equipment or its
wiring or connections have been tampered with so as to prevent proper
registration of the quantity of electricity used on the premises, the following
procedure will be applicable:
      (1)   The utility reserves the right to discontinue its service at once
and without notice to the consumer or any premises for any of the following
reasons:
         (a)   If electricity consuming devices are connected ahead of the
utility's meter or metering equipment, or if connections or devices of any kind
are found installed on the premises of a consumer which would prevent the meter
from registering the total amount of electricity then being used or which may
be subsequently used on the premises.
         (b)   If inspection by the utility shows or indicates that any one has
interfered or tampered with any wiring, connections, seals, conduits, equipment
or appurtenances, and that interference or tampering may have prevented in the
past or could prevent in the future the meter registering the total amount of
electricity used.
      (2)   Upon disconnection of service for any of the above reasons, the
following procedure shall apply and be followed before service is restored:
         (a)   The utility shall, in any reasonable manner, estimate or compute
the amount of unmetered electricity used and shall have the right to inspect
the premises and to make an accurate survey of all current consuming devices in
order to arrive at the probable quantity of unmetered electricity used by the
consumer.
         (b)   The consumer shall pay for all metered and estimated unmetered
electricity in accordance with the applicable rate schedule, plus any damages
to the utility's metering equipment or installation.
         (c)   As referred to in §
50.072, special reconnection charges shall be paid by the consumer to cover
part of the additional expense the consumer has caused the utility to
investigate and correct the fraud or crime.
         (d)   The consumer shall install, at his expense, all necessary rigid
conduit and approved cable plus such protective devices that will, in the
utility's opinion, minimize future tampering of the utility's metering
equipment. If the utility so determines, the consumer shall also pay all of the
expense caused to move the utility's metering equipment to another location on
the consumer's premises or elsewhere, so as to prevent the future diversion or
theft of electricity from the utility.
   (B)   The above does not affect, waive or modify any possible action or
prosecution under the laws and criminal status of this state pertaining to this
crime.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.007 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE.
   (A)   The utility reserves the right to discontinue the supply of electrical
energy and to disconnect its service or remove its equipment and facilities
from the consumer's premises for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   When the consumer is in arrears in the payment of bills, or fails
to comply with any of these rules and regulations.
      (2)   For fraud or to prevent fraud involving the illegal diversion of
electricity as specified in §
50.006.
      (3)   When the consumer has moved from the premises or requested
disconnection of service.
      (4)   For willful destruction of the utility's property located on the
consumer's premises and for nonpayment of such property destruction by the
consumer.
      (5)   If the consumer's service is detrimental to the service furnished
by the utility to other consumers and the consumer fails or refuses to correct
the situation after reasonable notice has been given to the consumer by the
utility.
      (6)   For necessary repairs to the utility's system or for unavoidable
shortages or interruptions in the source of the utility's supply.
      (7)   For any unsafe or hazardous installations that jeopardized the
safety of either the public or employees of the utility or the property of the
utility.
      (8)   When unauthorized devices are attached to the utility's facilities,
as further provided in §
50.030.
      (9)   When continuance of the furnishing of service by the utility is
determined to be incompatible or unlawful by reason of an order issued by a
state or federal government regulatory authority or by any political
subdivision thereof.
   (B)   Any such suspension of service shall not terminate or reduce the term
of any contract between the utility and the consumer nor shall it abrogate any
applicable service or minimum charge.
   (C)   To the extent applicable, the disconnection and reconnection of
service, for any of the disconnected above causes, shall be subject to the
applicable charges specified in §
50.072.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.008 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE; NOTICE TO CONSUMERS.
   Notice to discontinue service may be given to the consumer by whichever of
the following methods is applicable:
   (A)   For nonpayment of bill.
      (1)   All consumer bills shall clearly state that the bill is due and
payable and the date that service will be subject to disconnection for
nonpayment of the bill. The discontinuance of service shall be made in
accordance with §
52.26.
      (2)   As an alternate, the utility may give a separate printed notice by
mail to the consumer at least five days in advance of the date that service is
to be disconnected by the utility.
   (B)   When utility's metering equipment has been tampered with. When the
illegal diversion of electricity specified in §
50.006 occurs or exists, no advance notice of disconnection of service will be
given. At time of such disconnection of service, the utility's employees may
give verbal notice to the consumer or to any of his or her employees who may be
on the premises.
   (C)   For violation of other rules and regulations. Notice may be given by
any of the following methods:
      (1)   Notice given to the consumer, or to his or her agent or employee on
the premises orally, personally or by telephone by an authorized representative
of the utility.
      (2)   If the violation jeopardizes the safety of the public or the
utility's employees or the utility's property, service may be disconnected
without notice. In such an event, it will be subsequently followed by oral and
written notice, describing the violation involved.
      (3)   Written notice by prepaid mail deposited in the United States Post
Office.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85; Am. Ord. 15-2011, passed 1-17-12)
§ 50.009 RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   To the extent feasible, the utility's distribution and transmission
lines and appurtenances will be constructed within the right-of-way boundaries
of streets, roads and alleys. Whenever, in the opinion of the utility, it is
not practical to construct and install its facilities within the limits of
streets, alleys and other public thoroughfares, the utility will construct and
install such facilities on private right-of-ways.
   (B)   Whenever it is necessary for the utility to occupy private right-of-
way, property owner shall furnish or assist in acquiring, without charge to the
utility, such right-of-way as is necessary and will assist the utility in
securing such other right-of-way as may be necessary to provide service to the
consumer. See also §
50.003(G).
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)

premises. If this restriction is violated, the utility reserves the right to
discontinue service without notice.
   (B)   Interconnection of buildings.
      (1)   Where the consumer's installation contains two or more buildings
and such buildings are separated by street, alley, railroad right-of-way, or
other public thoroughfare and where there is no other intervening property
occupied by others, the consumer, at his or her own expense and responsibility,
and subject to the approval of the utility, may interconnect such buildings so
as to enable the consumer to receive all of his or her electric service
requirements at one service and meter location and to be so billed.
      (2)   The privilege is not transferrable and automatically terminates if

§ 50.040 OVERHEAD DISTRIBUTION FOR NEW SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   General policy. 
      (1)   A subdivision may consist of two or more lots or tracts of land to
be supplied with electric service by the utility. As to what constitutes a
subdivision and if the policy set forth herein applies, such shall be
determined by the utility.
      (2)   The utility will cooperate with the developer, building and the
consumer and will extend its overhead distribution facilities to serve new
residential subdivisions, subject to the execution of a suitable contract
between the utility and the developer.
      (3)   Such contract shall specify or incorporate by reference the
following terms and conditions to be fully complied with before service will be
established:
         (a)   That developer's plot plan has been recorded and approved by
zoning authorities, political subdivisions and all governmental bodies having
jurisdiction over such matters.
         (b)   That water and sewage development plans have been approved,
including the specified dates for commencement of construction and completion
of the project. In addition, a detailed plan for the financing of such water
and sewage facilities must be submitted together with the approval of the
governmental authorities having jurisdiction over same.
         (c)   That the point of origin of the new construction shall commence
at a point that is not more than 200 feet distance from the utility's existing
facilities.
         (d)   That all distribution facilities shall be overhead. Such
facilities shall include but are not limited to the service drop, transformers,
meters and all related appurtenances. All service and conditions are subject to
utility's general rules and regulations as set forth herein. For underground
facilities, see §
50.041.
         (e)   That before any subdivision lots or tracts of land are sold, a
right-of-way easement shall be executed between the owner of the entire
subdivision tract of land and the utility. The easement shall constitute a
covenant which shall be a part of and shall run concurrently with each and
every subsequent deed transfer that involves any parcel of land located within
the subdivision. The covenant shall grant to utility whichever of the following
provisions the utility deems as being appropriate and necessary.
            1.   A suitable perpetual right-of-way easement that will permit
the installation, operation, maintenance and replacement of all the utility's
distribution facilities and appurtenances required to serve every lot or tract
of land in the subdivision, including the right of ingress and egress by the
utility and the right to trim trees and shrubbery.
            2.   A covenant covering the cost of street lighting service, if
the subdivision is located outside the corporate limits of the municipality.

manner specified in division (A) of this section, the utility will supply
service to a specified areas of the subdivision at no cost to the developer or
owner of the specified area, providing the point of origin is not more than 200
feet distance from the utility's existing distribution facilities.
         (b)   In the event that the point of origin is more than 200 feet from
the nearest property line of the initial subdivision area to be served, the
developer or owner shall pay 100% of the cost commencing 200 feet from the
point of origin and extending to such initial subdivision area.
         (c)   The rate and the utility's general rules and regulations
applicable for the electric service shall be the same as those in effect
elsewhere by utility. Such applicable rate schedule may contain an initial one-
time service connection charge per consumer for new services to be paid by the
consumer.
      (2)   When the developer or owner pays the cost of distribution
facilities.
         (a)   If the subdivision development plan does not conform to all of
the terms and conditions previously specified, the developer shall pay in
advance to utility as a non-refundable aid-to-construction all of the costs of
the distribution facilities to be installed by the utility in the subdivision
and located beyond the previously defined point of origin. Such costs include
the installed cost of primary, transformers, service drops, meters, plus all
other appurtenances required to furnish and deliver electric service to the
premises involved.
         (b)   Under this plan, the utility may, at its option, elect to refund
to the developer at the end of each calendar year 20% of the gross metered
electric revenue received by the utility in the same year from its electric
consumers located in the particular area involved. If the utility has elected
to make such refunds, same shall cease at the end of five years.

capacity or an unusual installation is involved, the village reserves the right
to require consumer to install the complete substation, in which event the
substation discount may apply.
   (C)   Secondary service. Service will normally be supplied through a single
set of service wires. The voltage shall, at the village's option, be either
120/240 volt single phase 3 wire; 240/480 volt 3-phase, 3 wire or 120/208 or
277/480 volt, 3-phase, 4 wire. If the voltage requested is impractical for the
village to furnish, consumer shall furnish at his expense such transformers as
are necessary to deliver such voltage. The village shall specify whether or not
the billing kWh is to be based on service metered at primary or secondary
voltage.
   (D)   Motor specifications. In order to avoid the operation and/or starting
of motors that are detrimental to service furnished other consumers, the
village reserves the right to require that such motors be equipped with such
reduced voltage and/or other control devices as are necessary to avoid
detrimental service to the village's other consumers.
   (E)   Three-phase service for unbalanced or fluctuating loads. For highly
fluctuating loads, such as welders, electric melting furnaces and/or other
unbalanced single phase loads, the village reserves the right to require that
such loads be converted to three-phase operation so that as far as is practical
the load on each phase is balanced.
   (F)   Power factor and voltage control. Where consumer installs power factor
corrective equipment, the village may require consumer to install at his
expense, such control devices as are necessary to prevent excessive or
detrimental voltage variations on the village's system. In event of such
noncompliance by consumer, the RkW billing capacity will be determined as
though said power factor correction equipment was disconnected.
   (G)   Use of service. Under no condition shall service be resold, sub-
metered or shared with others. Violation of this provision shall be cause for
disconnection of service.
   (H)   General rules and regulations. For further details as to the rights,
responsibilities, and obligations of both the village and consumer, see the
village's General Rules and Regulations which apply to service under this
subchapter as if fully written herein.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 50.070 RATE CLASSIFICATION AND APPLICATION.
   (A)   Residential classification.
      (1)   This classification applies to all uses usually considered in the
public utility industry as being strictly residential, domestic, home or
incidental farm use in character and where not more than one single-family
dwelling unit is served through one meter except as set forth in division (B)
of this section. The residential classification is only applicable for 120/240
volt single-phase service.
      (2)   All non-residential use or three-phase electric service shall be
classified as general service or power service and shall be billed as specified
below.
   (B)   Multiple dwelling units. 
      (1)   At option of the utility, where service is furnished to no more
than three dwelling units, apartments, mobile homes or trailers, such service
shall be billed on the residential rate with the rate blocks, service and
minimum charge to be multiplied by the number of dwelling units, apartments,
mobile homes or trailers connected to the service drop.
      (2)   Where four or more dwelling units, apartments or trailers are
served through one meter, the general service rate shall apply as specified in
division (I) of this section.
      (3)   In the event that service to a multiple dwelling unit is
disconnected or a change in ownership or billing name is made, the utility
reserves the right to require, at that time, that each dwelling unit be
separately metered and billed before service is re-established.
      (4)   The owner of an apartment house, or a single-family house which is
converted or constructed so as to contain separate and individual living
quarters or dwelling units for more than one family, shall upon request of the
utility install at his or her expense separate wiring so that each dwelling
unit can be metered and billed separately. Where such separate wiring has been
installed in accordance with the utility's specifications, the dwelling unit
shall be billed under the residential schedule. The utility reserves the right
to require all future multiple dwelling units to be separately metered and
billed.
   (C)   Combined residential and non-residential service. Where the premises
are used and occupied by a consumer as a non-residential or business
establishment and also as a residence, all service supplied will be billed
under the applicable non-residential or general service schedule, or at the
consumer's option, the wiring may be separated (subject to the utility's
approval) and each class of service separately metered and billed accordingly.
   (D)   Rooming houses. 
      (1)   Where the primary purpose of the electric service, as determined by
the utility, is principally for domestic use by a single-family with boarders
being taken in for incidental income, the service shall be classed as
residential.
      (2)   Where the domestic electric service use of such family is
incidental and the principal activity or electric service use is for a rooming,
tourist or boarding house, all service shall be classed and billed as non-
residential or general service. Where a majority of rooms on the premises are
rented or are intended to be rented, it shall be deemed that the principal use
is for a rooming, tourist or boarding house and therefore the service shall be
classified as non-residential or general service as specified in division (I)
of this section.
   (E)   Religious and similar dwelling units. Individual buildings that are
primarily used for residences of individuals located in orphanages, children's
homes, parsonages and the like will be served under the residential schedule
providing the service is 120/240 volts, single-phase and the demand at the
individual meter does not exceed the limitation set forth in the residential
schedule.
   (F)   Trailers and mobile homes. Such service shall be considered as
temporary service unless elements of permanency exist, including permanent
foundation, approved sanitary facilities and the like. For further details, see
§
50.003(F).
   (G)   Three-phase service. 
      (1)   This service is not available under the residential rate
classification. Where three-phase service is furnished, all service (both
single-phase and three-phase) will be billed under the applicable general
service or power rate schedule unless the single-phase and three-phase services
are separately metered and billed in conformance to the applicable rate
schedule.
      (2)   Where three-phase service is furnished, the applicable service and
minimum charge shall be effective on a 12-month year-round basis and seasonal
or other interim disconnects will not avoid the service and minimum charge
except as may be specified in the applicable rate schedule.
   (H)   Combined single-phase and three-phase service. Non-residential or
general service power service will be billed as a single bill for each service
location; provided, however, that all of the consumer's wiring is terminated at
a single service and meter location (to be determined by the utility) and only
a single three- or four-wire service drop is used to supply service. If service
is supplied to more than one service or meter location or if more than a single
three- or four-wire service is installed, separate billing will apply for each
service or meter.
   (I)   General service classification. 
      (1)   This classification and applicable rate shall apply to service
furnished for any use that is not strictly residential, home or incidental farm
use in character. It also applies to residential service where the demand
exceeds the limitations set forth in the residential schedule.
      (2)   Such non-residential or general service use includes service
furnished to more than three dwelling units served through a single meter,
churches, trailer camps, restaurants, hotels, rooming houses, apartment houses,
tourist courts, schools, orphanages, stores, professional and other offices,
clubs, theaters, businesses, and the like, plus all other establishments or
activities that are non-residential or non-home use in character.
      (3)   Any establishment carrying a business, professional or commercial
telephone directory listing will be considered as non-residential and the
general service or power service rates shall apply. However, the absence of
such telephone listing shall not be considered as establishing as to whether or
not the service is residential or non-residential.
      (4)   The non-residential classification shall also apply where either an
external or internal business advertising sign or similar evidence is visible
from the outside of the building or structure; also where other external
visible evidence makes it obvious that non-residential activities are being
carried out on the premises involved.
   (J)   Rural general service classification. 
      (1)   Service in rural areas shall be considered as non-residential or
general service in character where such service is not incidental to general
farming operations as defined by the limitations set forth in the utility's
residential schedule or where such service is used for the preparation of
processing of food or other products to the extent that same are substantially
in a form that can be used or can be readily adopted for use by or for sale to
the ultimate consumer.
      (2)   In addition, in order to avoid discrimination, all service supplied
in rural areas for activities that are sometimes carried on in municipalities
and classified and billed as non-residential service shall likewise be
classified as general service in rural areas.
   (K)   Power service rate classification. 
      (1)   This schedule is applicable to any consumer whose requirements
comply with the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable power service
rate schedule and who contracts in writing for such service.
      (2)   The power rate is only available on a 12-month year round basis and
seasonal disconnects will not avoid the applicable contract monthly minimum
charge specified in the rate schedule. The utility reserves the right to
require the consumer to install the necessary complete substation, in which
event, the specified substation ownership discount shall apply.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.071 ELECTRIC RATES.
   (A)   General service.
      (1)   Availability. 
         (a)   This division is available and applicable throughout village's
(hereinafter referred to as Utility) entire service area for all single and/or
three-phase nonresidential service not specified in or for which Utility's
residential service Schedule R is not applicable. It also applies to
residential service where the installed or allocated nameplate rated
transformer capacity exceeds 25 kVa.
         (b)   This division applies to all three-phase service, whether
residential or nonresidential.
         (c)   This division, being Schedule GS, is applicable to all service
furnished to retail or wholesale businesses, manufacturing or processing
establishments, hotels, motels, mobile homes, trailer camps, stores,
restaurants, service stations, professional offices, theaters, amusements,
offices, schools, churches, clubs, lodges, multiple dwelling units, apartment
houses, public buildings, and the like and all other service that is not
strictly individual residential or home use in character.
         (d)   For new loads, Utility reserves the right to limit the
availability of this schedule to a maximum load of 150 kVa. See division (A)(8)
"Other Terms and Conditions" that follows.
         (e)   All service under Schedule GS is subject to the provisions of
this schedule and Utility's general rules and regulations or subsequent
revisions thereof, as if fully written herein.
      (2)   Net rate per month or part thereof per service.
         (a)   Charges.
 
Service charge   Single-phase       $15.00 per month
                Three-phase        $25.00 per month
Energy charge :  First 10,000 kWh @ $0.12 per kWh
                Over 10,000 kWh @  $0.09 per kWh
Capacity charge: First 50 kW @      No charge
                Over 50 kW @       $6.00 per kW
 
         (b)   All billings are subject to the provisions relating to:
determination of billing capacity, monthly minimum charge, purchased power cost
adjustment and other provisions hereinafter set forth.
         (c)   For billing where combined single and three- phase service is
furnished, see divisions (A)(8)(c) through (e) of this division.
      (3)   Determination of billing capacity.
         (a)   The billing capacity shall be the highest measured 15-minute
integrated or equivalent thermal kW capacity determined to the nearest kW by
means of suitable metering equipment. However, the billing capacity shall be
not less than the minimum billing capacity specified in consumer's contract
with Utility.
         (b)   Utility reserves the right at any time to install capacity
metering equipment. Utility will normally install capacity metering equipment
when consumer's usage in any month exceeds 10,000 kWh.
         (c)   Where capacity metering equipment is installed and the power
factor at time of maximum measured capacity is less than 90%, Utility reserves
the right to determine the billing capacity based on the measured kVa capacity
instead of kW capacity. Where capacity metering equipment is not installed, the
billing capacity may be estimated by Utility based on periodic tests or other
reasonable basis as determined by Utility.
         (d)   For highly fluctuating loads, such as welders, hoists, and the
like, the measured kW capacity shall be increased by an amount that is equal to
50% of any separately installed or allocated kVa of transformer capacity
required to supply such fluctuating loads.
      (4)   Monthly minimum charge per service. The monthly minimum charge
shall be not less than the highest minimum charge as determined by any of the
following methods:
         (a)   For single- phase service only: The monthly minimum charge shall
be the applicable service charge.
         (b)   For 3-phase, 3 or 4 wire service the monthly minimum charge
shall be $25.00 but not less than the minimum charge that may be specified by
contract with Utility. For 3-Phase service, the applicable monthly minimum
charge shall apply on a year around continuous 12 consecutive months basis or
longer as may be specified by contract. Therefore, any seasonal disconnection
of 3-phase service shall not avoid the applicable minimum charge, except under
(d) below.
         (c)   Where 3-phase service is furnished through a single 3- or 4-wire
service drop, in order to ascertain compliance with respect to the single and
3-phase minimum charges specified in (a) and (b) above, Utility reserves the
right to separately meter the single and 3-phase service and add the meter
readings together and calculate the bill as though served through a single
meter. However, the resultant combined total billing shall in no event be less
than the aggregate amount of what the billing would otherwise be, based on the
separate billing of the single phase metered service and its applicable minimum
charge specified under (a) above, PLUS the Applicable Minimum Charge for the
separately metered 3-phase service specified under (b) above.
         (d)   For service furnished to activities such as charitable,
philanthropic, non- profit community activities, (athletic fields, swimming
pools, parks, and the like), the monthly minimum charge shall be the applicable
monthly minimum charge as determined in (a) or (b) above. The applicable
monthly minimum charge shall apply to a minimum billing period of not less than
four consecutive months each time service is connected. For temporary service
furnished to fairs, carnivals and the like, consumer shall pay for all of the
"Up and Down" installation costs as specified in Utility's general rules and
regulations and the minimum billing period shall be not less than one month.
         (e)   For installations that are unusual character as to electric
usage requirements and/or investment, the monthly minimum charge and minimum
billing capacity will be determined by Utility and shall be set forth in the
service application or contract with consumer.
      (5)   Power supply cost adjustment. The rates and charges set forth in
this division are subject to increase or decrease in conformance to the
adjustment specified in Utility's Rider "A", set forth in §
50.057.
      (6)   Excise (kWh) tax adjustment. The rates and charges set forth in
this schedule shall be increased by an amount equal to the excise (kilowatt-
hour) tax imposed o the village's electric distribution system under R.C. §
5727.81. Said increase shall be automatically adjusted to reflect any change in
the kilowatt-hour tax imposed by R.C. § 5727.81.
      (7)   Terms of payment. The above rates and other applicable charges are
net as shown and already reflect the discount given from the gross rates if all
accounts due and payable are paid on or before the final payment date specified
on bill. If all accounts are not so paid, the gross rates are due and payable
which are 10% but not less than $2.00 higher than the foregoing net rates. If
any bill is not paid within 30 days after the payment date specified on bill,
service shall be subject to disconnection as provided in Utility's Rules and
Regulations. To partially compensate Utility for the additional expense
involved, any disconnection or reconnection of service shall be subject to
Utility's applicable trip charge.
      (8)   Other terms and conditions.
         (a)   Limitation of Schedule GS. When, in opinion of Utility the
system capacity required to adequately supply Consumer's existing and probable
future requirements, exceeds 150 kVa, Utility reserves the right to require
consumer to make the necessary complete substation installation. In such an
event, all service will be billed under Utility's Schedule LP, set forth in §§
50.050 through
50.059, and consumer shall receive the specified substation discount.
         (b)   Character of service.
            1.   For new installations, service will normally be supplied
through a single set of service wires with all service delivered to a single
meter location. Under such conditions a single bill will be rendered for
service.
            2.   The service voltage shall be specified by Utility. At
Utility's option it may be either 120/240 volt single-phase, 3 wire; 240 or 480
volt, 3-phase, 3 wire; or 120/208 or 277/480 volt 3-phase, 4 wire. If consumer
desires a voltage that is impractical for Utility to furnish, consumer shall
furnish at his expense the necessary transformers to deliver such voltage.
         (c)   Availability of 3-phase service. Normally only single-phase
service is available. Utility may, at its option, furnish 3-phase service if
such service is already available immediately adjacent to consumer's premises
and if it is practical and economical for Utility to furnish 3-phase service,
after giving consideration to the investment required and probable use of 3-
phase service by consumer; also providing consumer enters into an appropriate
contract covering the investment involved. The minimum charge and financing of
any 3-phase line extension shall conform to Utility's general Rules and
Regulations.
         (d)   Single billing if service is supplied through single service
drop. Where service is supplied through a single service drop either 3 or 4
wires extending to a single service entrance and meter location designated by
Utility, a single bill will be rendered, whether or not Utility elects to use
single or multiple metering.
         (e)   Multiple billing where service is supplied through multiple
service drops. Where service is delivered at different meter locations through
individual and separately metered single and 3-phase service drops a separate
bill will be rendered for each service drop location.
         (f)   Requirements to qualify for single billing. If consumer arranges
his wiring at his cost so that all requirements can be supplied by means of a
single 3 or 4 wire service drop extending to a single meter location designated
by Utility and providing that such service can be supplied from a single
transformer bank and metered through a single meter, a single bill will be
rendered for such service. In place of a single meter, Utility reserves the
right to use separate single and 3-phase meters in order to determine minimum
charge compliance as specified in division (A)(3)(c) under monthly minimum
charge per service.
         (g)   Metering voltage. Under the Schedule GS, Utility reserves the
right to meter consumer's requirements in the most practical manner either at
Utility's secondary or primary distribution voltage and in either case of the
billing kWh shall be the metered kWh.
         (h)   General service classification for billing purposes. In
determining consumer's classification for billing purposes, any establishment
carrying a business, professional, commercial or nonresidential telephone
directory listing shall automatically be classified as being nonresidential in
character and Schedule GS shall apply. However, the absence of such listing
shall not be the determining factor in establishing whether or not the service
utilization is nonresidential in character.
         (i)   Combined residential and nonresidential service. Where the
premises are used and occupied by a consumer for both residential and
nonresidential use as defined herein, all service shall be billed under
Schedule GS or at consumer's option the wiring may be separated (subject to
Utility's inspection and approval). In such an event each class of service will
be separately metered and billed under the applicable schedule.
         (j)   Definition of general service.
            1.   Service furnished outside of Utility's corporate limits shall
be considered general service in character where such service is not incidental
to residential use. Such service includes that used to prepare or process food
or other products to the extent that same are substantially in a form that they
can be used or can be readily adopted for use by, or for sale to the ultimate
consumer.
            2.   In addition, all electric service supplied outside Utility's
corporate limits for activities, purposes, or uses, that when carried on within
Utility's corporate limits would be classified as being nonresidential in
character and so billed, shall likewise be considered and defined as
nonresidential in character and Schedule GS shall apply. For the billing of
combined service, see preceding division (A)(8)(i).
         (k)   Three-phase service is required for unbalanced or fluctuating
loads. For highly fluctuating loads such as welders and electric melting
furnaces and/or unbalanced single phase loads, Utility reserves the right to
require consumer to operate such loads at 3-phase, with the loads balanced as
far as practical, substantially equal on each phase. As an alternate, Utility
reserves the right to require consumer to supply such fluctuating loads by
means of 3-phase motor-driven generator set.
         (l)   Motor specifications.
            1.   Single- phase service will not be furnished to operate
individual motors in excess of 15 HP rating, except where written permission is
granted by Utility.
            2.   All motors 10 HP and larger may, at Utility's option be
required to be equipped with reduced voltage starting equipment or other
devices, to avoid unnecessary voltage surges and fluctuations on Utility's
system.
            3.   Motors designed for full voltage "across the line" starting
may, at Utility's option be permitted to operate on Utility's system, provided
however that Utility has determined that such operation will not be detrimental
to service furnished others.
         (m)   New line extensions. All new line extensions or the furnishing
of additional capacity shall be subject to Utility's General Rules and
Regulations covering same.
         (n)   Temporary service. For temporary service the consumer shall pay
all charges specified in Utility's General Rules and Regulations, which include
all "Up and Down Costs" and the consumer shall make a suitable deposit to cover
all the costs involved.
         (o)   Other charges for special service. See Utility's General Rules
and Regulations as to charges for disconnection and reconnection of service and
for other special services.
         (p)   Use of service. Service under this division (A) shall not be
resold or shared with others.
   (B)   Residential service.
      (1)   Availability and applicability.

available and applicable throughout village's (hereinafter referred to as
Utility) entire service area for only single phase service supplied where no
more than 25 kVa of installed or allocated name plate rated transformer
capacity is required to serve what is ordinarily designated and recognized as
individual single-family homes, apartments, mobile homes, and other individual
single-family dwelling quarters, including incidental farm use.
         (b)   All service under this division (B) shall be single phase
delivered through a single set of service wires, the service location to be
designated by Utility. Where service is supplied through one meter to more than
one single-family dwelling unit, living quarters or apartment, see division (B)
(4)(c) Multiple Dwelling Units as to billing procedure.
         (c)   This division (B) is not applicable for service utilization that
is ordinarily considered by public utility operation as being nonresidential,
non-home, or non- farm use in character.
         (d)   Where the installed or allocated name plate rating of the
transformer capacity exceeds 25 kVa per consumer or where 3-phase service is
furnished, Utility's General Service Schedule GS, as set forth is division (A)
of this section, shall apply.
         (e)   Where electric service supplied for combined residential and
nonresidential use, the General Service Schedule GS in division (A) shall apply
or for all such single-metered service. However, at consumer's option and at
his expense, the wiring may be separated (subject to Utility's inspection and
approval) and each class of service separately metered and billed in
conformance to the applicable schedule.
         (f)   All applications for service shall be in accordance with the
provisions of Utility's standard application form and in accordance with the
provisions set forth in this Schedule and also in accordance with the Utility's
General Rules and Regulations or subsequent revisions thereof on file at the

Energy charge: First 1,000 kWh @ $ 0.11 per kWh
              Over 1,000 kWh @  0.09 per kWh
 
            2.   The above charges are subject to the minimum charges, power
supply cost adjustment and other adjustments that follow.
      (3)   Monthly minimum charge. The monthly minimum charge per consumer
shall be the sum of the foregoing charges but not less than service charge.
      (4)   Adjustments to apply to rates and minimum charges. The foregoing
rates and minimum charges shall be subject to increase or decrease to the
extent that the following provisions and adjustments hereinafter set forth are
applicable:
         (a)   Power supply cost adjustment. The rates and charges set forth in
this division (B) are subject to the adjustments set forth in Utility's Rider
A, as set forth in §
50.057, and same shall apply.
         (b)   Excise (kWh) tax adjustment. The rates and charges set forth in
this schedule shall be increased by an amount equal to the excise (kilowatt-
hour) tax imposed o the village's electric distribution system under R.C. §
5727.81. Said increase shall be automatically adjusted to reflect any change in
the kilowatt-hour tax imposed by R.C. § 5727.81.
         (c)   Multiple dwelling units. This division (B) is applicable where
not more than one dwelling unit, apartment, living quarters, mobile home or
activity is supplied through one meter. Where four or more living quarters or
dwelling units are served through one meter as of the effective date of this
Schedule and for future dwelling units that are not separately metered,
Utility's General Service Schedule GS, set forth in division (A), shall apply.
         (d)   Seasonal service.
            1.   Seasonal service shall be defined as service that is furnished
for normally less than 12 months to homes, cottages, mobile homes, farm labor
camps, cabins, wells, and the like. Such seasonal service will be furnished
only where consumer's premises are located immediately adjacent to Utility's
distribution facilities. Any line extension required will be subject to
Utility's regulations and requirements pertaining to same.
            2.   Such seasonal service shall continue for not less than six
consecutive months each time service is established. Utility's trip charge
shall apply each time that service is connected or disconnected. All such
service applications shall be in the name of the property owner, which shall
pay all bills.
      (5)   Terms of payment.
         (a)   The above rates and other applicable charges are net as shown
and already reflect the discount given from the gross rates if all accounts due
and payable are paid on or before the final payment date specified on bill. If
all accounts are not so paid, the gross rates shall be due and payable, which
are 10% but not less than $1.00 higher than the foregoing net rates.
         (b)   If any bill is not paid within 30 days after the payment date
specified on bill, service shall be subject to disconnection as provided in
utility's rules and regulations. To partially compensate Utility for the
additional expense involved, any disconnection or reconnection of service shall
be subject to Utility's applicable trip charge.
      (6)   Other terms and conditions.
         (a)   Application for service and responsibility for payment of bills.
Where the premises are occupied by a tenant, Utility reserves the right to
require that the application for service be in property owner's name, which
shall be responsible for the payment of all bills. In such an event the bill
may be mailed direct to the tenant, with a copy to the property owner. In
addition, the tenant may be required to make a suitable deposit to secure bill
payment. However, such deposit is for protection of the property owner and in
no manner will such deposit relieve property owner of his responsibility for
payment of all bills for the property involved.
         (b)   Application for temporary service. For temporary service,
Utility's General Rules and Regulations shall apply. Utility reserves the right
to require that applications for temporary service be in the name of the
property owner, which shall pay all electric service bills. Each time that
service is established, same shall be subject to the Utility's applicable
"Turn-On" and "Turn-Off" trip charge for such temporary service.
         (c)   Character of service furnished.
            1.   The type of service furnished under this Schedule shall be
single phase at a nominal potential of approximately 120/240 volts, 3-wire. At
sole option of Utility, 120 volts, 2 wire service may be furnished.
            2.   This division (B) is not applicable for 3-phase service. If 3-
phase service is supplied, Utility's General Service Schedule "GS" set forth in
Division (A) of this section shall apply to all service both single and 3-
phase.

(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.073 BILLING.
   (A)   All bills are due and payable when rendered on or before the date
specified on the consumer's bill for electric service. If all accounts of the
consumer are not so paid, the gross rates set forth in rate schedule are
payable.
   (B)   The utility will allow at least ten days between the date of bill and
the final payment date specified on the consumer's bill.
   (C)   Bills are payable in person or by mail at the main or branch offices
of the utility or at any authorized and designated collection agency of the
utility on or before the date or time limit specified on the bill. Failure to
receive bill or the existence of a consumer deposit will not entitle the
consumer to any discount or to the remission of any charge for non-payment
within the date of time limit specified.
   (D)   The word “month” or “regular billing period”, as used herein, are
hereby defined to be the elapsed time between two successive meter readings,
approximately 30 days apart.
   (E)   The utility may bill at other than monthly intervals, in which event
the length of the rate blocks and the applicable minimum and service charge
will be multiplied by the number of months between meter readings.
   (F)   In the event of meter stoppage or the failure of any meter to register
the full amount of current the consumer, the consumer will be billed for such
period on an estimated consumption based upon his or her use of current in the
similar period of like use.
   (G)   Consumers who intend to move from premises or discontinue the use of
electricity or in any way terminate their liability hereunder shall give the
utility reasonable notice of such intention. The consumer or property owner
will be liable in accordance with the laws of this state for all electricity
used upon the premises until such notice is given and the utility has or have
furnished the final meter reading and service has been disconnected.
   (H)   Budget billing for all electric homes: where the consumer's use of
electric service during a 12-month period is 12,000 kWh or more, the consumer
shall have the option of paying his or her bills monthly, in conformance to the
utility's budget plan, which is as follows:
      (1)   Based on actual experience (or estimated by the utility's heating
consultant where actual experience is not available), the 12 months determined
billing will be divided by 12 and the result shall be the “average monthly
budget bill.”
      (2)   Beginning September of each year, the consumer will receive ten
monthly budget bills which shall be paid in the regular manner. Any difference
between the amount paid under the budget plan and the billing based on actual
kWh used shall be adjusted as a charge or credit on the July and August bills.
      (3)   The budget amount is to be paid regularly each month and if any
monthly payments are not made, the utility may, at its option, remove the
account from the budget plan and thereafter bill, based on current monthly kWh
use basis, with all accounts brought up to date.
      (4)   The utility reserves the right to readjust the budget bill to
conform to actual experience.
   (I)   Annual billing for small accounts: for small single-phase or 120 or
120/240 volt accounts and where the 12 months total usage does not exceed 1,000
kWh, the utility reserves the right to bill such service as follows:
      (1)   The 12 months monthly minimum or service charge shall be paid in
advance by the consumer to the utility. Such deposit shall continue as long as
service is connected.
      (2)   The utility shall read the meter at the end of each six-month
period. For billing purposes, the service charge, minimum charge and the kWh
set forth in each rate block shall be multiplied by six. All billings shall be
subject to the power supply cost adjustment as specified in “Rider “A” - Power
Supply Cost Adjustment,” as set forth in §
50.057.
      (3)   The resultant six months billing shall be paid in the regular
manner so that, at all times, the amount specified in division (A) of this
section is on deposit with the utility.
   (J)   Billing for a partial month's service under residential and general
service rates: where either the initial billing period after service is first
established or the final billing period up to time of service discontinuance by
the consumer is less than the regular billing period of approximately 30 days,
the following billing procedure shall apply:
      (1)   Where the initial service period is five days or less of the
utility's regular billing period, the consumer's initial kWh usage will be
carried over into the next succeeding regular billing period at the same
location and shall be combined with and be considered as part of the first full
month's regular billing period.
      (2)   Where the initial service period is six days or longer and for all
final bills regardless of days of service, the bill shall be calculated in
accordance with the charges as set forth in the applicable rate schedule, with
no proration of service or minimum charges or rate blocks to be made.
   (K)   For partial month's service under all schedules where demand or
capacity charges are involved:
      (1)   Where the initial period of service is five days or less, the
entire billing will be combined and considered as part of-the next succeeding
billing period for the same location.
      (2)   Where the initial period of service is from six to 15 days
inclusive, the billing kW or kVar demand or capacity and resultant minimum or
other charged will be billed on a 50% pro-rated basis. However, all energy
charges shall be billed as actually specified in the rate schedule itself,
without any pro-ration of the rate blocks.
      (3)   Where the initial period of service is 16 days or more and, in all
cases, where a final bill is involved (irrespective of days of service), the
billing shall be as set forth in rate schedule with no proration of demand,
capacity, energy or minimum charges whatever.
   (L)   (1)   For service supplied direct to trailer courts, marinas or other
temporary or portable dwelling units, the service application shall be in the
property owner's name on whose land the mobile home, trailer or other portable
structure is located. At the property owner's written request, the utility may,
at its option, send bills to the attention of occupant, but this procedure
shall in no manner relieve the property owner of his or her responsibility for
payment of all bills. Permanent mobile home installations will be billed in the
same manner as other permanent dwelling units.
      (2)   In all cases, the utility shall determine if the mobile home is to
be classified as a permanent installation as defined in §
50.003(D). All mobile home units that do not meet the test of permanency shall
be considered as temporary service and so billed.
      (3)   Where each unit is individually metered, as provided for in §
50.003, the utility reserves the right to send all bills to the attention of
property owner or operator, but this procedure shall in no manner relieve the
property owner of his or her responsibility for the payment of all bills for
electric service used on the premises. In such an event, each individual unit
location shall be properly identified by the property owner or operator and
will be billed month under the applicable residential rate.
      (4)   In order to avoid frequent and unnecessary meter readings and
billings for mobile homes or trailer courts, the utility reserves the right to
read meters and bill each service location only once for each regular billing
period. In all cases, the property owner shall be responsible for payment of
all bills.
      (5)   All reconnections and disconnections of service shall be subject to
the utility's charge for special services as set forth in §
50.072.
   (M)   Consumers who intend to move from premises or discontinue the use of
electricity or in any way terminate their liability hereunder shall give the
utility reasonable notice of such intention. The consumer or property owner
will be liable in accordance with the laws of this state for all electricity
used upon the premises until such notice is given and the utility has or have
furnished the final meter reading and service has been disconnected.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85; Am. Ord. 8-93, passed 7-19-93)
§ 50.074 METERS ACCURACY AND BILLING ACCURACY.
   (A)   Meter accuracy. 
      (1)   When the accuracy of a meter is questioned, upon written request
from the consumer, the utility will test the meter by comparing with a standard
test meter. If the meter is found to be correct within plus or minus 2%, to
partially cover the expense to make such a test, the applicable charge
specified in §
50.072 shall be paid by the consumer to the utility. Prior to any test, the
utility reserves the right to require a deposit to cover the charge.
      (2)   If the meter being tested is found to be more than 2% slow or fast,
no charge shall be made for testing and the utility will adjust the bill in
proportion to the error (either fast or slow) for the period covered by the
bill in question and the date of installation of a new meter, but the
adjustment period shall not exceed 90 days.
   (B)   Billing accuracy. Billing errors that do not involve accuracy of the
meter itself, but which involves the billing of the current consumer of record,
will be corrected for the period as determined by the utility that the error
existed and was reflected in the billing of the current consumer. Such billing
error corrections shall not involve any adjustments for interest and will be
reflected by means of appropriate increase or decrease adjustments on the
future bills to be paid by the consumer over a period not to exceed 12 months.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.075 METER READING.
   (A)   At the option of the utility, all consumers receiving service under
the residential and general service shall individually read their meters, as
near as practical, on the date specified on the meter reading form furnished by
the utility. Such form may be set forth on the utility's monthly electric usage
statement.
   (B)   Should a meter reading not be received from the consumer, the utility
will use its best judgment to determine the estimated usage for that billing
period.
   (C)   Bills will be estimated for two readings and if a meter reading is not
received for the third month, the utility will read the meter and the consumer
shall pay the applicable charge to cover the additional expense involved.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.076 DEPOSITS AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BILLS.
   (A)   For all service furnished within the corporate limits of the
municipality, the current property owner of record of the land involved is
responsible for the payment of all electric bills, irrespective of who incurred
such unpaid bills or when such bills were incurred or who owned or occupied the
property at the time such bills were incurred.
   (B)   As authorized by Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, § 4 and R.C. §
743.04, any unpaid electric service bills may be assessed as a tax lien against
the property involved. In addition, the municipality may disconnect the
electric service until all bills for same have been paid in full.
   (C)   Further provisions as to deposits are as follows:
      (1)   The utility reserves the right to require a suitable deposit, as
specified in §
50.072, to secure the consumer's account before service is initially
established or reconnected.
      (2)   The utility reserves the right to waive the deposit where the
applicant for service is the bona fide occupant and legal owner of the premises
to be served with electricity.
      (3)   The utility reserves the right to require an additional deposit if
the consumer's past record of payment on accounts or electric power usage
indicates that such deposit is required to assure payment from himor her. Such
deposit includes but is not limited to past experience as to payment of bills,
disconnection for non-payment of bill, checks returned for insufficient funds
and increased electric power requirements.
      (4)   Application may be required to be in name of the property owner, as
provided in §
50.003. For tenant-occupied premises, any deposit required by the utility of
the property owner is only for the convenience and protection of the property
owner. Such deposit shall, in no manner whatever, relieve the legal property
owner of the responsibility and obligation to pay all bills for electric
service supplied to the premises involved.
      (5)   Deposits may be held for the term of service rendered by the
utility to the consumer or may, at option of the utility, be refunded if the
consumer's credit has been established to the satisfaction of the utility.
      (6)   No interest on deposits shall be accrued or paid.
      (7)   The utility shall have a reasonable time in which to read, remove
or disconnect the service or meters after receiving notice from the consumer.
The utility shall ascertain that all obligations of the consumer (including all
accounts due the utility by the consumer) have been settled in full prior to
the return of any deposits by the utility to the consumer. Upon discontinuance
of service, any remaining deposit in excess of any indebtedness owed the
utility shall be refunded to the consumer.
      (8)   Deposits made by the consumer to secure payment of bills shall in
no way affect the terms of payment of the applicable rate schedule and all
bills must be paid within the stated time limit in order for the net rates set
forth in the schedule to be applicable.
      (9)   Deposits made as an aid-of-construction to partially pay for new
line extension costs or to establish temporary service or to pay for special
services as specified in §
50.072 shall in no manner be considered as a payment or prepayment of any bill
for electric service or to secure payment of same.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.077 APPLICABLE RATES AND SELECTION.
   (A)   Complete schedules of all rates in effect, including these rules and
regulations, shall be available to any consumer at all times at the utility's
office during regular office hours.
   (B)   The rates to be charged the consumer and to be paid by the consumer to
the utility for electric service shall be the applicable rates in effect by the
utility for the class of service involved.
   (C)   All changes in rates made by the utility shall be applicable with the
first regular billing period following the date that such rate changes are to
become effective, or as may be specified on the rate schedule itself.
   (D)   The utility assumes no responsibility for selection of most
advantageous rate schedule for a new consumer. However, the utility will, at
the consumer's request, assist in determining which of the utility's rates (for
which the consumer qualifies) would be most advantageous to the consumer when
computed on a 12-month basis, based on the following:
      (1)   Where a new consumer is involved, the most advantageous rate
determination shall be based on the 12-month load conditions as furnished by
the consumer to the utility.
      (2)   Where an existing consumer is involved, the most advantageous rate
determination shall be based on actual load conditions of the consumer as
recorded by the utility during a recent 12-month period elected by the consumer
as being normal.
      (3)   If additional load is to be added to the consumer's existing load
requirements, in the determination of the most advantageous rate, the
additional load requirements to be used to determine electric power cost shall
be those furnished by the consumer to the utility.
      (4)   The final rate selection shall be requested in writing by the
consumer.
      (5)   The rate selected by the consumer shall remain in effect for 12
consecutive months. After 12 months, the consumer shall be eligible to apply
for another rate.
      (6)   Any rate selection shall not apply retroactively to previous bills
of the consumer.
   (E)   The utility shall not be responsible to notify the consumer as to
availability of a more advantageous rate. Due to the impracticability of the
utility monitoring the variations in the load requirements of each and every
one of its consumers, the utility shall not be held responsible to notify the
consumer that, due to his or her changed load conditions, a more favorable rate
schedule is available. Therefore, the utility cannot guarantee that the
consumer will, at all times, be served under the most advantageous rate
schedule.
   (F)   The applicable rate schedule shall be specified in contract. Where a
written contract is involved, the rate specified in the contract, including the
service and minimum charge and related matters, shall apply, including any
revisions thereof. The rate is not subject to change except at the option of
the utility.
   (G)   To be eligible for a given rate schedule, the consumer's requirements
as to capacity requirements and utilization of electric service, including
control, wiring and equipment, shall conform to the rate schedule under
consideration.
   (H)   Any wiring or equipment changes required in order for the consumer to
qualify for a given rate schedule shall be made at the expense of the consumer.
   (I)   Conflict between rules and rate schedules: if a conflict occurs
between any provision set forth in these rules and regulations and the service
agreement or contract with the consumer or the applicable rate schedule, the
provisions set forth in the service agreement or contract shall take precedence
and govern, followed by provisions of the rate schedule and these general rules
and regulations.
(Ord. 10-85, passed 10-7-85)
§ 50.078 ADJUSTMENTS IN ELECTRIC UTILITY OVER BILLING OR UNDER BILLING.
   (A)   If a customer has been overcharged for electric service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, overcharges will be
refunded to the customer for the entire period of inaccurate billing, if that
period is discernible by the municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing
is not discernible, overcharges will be calculated based on a time period that
is the shortest of the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the
date of installation of the faulty meter or implementation of the error
resulting in the overcharge (if applicable), or 365 days.
   (B)   If a customer has been undercharged for electric service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, undercharges will be
billed to the customer, and the customer shall pay the charges for the entire
period of inaccurate billing, if that period is discernible by the
municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing is not discernible,
undercharges will be calculated based on a time period that is the shortest of
the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the date of installation
of the faulty meter or implementation of the error resulting in the undercharge
(if applicable), or 365 days. Undercharges billed to residential customers
shall in no event exceed a period of 365 days. Customers shall have the option
to pay the amount undercharged in equal payments spread over the same number of
months as the charges were accumulated.
   (C)   This section does not serve as a limitation to billing for
undercharges which are the result of tampering with utility equipment or theft
of utility service, or where a physical act of a customer or its agent causes
inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or inaccurate or no
measurement of the electricity rendered.

(Ord. 678, passed 9-7-76)
§ 52.28 EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGES FOR USER CHARGES AND DEBT SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   In addition to the base user charges and debt service charges
applicable pursuant to §
52.26 and §
52.27, users discharging pollutants to the wastewater treatment works of the
village, whose average concentration, as defined in §
52.22, in one or more classifications exceeds in any month that concentration
defined as normal in §
52.22 for the corresponding classification, shall be subject to surcharges
calculated as follows:
      (1)   Surcharges for each billing month during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following values for that calendar year: (1) estimated total
operation and maintenance expenses pursuant to §
52.26 - C to; (2) total debt service payments pursuant to §
52.27 - Ctd; (3) estimated total pounds of BOD received at the plant - Bt; and
(4) estimated total pounds of suspended solids received at the plant - St. Data
not available shall be estimated in the most practicable manner possible.
      (2)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of BOD in excess of normal
equals:
   [C to x 0.263] ÷ Bt
      (3)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of suspended solids in excess
of normal equals:
   [C to x 0.301] ÷ St 
      (4)   Surcharge on debt service charges per pound of BOD in excess of
normal equals:
   [C td x 0.263] ÷ Bt 
      (5)   Surcharge on debt service charges per pound of suspended solids in
excess of normal equals:
   [C td x 0.160] ÷ St 
      (6)   Pounds of BOD per billing period subject to surcharge equals:
(average concentration of BOD, calculated pursuant to §
52.22, in milligrams per liter minus 200 milligrams per liter) times (volume of
wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works per
billing period, in 1,000 gallons) times 0.00834. If average concentration of
BOD is 200 milligrams per liter or less, no surcharge for BOD shall apply.
      (7)   Pounds of suspended solids per billing period subject to surcharge
equals: (average concentration of suspended solids, calculated pursuant to §
52.22, in milligrams per liter minus 240 milligrams per liter) times (volume of
wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works per
billing period, in 1,000 gallons) times 0.00834. If average concentration of
suspended solids is 240 milligrams per liter or less, no surcharge for
suspended solids shall apply.
      (8)   Surcharge on user charges equals {'{'}[pounds of BOD calculated
pursuant to division (A)(6)] times [surcharge per pound calculated pursuant to
division (A)(2)]{'}'} plus {'{'}[pounds of suspended solids calculated pursuant
to division (A)(7)] times [surcharge per pound calculated pursuant to division
(A)(3)]{'}'}.
      (9)   Surcharge on debt service charges equals {'{'}[pounds of BOD
calculated pursuant to division (A)(6)] times [surcharge per pound calculated
pursuant to division (A)(4)]{'}'} plus {'{'}[pounds of suspended solids
calculated pursuant to division (A)(7)] times [surcharge per pound calculated
pursuant to division (A)(5)]{'}'}.
       (10)   Formulas as contained in divisions (A)(2), (3), (4) and (5) shall
be subject to adjustment as necessary, based upon annual audit of sewer revenue
fund expenses.
   (B)   Surcharges may also be established for pollutants other than those
provided for in this section which are permitted to be discharged to the
wastewater treatment works by the village, after pretreatment or without
pretreatment.
   (C)   Surcharges levied pursuant to this section shall be billed monthly or
as otherwise established by the Village Administrator. The rates shall be as
pursuant to §
52.30.
(Ord. 678, passed 9-7-76)
§ 52.29 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY SURCHARGES.
   (A)   In addition to the applicable base user charges and debt service
charges pursuant to §§
52.26 and
52.27, and in addition to any applicable surcharge for wastes in excess of
normal pursuant to §
52.28, all users in the Industrial User Class shall be levied an industrial
cost recovery (ICR) surcharge in order that their proportionate share of the
federal grant for the wastewater treatment plant improvements (Federal Project
#C390589) will be recovered. All users in the Non-Industrial User Class shall
be exempt from the surcharges required in this section.
   (B)   The ICR surcharges shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Surcharges for flow for each billing period during a calendar year
shall be based upon the design average flow for the wastewater treatment plant
expressed in 1,000 gallons per day:
Design average flow equals 735,000 gallons per day
   Q d = 735
      (2)   The ICR surcharge per 1,000 gallons of industrial wastes discharged
by each industry subject to the grant recovery surcharges equals the following,
where the grant amount shall be determined by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency for project #C390589:
   (Grant Amount ÷ 30) ÷ (Q d x 365)
      (3)   The ICR surcharges for each billing period for industrial wastes
having biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids concentrations above the
normal pursuant to §
52.22 shall be based upon the design BOD and suspended solids loading for the
wastewater treatment plant, expressed in pounds per day: design BOD loading
equals 1,695 pounds per day - B d; design suspended solids loading equals 1,130
pounds per day - Sd.
      (4)   The ICR surcharge per pound of BOD in excess of normal equals:
   [0.263 x (Grant Amount ÷ 30)] ÷ [B d x 365]
      (5)   The ICR surcharge per pound of suspended solids in excess of normal
equals:
   [0.160 x (Grant Amount ÷ 30)] ÷ [Bd x 365]
      (6)   Pounds of BOD per billing period subject to ICR surcharge shall be
calculated pursuant to §
52.28(A)(6).
      (7)   Pounds of suspended solids per billing period subject to ICR
surcharge shall be calculated pursuant to §
52.28(A)(7).
      (8)   The grant recovery provisions of this section shall remain in
effect for a period of 30 years commencing on the date on which this subchapter
takes effect.
      (9)   The ICR surcharge revenues collected by the village shall be
distributed as follows:
         (a)   50% of the ICR surcharges and any interest earned thereon shall
be reimbursed to the United States Treasury annually in accordance with United
States Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
         (b)   40% of the ICR surcharges shall be retained by the village and
may be used only for purposes of expansion and reconstruction of the wastewater
treatment works. Written permission must be obtained from the Regional Director
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency before expenditures from
these retained amounts can be made. Pending use, the village shall invest the
retained amounts for reconstruction and expansion in accordance with the rules
and regulations established by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency.
         (c)   10% of the ICR surcharges may be utilized by the village as
deemed proper by the Village Administrator. There are no United States
Environmental Protection Agency restrictions on how this portion of the ICR
revenues can be expended.
       (10)   Formulas as contained in divisions (B)(4) and (5) shall be
subject to adjustment as necessary, based upon an annual audit and review of
the ICR surcharges.
   (C)   Surcharges levied pursuant to this section shall be billed annually or
as otherwise established by the Village Administrator. The rates shall be as
pursuant to §
52.30.
   (D)   Within the limitations of all applicable federal, state and local
laws, the United States Environmental Protection Agency shall have the right to
audit industrial waste discharge records.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 52.50 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The sewer system of the village, including all existing and future
sanitary and combined sewers, is hereby determined to be a public utility.
   (B)   It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to
the protection of the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the
village to levy and collect charges or rentals upon all lots, lands, and
premises served by having connections with the sanitary and combined sewage
system and the pumping, treatment, and disposal works of the village to be used
as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 474, passed 7-20-54)
§ 52.51 DEFINITION.

(Ord. 474, passed 7-20-54)
§ 52.52 SEWAGE SERVICE CHARGE OR RENTAL ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   For the purposes as provided in this subchapter, there is hereby
levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having
any sewer connection with the sanitary or combined sewage system of the
village, or otherwise discharging sewage, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly, into the village sewage system, a sewage service charge
or rental, payable as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   Such sewage service charge or rental shall be in the amount
determinable as follows:
      (1)   For any lot, tract, parcel of land, premises or building situated
within or outside of the village limits and having any connection with the
village sewage system, or having any connection with the village sewage
available thereto, or otherwise discharging sanitary sewage, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the village sewage system, a
charge or rental shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or
therein, as the same is measured by the existing village water meters in use,
or if not a water user supplied by the Department of Water, or only a partial
user thereof, the amount of water used therein shall be metered or otherwise
measured or determined by the Village Administrator, or the owner or other
interested party, at his or her expense, may install and maintain a meter
acceptable to the Village Administrator for such purposes. Charges for
industrial wastes shall be determined in accordance with §§
52.20 et seq.
      (2)   Such charges or rentals shall be based upon the water used per
month. Pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, the Village Council shall
establish necessary charges or rental fees. Such charges or rental fees, as may
be revised from time to time, shall be available in the office of the Village
Administrator. Effective with utility bills rendered on or about January 1,
2020, the sewer charges inside the corporate limits are $14.00 per 1,000
gallons, with $28.00 being the minimum charge for the first 2,000 gallons of
water used per month, and the sewer charges outside the corporate limits are
$18.20 per 1,000 gallons, with $36.40 being the minimum charge for the first
2,000 gallons of water used per month. Effective with utility bills rendered on
or about January 1, 2021, the sewer charges inside the corporate limits are
$14.50 per 1,000 gallons, with $29.00 being the minimum charge for the first
2,000 gallons of water used per month, and the sewer charges outside the
corporate limits are $18.85 per 1,000 gallons, with $37.70 being the minimum
charge for the first 2,000 gallons of water used per month. Effective with
utility bills rendered on or about January 1, 2022, the sewer charges inside
the corporate limits are $15.00 per 1,000 gallons, with $30.00 being the
minimum charge for the first 2,000 gallons of water used per month, and the
sewer charges outside the corporate limits are $19.50 per 1,000 gallons, with
$39.00 being the minimum charge for the first 2,000 gallons of water used per
month.
      (3)   In the event the Village Administrator finds that it is not
practical to measure such wastes subject to the sewer rental as established in
division (B)(2) by meter, the Village Administrator may measure such wastes in
such other manner or method as the Village Administrator may find practical in
light of the conditions and attendant circumstances. In the event it is found
by the Village Administrator that such water or wastes metered or otherwise
measured is not actually the true measure of the volume of sewage, liquids or
waste being discharged into the village sewage system, the Village
Administrator may modify and adjust such charges in accordance with the facts
and justice and equity according to the rates as established in division (B)
(2).
      (4)   In addition to the charge of rental determined according to the
rates established in division (B)(2), a further charge of 10% of such amount so
determined shall be added thereto in each case of failure to make prompt
payment and the total thus obtained shall be the sewage service charge or
rental in each such case. The time within which such payment shall be made in a
manner classified as a “prompt payment” shall be determined by the Village
Administrator, and shall be expressed through the rules and regulations which
are authorized by this subchapter to be made for the purposes hereof.
      (5)   The sewer service charge or rental established in division (B)(2)
shall be payable monthly at the office of the Village Administrator, and at the
option of the Village Administrator, may be made payable at the same time as
water bills.
   (C)   For any lot, land, building, or premises from which a connection is
made with the village sanitary and combined sewage systems, or having such
connection available thereto, or which begins to discharge sewage, water or any
other liquids into the village sanitary and combined sewage system, either
directly or indirectly, after this section becomes effective, a charge shall be
made pursuant to this subchapter, such charge to be a per diem or pro-rata
amount based upon the charge which would apply for the entire month, and
computed according to the rates as established in divisions (B)(2) and (B)(3).
The charge made on this basis shall apply from the time such sewer connection
is made or becomes available, or such discharge into the village sewage system,
either directly or indirectly, is begun, until the next following monthly
period.
   (D)   The charges charge or rental levied and assessed by this section shall
be payable in monthly payments in each year as provided in divisions (B)(2) and
(B)(3).
   (E)   Equivalency factors. The following equivalency factors are based upon
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency guide and are computed on the basis of
the probable demand a user places on a public water system. The probable flow
rate demand is correlated to the demand expected by a single family dwelling by
the use of equivalency factors shown below. The minimum equivalency factor that
shall be met is one (1) when computing fees and charges (unless one (1) E.D.U.
already exists on the property). Equivalency factors for types of users not
listed must be determined by Village's Engineer on an individual basis.

§ 52.56 DISCONNECTION FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   (A)   It is the policy of the village to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The village's form for application
for utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title,
address, room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of
billing, clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
      (1)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth
on the bill; and
      (2)   That if any bill is not paid on or before that date, a second bill
will be mailed containing a cut- off notice that if the bill is not paid within
ten days of the original payment due date, service will be discontinued for
nonpayment; and
      (3)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the
village official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be
authorized to order that the customer's service not be discontinued and shall
have the authority to make a final determination of the customer's complaint.
   (B)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained; only
questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence of
payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least ten days.
   (C)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge to be established by the Village Council.
(Am. Ord. 15-2011, passed 1-17-12)
§ 52.57 ADJUSTMENTS IN SEWER SERVICE OVER BILLING OR UNDER BILLING.
   (A)   If a customer has been overcharged for sewer service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, overcharges will be
refunded to the customer for the entire period of inaccurate billing, if that
period is discernible by the municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing
is not discernible, overcharges will be calculated based on a time period that
is the shortest of the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the
date of installation of the faulty meter or implementation of the error
resulting in the overcharge (if applicable), or 365 days.
   (B)   If a customer has been undercharged for sewer service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, undercharges will be
billed to the customer, and the customer shall pay the charges for the entire
period of inaccurate billing, if that period is discernible by the
municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing is not discernible,
undercharges will be calculated based on a time period that is the shortest of
the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the date of installation
of the faulty meter or implementation of the error resulting in the undercharge
(if applicable), or 365 days. Undercharges billed to residential customers
shall in no event exceed a period of 365 days. Customers shall have the option
to pay the amount undercharged in equal payments spread over the same number of
months as the charges were accumulated.
   (C)   This section does not serve as a limitation to billing for
undercharges which are the result of tampering with utility equipment or theft
of utility service, or where a physical act of a customer of its agent causes
inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or inaccurate or no
measurement of the water rendered.
(Ord. 7-2017, passed 8-7-17)
§ 52.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter for which
no other penalty has been provided shall be punished as provided in §
10.99.
   (B)   Whoever violates the provisions of §
52.01 shall be fined as provided in §

52.06 shall be fined as provided in §
10.99 for each violation. Each day in which any such violation shall continue

separate offense.
(Ord. 592, passed 8-19-69)
   (D)   Violations of §§
52.20 through

52.20 through
52.35 shall be found, a written notice, stating the nature of the violation,
shall be sent by first class mail to the person apparently guilty of the
violation. This notice shall be deemed sufficient, in the event of violation,
if sent to the address of that person as shown on water account records. The
notice shall, in all cases, set forth a time limit during which all noted
violation shall cease and be abated, and appropriate corrective action taken,
and if the violator shall not thus comply, the provisions of the following
paragraph shall then apply.
      (2)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in division (D)(1) of this section shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to the penalty
prescribed by §
10.99. Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a
separate offense.
      (3)   Any person violating any of the provisions of §§
52.20 through
52.35 shall become liable to the village for any expense, loss or damage
occasioned the village by reason of such violation, notwithstanding whether the
person may have been prosecuted for a violation of the terms of §§
52.20 through
52.35.
      (4)   Any person violating state or federal regulations as a consequence
of violating any provisions of §§
52.20 through

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.001 RULES AND REGULATIONS GENERALLY.
   (A)   These general rules and regulations of the village covers the supply
of water service to water consumers of the village and are hereby adopted by
the Village Administrator. The rules and regulations are applicable for the
furnishing and utilization of water service supplied to village's consumers,
located within and without the village's corporate limits.
   (B)   When used hereafter, the words “village,” “municipality,” “utility,”
“Village Administrator” and “Water Department” shall also be considered to be
the same as being the Water Department of the village and/or the Village
Administrator, who is responsible under the laws of the state to manage same.
   (C)   As hereinafter used, the words “consumer,” “applicant” or “property
owner” shall be construed to be any individual, firm, organization or
corporation using village's water service and all of the general rules and
regulations set forth herein are applicable to all water consumers of the
village as well as to all employees of village's water system.
   (D)   These rules and regulations are supplementary and a part of village's
water rate schedules and are intended to set forth rights and obligations of
the village and its Water Department as well as those of the consumer or
property owner with respect to the supply and use of water service together
with other matters related to same.
   (E)   It shall be the responsibility of the Village Administrator and/or the
Village Clerk-Treasurer to enforce these general rules and regulations, and
where the words “village” or “utility” are hereafter used, it shall also be
construed to mean the Village Administrator and/or the Village Clerk-Treasurer.
   (F)   The Village Clerk-Treasurer and Village Administrator are, to the
extent necessary, hereby authorized to prepare such supplementary
administrative rules, forms and specifications as may be necessary to properly
enforce and carry out the intent of these general rules and regulations.
   (G)   Any additions or revisions to these general rules and regulations
shall be made by means of amendments authorized by the Village Administrator.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.002 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE INSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.
   (A)   (1)   Application for water service shall be made in writing on the
Utility's Standard Form available at Utility's Water Department office.
      (2)   There shall be set forth on the application the class of service to
be furnished, such as residential or non-residential as defined in the
applicable rate schedule.
   (B)   (1)   All applications involving an “original” or “new service line”
connection or installation shall be made by and only in the name of the
property owner. By such application the property owner shall be deemed to
assent, agree and commit himself or herself to all rules and regulations and
charges relating to the furnishing and utilization of water service.
      (2)   Such application for service shall state that the property owner
will be responsible for the payment of all bills for water service used on the
premises involved and for any damage to the utility's meter, equipment or other
facilities caused by the property owner's or consumer's negligence.
      (3)   Subsequent applications for water service involving a tenant shall
also be made by the property owner. For the convenience of the property owner,
all bills will be billed in the property owner's name but shall be mailed to
the address of the premise being served, attention of the tenant. However, such
billing procedure shall in no way relieve the property owner from being
responsible at all times for all water used on the premises involved.
      (4)   Where the “consumer” is hereafter used in these rules and
regulations, such term shall be considered as being the same as “property
owner.”
      (5)   See also §§
53.085 through
53.087 for billing and deposit regulations.
   (C)   (1)   There shall be set forth on the application the location of the
premises to be served: whether inside or outside the corporate limits of the
municipality, the class of service (whether residential or non-residential),
and the applicable rate that shall apply.
      (2)   See §
53.014 as to requirements where the furnishing of service involves an extension
of the utility's water mains.
   (D)   For premises located outside the corporate limits, see §
53.003 as to the requirements and conditions under which the utility will
furnish service and its responsibility for continuation of service.
   (E)   (1)   The consumer shall advise the utility of the purpose for which
the water will be used and the probable quantity required in order that the
utility can properly determine the necessary size of the service line and meter
required to adequately serve the consumer. The size of service line and meter
required for any consumer shall be determined by the utility.
      (2)   The minimum and other charges shall be determined by the size of
the service line installation as set forth in the applicable rate schedule.
   (F)   Where the consumer's requirements for water service are unusual, the
utility reserves the right to require a suitable contract from the consumer for
a reasonable period of time so as to protect the utility's investments required
to render the service involved. See §
53.014, Line Extensions.
   (G)   (1)   All applications involving a new tap and service line shall,
before work is commenced, be accompanied by the tap charge, deposit and other
charges hereinafter specified to be paid for or advanced by the property owner
applicant, including such payments as may be specified if a line extension is
involved.
      (2)   See §
53.004, Tap and Service Line Installation and Charge.
   (H)   Equivalency factors. The following equivalency factors are based upon
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency guide and are computed on the basis of
the probably demand a user places on a public water system. The probably flow
rate demand is correlated to the demand expected by a single family dwelling by
the use of equivalency factors shown below. The minimum equivalency factor that
shall be met is one (1) when computing fees and charges (unless one (1) E.D.U.
already exists on the property). Equivalency factors for types of users not
listed must be determined by Village’s Engineer on an individual basis.

   FUTURE LOTS. The lots or premises immediately adjacent to the original
extension that will not be initially served upon completion of the extension
but which may be served in the future.
   ORIGINAL EXTENSION.
      (1)   The water main extension under consideration, which shall be set
forth on a suitable scale map, properly dimensioned, showing length of
extension, all lots together with front footages, ownership of lots and other
pertinent data.
      (2)   Any future extension of the original extension shall be considered
as an entirely new and separate extension.
   ORIGINAL LOTS. The lots or premises to be served by the original extension.

§ 53.031 EXTENSION POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS.
   This policy covers all water service extensions and additions involving
either of the following:
   (A)   Extensions within the corporate limits of municipality. All of the
provisions set forth in this subchapter shall apply to all new extensions made
within the corporate limits of the municipality.
   (B)   Extensions outside the corporate limits of municipality. After the
effective date of this policy, no extensions or water taps beyond the corporate
limits of the municipality will be made unless all of the requirements set
forth below are complied with in their entirety.
      (1)   All new extensions must be located immediately adjacent and
contiguous to the corporate limits of the municipality and directly connected
to the utility's then existing water system that is located within the then
existing corporate limits of the municipality.
      (2)   No extensions of the utility's water distribution system (including
new water taps) shall be made unless all of the area then being served or to be
served by the mains or distribution system has been previously annexed to the
municipality in the manner prescribed by law. Therefore, no extensions or new
water taps will be made unless same are located entirely within the corporate
limits and all of the water distribution facilities are owned by the
municipality as specified in division (B)(3) of this section. The area to be
annexed shall, as determined by the municipality, not result in any
objectionable irregularities in municipality's corporate limit boundary lines.
      (3)   No extensions of existing facilities, including new water taps,
will be made or permitted unless title and ownership of all water distribution
facilities plus adequate right of way easements have been, by means of proper
bill of sale, conveyed to the municipality. Therefore, no additional consumers
will be supplied with water service to be furnished by the utility unless total
ownership of all water distribution facilities has been previously conveyed to
the utility.
      (4)   (a)   For existing extensions financed by a developer and if the
original developer has not been properly reimbursed to recover his or her
unreimbursed original cost of the facilities to be conveyed to the utility, the
utility shall act as trustee and shall develop a fair and equitable plan
whereby the future consumers that are connected to the developer's system
within five years from the date that the original extension was first placed in
operation will pay an equitable connection charge to the utility.
         (b)   All of such connection charges received by the utility shall be
distributed to all the consumers being served by the extension so that the
amount ultimately paid by all water consumers by the end of the five years
period will be equal, after giving proper consideration to the capacity
requirements of each consumer.
         (c)   All connection charges shall be redistributed to the water
consumers being served by the extension so that at and time all consumers will
have contributed an equal amount of money, the total of which shall equal but
not exceed the actual original total cost of the project. No refunds will be
made after the aforementioned five-year period.
         (d)   The allocation of construction costs and connection charges to
be paid by consumers shall be such that the provisions hereinafter set forth
will be complied with.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 53.032 COST OF EXTENSIONS; PAYMENT.
   (A)   Generally. The cost of all extensions shall be paid by the consumers
to be served or benefitting property owners. For extensions and service inside
the corporate limits, the costs involved may be paid by means of connection
charge fees or by means of special assessments. For service outside the
corporate limits, the costs are to be paid in advance by the property owners
and covered by written agreement as hereinafter provided and with provision for
refunds so that all consumers served within the initial five-year period will
ultimately have contributed equal amounts of money to receive service, taking
into consideration the capacity requirements of each.
   (B)   Cost of all extensions to be paid by applicants. The total installed
cost of all extensions shall be paid for by the original lot owner applicants
who have requested the extension. The extension costs shall be determined by
the utility and shall be the total installed cost of all pipe, the excavation
and backfill, fittings, valves, other appurtenances, fire hydrants, labor,
engineering, insurance, truck expenses plus all other costs that utility
determines to be properly chargeable to the project. All applicants shall be

policy shall be part of same, shall be executed by the applicant and the
utility. The agreement, accompanied by a suitable map drawn to scale, shall
identify the subdivision and the lot numbers and dimensions of all original and
future lots to be served. The lots to be initially served by the extension
shall be known as original lots. The lots located immediately adjacent to the
extension and which can be served in future by means of a standard tap and
service line shall be identified and know as future lots.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.034 INSTALLATION OF EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Generally. At option of the utility, all or part of the extension may
be installed by either the utility or applicant. If installed by the applicant,
all work shall be done by a contractor who shall be approved by the utility and
all work shall conform to the utility's standards and shall be subject to the
following:
      (1)   If the applicant, by means of an approved contractor, installs any
portion of the work specified, there shall be furnished to the utility all of
the original paid bills, together with the applicant's sworn statement that all
bills for labor, material and other proper charges have been paid in full; also
suitable executed right-of-way easements shall be furnished to the utility.
      (2)   If the utility elects to install any portion of the work specified,
the applicant shall pay a cash deposit to the utility that is sufficient to
cover the utility's estimated cost of the work to be done. If the actual cost
of the utility's work is lower than the deposit, any excess deposit shall be
refunded to the applicant. Should any deposit deficiency exist, the applicant
shall pay same to the utility before water service is established.
      (3)   The sum of the above costs shall be considered as the original
extension cost as referred to hereinafter.
   (B)   Six-inch minimum water main size. The size, material and installation
of all water mains and appurtenances shall conform to the utility's standards.
The actual size (including material) of the water main to be installed shall be
specified by the utility, taking into consideration the area to be served,
probable future growth, fire protection service, and related matters. In no
event shall the size of water main be less than six inches nominal inside
diameter.
   (C)   Mains larger than normal size. In the event that the utility elects to
install pipe that is larger than that which would normally be installed to
serve the area involved, the utility shall pay the additional cost of the pipe
material only that is in excess of the size which would otherwise be installed.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.035 MAIN LINE TAPS AND SERVICE LINE TO METER.
   The utility shall, at the time of construction of the extension, require the
installation at the property owner's expense of all taps and service lines
needed to serve all existing original and future lots that can be directly
connected to the extension. The cost involved shall be included as part of the
foregoing main line extension costs and shall include the total cost of the
corporation cock, the service line that extends from the main to curb box and
the curb box and shut-off valve to be located near the property line.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.036 TAP AND METER INSTALLATION CHARGE.
   Each service shall be subject to the utility's regular tap, service and
meter installation charge, which shall be independent of and in addition to the
aforementioned original line extension cost and shall be paid by each applicant
before water service is established. Each tap and service shall also be subject
to the utility's system capacity connection charge when applicable.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.037 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.

utility such bill of sale and such right-of-way easements as the utility deems
necessary.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.039 OWNERSHIP OF WATER LINES.
   All water mains, service lines and appurtenances up to and including the
shut-off valve located near the property line of applicant shall be owned,
operated and maintained by the utility. The acceptance by the utility of
applicant's request (on the utility's application fee for service or line
extension) shall be considered as conveyance to the utility of all of the
applicant's interest to the water main extension and related items.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.040 ALLOCATION OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS.
   The owner of any future lots to be served shall, before service is
established, pay to the utility his or her proportionate share of the original
extension cost in accordance with the following provisions.
   (A)   The amount to be paid by the owner of the “future lot” shall be such
that when the payment made by the owner is divided equally and paid to all of
the then existing lot owner water consumers, all water consumers (including the
new applicant “future lot” owner) will have contributed an equal amount towards
the original water main extension cost, after giving proper consideration to
any differences that may exist as to the water main footage involved and the
size and capacity of the tap of any consumer. Therefore, at any one time, all
lot owners connected to the extension will have paid an equal amount towards
the cost of the extension, after proper adjustment has been made as to the
footage of water main capacity of the tap and service line requirements have
been properly evaluated.
   (B)   All applicant payments involving service to a future lot shall be paid
to the utility in cash before water service is established. The utility shall,
within 60 days from receipt of payment, make the refunds referred to in
division (A) of this section. All refunds will be made to the then owners of
record of the lots receiving water service on the date that refund is received
by the utility.
   (C)   After five years have elapsed from date service is first established
to any consumer, no additional payments towards the original extension cost
shall be required and therefore all refunds shall cease.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.041 EACH EXTENSION CONSIDERED AS NEW EXTENSION.
   The furnishing of water service to any lot other than those identified as
“original” or “future” lots in the agreement shall be considered as an entirely
new extension, to be treated accordingly. Thus, the foregoing refund policy
applies only to the consumers connected between the point of origin and the end
of the original extension. Any extension of water main beyond the end of the
extension main then being installed shall be considered as a new extension
having a new point of origin. Therefore, if an extension of the water main is
connected to a previous extension, no refund would be made to the consumers
connected to the original or previous extension. Refunds are to be made only
when consumers are directly connected to an extension between the point of
origin of the water main and the termination point of the new water main
extension.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.042 SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ALTERNATE FINANCING METHOD WITHIN CORPORATE LIMITS.
   The extension policy set forth herein is supplementary to and does not
preclude an alternate method of financing of water system extensions and
improvements to be made within the corporate limits by means of special
assessments as authorized by state law. All assessment petitions shall specify
that the property owner shall pay all costs, including street and alley
intersections.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.043 EXTENSIONS BEYOND EXISTING CORPORATE LIMITS AND ANNEXATION
REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   No water extensions will be made beyond the corporate limits of the
municipality as they exist at the time such an extension is being considered
unless they are involved beyond the corporate limits has been previously
annexed to the municipality.
   (B)   Before such annexation will be considered by the municipality, in
order that the area under consideration will not initially or ultimately become
a burden or have to be subsidized by the then existing property owners and
water consumers located within the then existing corporate limits, the area to
be annexed must conform to and comply with the following conditions and
requirements.
      (1)   The area will ultimately fit and conform to the municipality's
long-term plan of orderly expansion. To this end, a plat map must be submitted
to the municipality for its review and approval, setting forth the various
improvements to be made as hereinafter referred to.
      (2)   Every deed conveying every lot or tract of land within the area
under consideration shall contain a covenant (duly recorded) that specifies
zoning and building restrictions and requirements that conform to the zoning
and building code restrictions of the municipality.

improvements to be made must be such that no greater burden will be placed on
its citizens than would otherwise occur if such an area was already within the
corporate limits. All of the foregoing improvements shall be paid for by the
property owner in the area involved prior to annexation. All of the
improvements shall conform to the municipality's construction standards and
specifications.
      (4)   It will be efficient and practical for adequate services to be
furnished, such as police and fire protection, transportation, street lighting,
and the like.
      (5)   The extension is economically feasible not only considering the
extension itself, but as to its overall effect on the balance of the water
system both from an economic and practical operation point of view, after
giving proper consideration to the long-term plans and probable future growth
of the utility's water system.
      (6)   The extension under consideration can be connected to the existing
lines of the utility's water system without jeopardizing service to other
existing consumers and without the likelihood of subjecting the utility to make
in the near future a substantial investment in additional facilities elsewhere
in its system in order to adequately serve the extension under consideration.
      (7)   The cost of all water line extensions and companion other
facilities and appurtenances are to be paid for by the applicant as provided
elsewhere herein.
      (8)   All of the charges and other provisions contained in the utility's
general rules and regulations covering water service are complied with.
      (9)   In addition to water service, the plans and specifications for
separate storm and sanitary sewers and sewage facilities shall also be
submitted to the municipality for its approval. The plans shall, in general,
conform to the utility's standards and that it is practical and economically
feasible to connect and supply same from the municipality's then existing
sewage system without enlargement of same. Should such enlargement be
necessary, it will be contingent upon the execution of a special agreement to
finance same. All such sewer facilities shall be installed prior to annexation
acceptance by the municipality.
      (10)   In the event annexation of the area involved is delayed due to
legal or other causes beyond control of the applicants for water service, the
municipality reserves the right to furnish water service subject to the
following. The following generally applies but is not necessarily limited to
new multiple lots subdivisions or developments and to the extent applicable al
applies to requests for water service to individual lots.
         (a)   All of the requirements as to improvements and the like
previously set forth for the area involved have been complied with.
         (b)   The property owner of each premise to be served outside the
corporate limits shall, before water service is established, execute a covenant
to run with the deed (to be properly recorded) covering the property involved
stating that, upon demand by the utility and within ten days of the demand, the
property owner will sign a petition requesting that owner's property be annexed
to the municipality.
         (c)   In the event the property owner fails to execute the annexation
petition, the utility reserves the right to disconnect and to discontinue all
water service to the premises involved, after the utility has given three
months written notice to the property owner to that effect.

RATES AND CHARGES
§ 53.085 BILLING, METER TESTING, PAYMENT OF WATER BILLS, ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   All bills for water service shall, at the option of the utility, be
rendered either monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly as may be specified in the
utility's applicable rate. Bills are payable on or before the date specified on
bill and, if so paid, the net rates and charges set forth in the utility's
schedule shall apply. If not so paid, the gross rates set forth in the
applicable schedule shall apply. Failure to receive the bill will not entitle
the consumer to the net rates nor to the remission of any charge for nonpayment
within the time specified.
   (B)   In the event of the stoppage of or the failure of the water meter to
register the full amount of water consumed, the consumer will be billed for
such billing period on an estimated consumption basis which will be based upon
the consumer's normal use of water in a similar period during the time the
meter was registering correctly.
   (C)   If a question arises as to meter accuracy and the consumer requests
the utility to test the meter, the following procedure and charges applies:
      (1)   If the meter is found to be correct within 2%, the consumer shall
pay the applicable charge specified in §
53.089. This payment is to partially cover the costs involved to remove the
meter, bring it into the shop, test same and reinstalling the original or at
the utility's option a replacement meter.
      (2)   If the meter inaccuracy is found to be greater than 2%, the expense
of the test shall be borne by the utility. Where the meter inaccuracy is in
excess of 2%, the adjustment shall not cover a period of water usage that is in
excess of the regular billing period.
   (D)   All meter readings and billings shall be in the measured units
specified in the applicable rate schedule, either in 1,000's gallons or 100's
of cubic feet.
   (E)   For service involving a partial billing period where either the
initial billing period after service is first established or the final billing
period up to the time discontinuance of service by the consumer is less than
the regular billing period, the following billing procedure will apply:
      (1)   Where “system capacity charge” does not apply. 
         (a)    When service is initially established to the consumer and the
period of service involves 5 days or less of the utility's regular billing
period when billed monthly or 10 days when billed bi-monthly or 15 days when
billed quarterly, the consumer's initial usage will be carried over into the
next succeeding regular billing period at that location and shall be combined
with and be considered as part of same.
         (b)    For all other service furnished for a partial billing period of
more than 5 days when billed monthly or 10 days when billed bi-monthly or 15
days when billed quarterly, and all final bills irrespective of the number of
days of service, the bill shall be calculated in accordance with the rate
blocks and charges (including minimum charges) as set forth in the applicable
rate schedule and no proration of rate blocks or minimum charge shall be made.
      (2)   Where “system capacity charge” applies. For initial service where
the capacity charge as set forth in the schedule is applicable, the capacity
charge will be billed as follows:
         (a)   Where the initial period of service is 5 days or less when
billed monthly or 10 days when billed bi-monthly or 15 days when billed
quarterly, the capacity charge shall be combined and made a part of the
succeeding billing period at that location.
         (b)   Where the initial period of service is from 6 to 15 days
inclusive when billed monthly or 16 to 30 days when billed bi-monthly or more
than 30 days when billed quarterly, the capacity charge will be prorated and
billed on a 50% basis. The commodity charge shall in all cases be billed as is
actually set forth in the rate schedule with no proration rate blocks whatever.
         (c)   Where the initial period of service exceeds the corresponding
periods specified in division 2(b) above, or where a final bill is involved,
the billing shall be as set forth in the applicable rate schedule and no
proration of the capacity charge, rate blocks or minimum charges shall be made.
   (F)   A consumer who intends to move from the premises or discontinue the
use of water shall give the utility reasonable notice of such intention as
specified in §
53.086. The consumer or property owner shall be liable for all water used on
the premises until such notice is given and the utility has made the final
meter reading and determined the consumer's or property owner's liability as to
the payment of bills for water service furnished to final meter reading data.
   (G)   All water that passes through a meter shall be charged for, whether
used, wasted, stolen, or lost by leakage, at the standard water rate for the
consumer. Water charges may be adjusted for the following reasons:
      (1)   An inaccurate meter as set forth in §
53.085(C).
      (2)   An improper billing of the account.
      (3)   Any other adjustment required to correct proven inequities in
billing.
      (4)   When a property owner or village personnel discover a problem on
the customer's property, such as a service line break or leak, which causes
significant increase in water usage to the property, above the normal average
usage, and the problem was not caused by the negligent actions of the property
owner, the Village Administrator may, depending upon the specific documented
circumstances, charge the property owner for the water that passed through the
meter at the village's lowest user rate of the standard customer rate. The
lost, unused water shall be considered to be the amount of water passing
through the meter which is greater than the average use for any billing period
over the previous 12 months.
   (H)   The following procedures shall be used for appeal of the Village
Administrator's decision regarding the adjustment of the water billing amount:
      (1)   Rulings of the Village Administrator may be appealed in writing to
the Adjustment Committee. Notice of the appeal shall be delivered to the
Village Administrator no later than 30 days after the billing date unless good
cause is shown why the appeal should be considered after 30 days. The notice
shall include any and all documentation or written statements the appellant may
want considered by the Adjustment Committee.
      (2)   An Adjustment Committee shall be created within the village to
consider appeals of the Village Administrator's decision for adjustments to
water billings. The Adjustment Committee shall have the same members of Council
as the Village Property Maintenance Committee as set forth in §
93.40(E)(1). Other persons may be called on as needed, in order to provide
input that is necessary to resolve the matter at hand.
      (3)   The written request for an appeal from a customer shall be
considered by the Adjustment Committee which will investigate the matter before
it and consider all pertinent facts in reaching a conclusion of the matter. The
Adjustment Committee may consider the appeal on the written documents or, at
its discretion, hold a hearing on the appeal. The Adjustment Committed shall
answer the appeal in writing to the customer within 30 days.

§ 53.086 RESPONSIBILITY OF PAYMENT OF BILLS BY PROPERTY OWNER.
   (A)   For all service inside the corporate limits of the municipality, the
present property owner of record of the premises to which water service is
furnished shall be responsible for the payment of all water bills for such
service, irrespective of who incurred such unpaid bills or when such bills were
incurred or who owned or occupied the property at the time the bills were
incurred.
   (B)   For the convenience of the property owner or tenant, the utility will,
at the property owner's request, bill the tenant direct for the water service
used, but will require a suitable deposit as specified in §
53.087. In such an event all bills will be addressed to the property owner,
attention of the tenant, and mailed to the address of the premises being
served. Such billing and deposit shall in no way relieve the property owner of
being responsible for all bills for water used on his or her premises to the
extent that the aggregate amount of any such delinquent bills due exceeds the
deposit.
   (C)   As authorized by Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, § 4, all unpaid
water bills may be assessed and collected as a tax lien against the property
involved.
   (D)   All gross bills and other charges due for water service, if not paid
within 90 days after same are due and payable, shall become a lien upon the
premises being supplied with water service. Such a lien shall be certified to
the County Auditor at which time the lien shall vest and the Auditor who shall
place same on the tax duplicate of the county, together with the interest and
penalties allowed by state law and shall be collected in the same manner as
other taxes.
   (E)   After the certification to the County Auditor, the Village
Administrator is authorized to shut off water service to the premises until the
unpaid water service charges have been paid except as hereinafter provided. For
further details on disconnection for nonpayment, see §
52.56.
   (F)   Without, in any manner, affecting the certification of lien or the
property owner's liability, the Village Administrator may permit the
reestablishment of water service (when the same has been shut off as provided
herein) providing a suitable deposit is obtained as provided hereafter under §
53.087.
   (G)   Notwithstanding the foregoing responsibilities of the property owner,
if past payment of water bills at a service location has been unsatisfactory, a
deposit may be required to be made as provided in §
53.087.
(Ord. passed 5-1-80)
§ 53.087 DEPOSITS.
   (A)   At the request of the property owner and without, in any manner,
implied or otherwise relieving the property owner of any of his or her
responsibility for the payment of all bills for water service, the utility may
bill the tenant direct. In such an event, in order to secure the tenant's
account and to protect the property owner within reasonable limits, but
assuming no responsibility as to adequacy of financial protection, before
service is established, the utility may require the tenant to make a suitable
advance deposit, as specified in §
53.089.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the responsibility of the property owner for the
payment of water bills as specified in §
53.086, in the event that the consumer's or property owner's past record of
payment of accounts has been unsatisfactory or his or her water usage indicates
that additional deposits are required to properly secure his or her account,
the utility reserves the right to require an additional deposit.
   (C)   The utility shall have a reasonable time in which to read, remove or
disconnect the meters after receiving the notice from the consumer. The utility
shall then ascertain that all obligations of the consumer (including all
accounts due the utility by the consumer) have been settled in full prior to
the return by the utility any deposits of the consumers.
   (D)   Upon discontinuance of service, such deposit as may remain in excess
of any such indebtedness owed the utility will be refunded to the consumer.
Should any deficiency exist, the same shall be paid by the property owner as
provided elsewhere in this chapter.

   (C)   In addition to the rates set forth in divisions (A) and (B) above,
each month a Water Supply Cost Adjustment (WSCA) Charge shall be added to each
water customer's water bill. The WSCA Charge shall be determined by multiplying
the Water Supply Cost Adjustment Factor (WSCAF), as set forth below, by the
customer's water usage. The monthly WSCAF shall be determined by dividing (1)
the village's past 12 month's water supply costs, by (2) the thousands of
gallons (Mgal) of water sold during the most recent 12 months (excluding bulk
water sales), and then subtracting (3) the base cost of water supply included
in the village's base water rates of $2.03 per Mgal. If the rates charged by
the village's water supplier are modified, the water supply costs for the past
12 months set forth in (1) above shall be adjusted to reflect the new rates. If
the resultant WSCAF is less than $0.0000 per Mgal, the WSCAF applied to
customers' bills will be $0.0000 per Mgal.
   (D)   The rate for bulk water supplied through the village's designated
water filling station shall be $0.25 per 59.5 gallons.

§ 53.091 ADJUSTMENTS IN WATER SERVICE OVER BILLING OR UNDER BILLING.
   (A)   If a customer has been overcharged for water service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, overcharges will be
refunded to the customer for the entire period of inaccurate billing, if that
period is discernible by the municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing
is not discernible, overcharges will be calculated based on a time period that
is the shortest of the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the
date of installation of the faulty meter or implementation of the error
resulting in the overcharge (if applicable), or 365 days.
   (B)   If a customer has been undercharged for water service because of a
malfunction in the metering system or a billing error, undercharges will be
billed to the customer, and the customer shall pay the charges for the entire
period of inaccurate billing, if that period is discernible by the
municipality. If the period of inaccurate billing is not discernible,
undercharges will be calculated based on a time period that is the shortest of
the time elapsed since the customer's service began, the date of installation
of the faulty meter or implementation of the error resulting in the undercharge
(if applicable), or 365 days. Undercharges billed to residential customers
shall in no event exceed a period of 365 days. Customers shall have the option
to pay the amount undercharged in equal payments spread over the same number of
months as the charges were accumulated.
   (C)   This section does not serve as a limitation to billing for
undercharges which are the result of tampering with utility equipment or theft
of utility service, or where a physical act of a customer of its agent causes
inaccurate or no recording of the meter reading, or inaccurate or no
measurement of the water rendered.

Section
   
54.01   Stormwater Drainage Utility created; rates
   
54.02   Storm sewer tap installation charges
§ 54.01 STORMWATER DRAINAGE UTILITY CREATED; RATES.
   (A)   It is hereby declared to be in the best interest of the village to
form a structure and procedures designed to better manage stormwater and
provide for storm drainage improvements, recognizing that all real property
within the village will benefit from the installation of an adequate storm
drainage system, and that the cost of such a system should therefore be
assessed against such property.
   (B)   There is hereby established in the village a Stormwater Drainage
Utility, the village hereby declaring its intention to acquire, own, construct,
equip, operate, and maintain open drainageways, underground storm drains,
equipment and appurtenances necessary, useful, or convenient for a complete
stormwater drainage system, including the maintenance, extension, and
improvement of the present storm drainage system.
   (C)   The Village Administrator shall manage, conduct, and control the
Stormwater Drainage Utility, and is authorized to develop and adopt plans,
policies, and regulations necessary or desirable for the regulation and
operation of such utility.
   (D)   There is hereby levied and imposed upon all premises which have been
improved within the village just and equitable charges for storm drainage
service or subsequent service, maintenance, operation, and extension, and to
establish a Storm Drainage Fund for the foregoing purposes.
   (E)   Such charges shall be collected with the monthly water bill of water
users, billed with sanitary sewer for those connected to sewer alone, or billed
alone as a storm drainage charge for those users not connected to or not
charged for village water or sanitary sewer.
   (F)   Such charges shall be paid monthly by those liable therefor, and
placed in a Storm Drainage Fund to be used only for the purposes stated herein.
   (G)   It is hereby determined that property is furnished service in
proportion to the amount of the property's impervious surface. The basic unit
of service is 4,200 square feet of impervious surface applicable to all
conventionally developed residential properties. All other properties shall be
furnished service equivalent to multiples of basic service units of 4,200
square feet of impervious surface as calculated for individual properties by
the Village Administrator.
   (H)   Rates shall be set by action of the Village Council. In no year shall
the operating fund of the utility show a loss.
   (I)   The rate for residential properties, which is based on a unit of 4,200
square feet, shall be $19.00 per month of service effective with the utility
bills rendered on or about January 1, 2020, and $20.00 per month of service
beginning January 1, 2021. All other properties shall be billed at multiplies
of the basic service units of 4,200 square feet per month.
   (J)   The established rates may be reduced for a property, other than a
conventionally developed one or two family property, where approved runoff
control measures have been implemented. Review and analysis of these measures
shall be handled on an individual case basis by the Village Administrator. The
maximum rate reduction shall be 50% of the established rate. Any person
aggrieved by a decision of the Village Administrator under this section may
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Ottawa County, Ohio, pursuant to R.C.
Chapter 2506.
   (K)   The owner of any property subject to a charge provided herein shall
pay the same, when due, to the village. If any charges due hereunder are not
paid when due, the Village Solicitor shall collect them by actions at law in
the name of the village.

turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be

intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.

provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.    Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.    Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.

walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise

guilty to a violation of any provision of this code that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial

of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this code is
substantially similar.
(R.C. § 4510.05)

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about

person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

having obtained a driver's license.

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other penalties
provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s
operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.
(R.C. § 4510.111)
   (C)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person whose
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. § 4510.037 and

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)
§ 71.14 OPERATING MOTOR VEHICLE OR MOTORCYCLE WITHOUT VALID LICENSE.
   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4507 or a commercial
driver's license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
registrar of motor vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the registrar, upon a driver's or
commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
130.18, §
130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §
130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)
(7).

court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall
the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         (b)   A fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000;
         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this section;

enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court may fine the

within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.

   (E)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided by law
or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor's

driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
R.C. § 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from holding
a commercial driver's license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver's
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person whose

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

holster, harness, or article of clothing on the person’s body.
   (C)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (A) of this section, the officer shall do
both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (D)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of operating a
motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in divisions (D)(1)
to (D)(5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         (a)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(1)(b), (D)(1)(c), (D)(1)(d),
and (D)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of

         (b)   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, R.C. §
4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court shall
impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $250.
         (c)   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court
also may impose a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.
         (d)    Notwithstanding divisions (D)(1)(a) to (D)(1)(c) of this
section, if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation in a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with
R.C. § 4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law,
shall impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under division (D)(1)(a), (D)(1)(b), or (D)(1)(c) of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(D)(1)(a) of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (D)(1)(a) of this section and the assessment of points under division
(D)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed $500. A person who is issued a citation for a violation of

must appear in person in the proper court to answer the charge.
      (2)   In addition to and independent of any other penalty provided by
law, the court or mayor may impose upon an offender who violates this section a
class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7). When a

for a violation of division (A)(1)(a) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine
withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites or a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under R.C.
§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the

withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL
TECHNICIAN-INTERMEDIATE and EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN-PARAMEDIC have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (c), (d)
and (e) of this section or less than the applicable concentration of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified
for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this section, that fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution
for a violation of division (B) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.011, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (c) of this section,
NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration  established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. §

violation of division (A) or (B) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Subject to division (E)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (A)(1)(b),

section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those divisions, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
division that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         (a)   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (F)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical

may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.

same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (M)   All terms defined in R.C. § 4510.01 apply to this section. If the

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly

         COMMUNITY ADDICTION SERVICES PROVIDER. Has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5119.01.

      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if
arrested for a violation of §

73.012, R.C. § 4511.19, R.C. § 4511.194, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley in violation of a division,

enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which of
the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have

      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person's own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of § 73.01, § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.19,
R.C. § 4511.194, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall give
that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically stat the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is
not in the person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194, or any other substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle, streetcar,
or trackless trolley in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI
ordinance or for being in physical control of a stationary vehicle, streetcar,
or trackless trolley in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. or this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. or this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of§
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194, or any other substantially similar municipal
ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical
test or tests under this section, and who submits to the test or tests,
regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance that the test results indicate is present in the
person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person's being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle, streetcar, or
trackless trolley in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle, streetcar, or
trackless trolley in violation of §
73.012 or R.C. § 4511.194, regardless of whether the person's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or
is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the
person's initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be
held within five days of the persons' arrest or the issuance of the citation to
him or her, subject to any continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. §
4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that section.

vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

place of the parking infraction charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and
affirm the facts it contains. If the operator of the vehicle is present, the
officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator in a space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of the
vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word “owner” in the space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by

as if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator
of the vehicle at the time of the violation.

operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the agent
of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in R.C. § 4521.09.
   (D)   Except as provided in R.C. § 4521.09, when a parking ticket is issued
for a parking infraction and is served pursuant to this section, the operator
of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction for
which the ticket was issued and the owner of the vehicle involved in the
parking infraction, if different, are jointly liable for the parking infraction

ordinance, resolution, or regulation enacted by the local authority pursuant to
R.C. § 4521.02(A). Any owner of a vehicle who pays any fine or penalty imposed
for a parking infraction pursuant to this chapter may recover the amount paid
from the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction.

another without reference to the fence that may enclose the premises.
      (4)   The running at large of any animal specified in division (A)(1) of

property of the owner of the dog.
         (d)   If the dog is sold, given to another person, or dies, notify the

(B)(6) of this section that the veterinarian who is charged with the violation
obtained, prior to debarking or surgically silencing the dog, a written waiver
form that complies with division (B)(7) of this section and that attests that

initial certificate was obtained. If a certificate holder relocates to a new
county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (B)(9)
(c)2. of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.

(R.C. § 955.22)
   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, §
90.18(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to
the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog, and §
90.26 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.
(R.C. § 955.222)
   (D)   Penalty.

more than $100 on a first offense, and on each subsequent offense shall be
fined not less than $75 or more than $250 and may be imprisoned for not more
than 30 days.
         (b)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (D)(1)(a) of
this section, if the offender is guilty of a violation of division (B)(2) of
this section or a violation of division (B)(3) of this section that involves a
dog that is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may
order the offender to personally supervise the dog that the offender owns,
keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience training, or to
do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(E))
      (2)   (a)   Whoever commits a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the
first offense and of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on each subsequent
offense involving the same dog. Upon a person being convicted of or pleading
guilty to a third violation of division (B)(3) of this section involving the
same dog, the court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as
a dangerous dog.
         (b)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (D)(2)(a) of
this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(F))

offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both, and the court may order the offender to obtain
liability insurance pursuant to division (B)(5) of this section. The court, in
the alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a
licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at
the owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final
determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that
division and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or
restrained in accordance with division (B)(4) of this section or at the county
dog pound at the owner’s expense.

section that involves a vicious dog is guilty of one of the following:
            1.   A felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the
dog kills or seriously injures a person. Additionally, the court shall order

            2.   A misdemeanor of the first degree if the dog causes serious
injury to a person. Additionally, the court may order the vicious dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the
county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         (b)   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed
under division (D)(4)(a)2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that §
90.18(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to
the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog and that §
90.26 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part of
the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability insurance
required under division (B)(5)(a) of this section in an amount, exclusive of
interest and costs, that equals or exceeds $100,000. Until the court makes a
final determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of
division (B)(3) of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the

(B)(6)(c) of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog
shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions of division
(B)(4) of this section or at the county dog pound at the owner’s expense.
(R.C. § 955.99(L))
      (7)   Whoever violates division (B)(5)(a), (B)(5)(c), or (B)(5)(d) of
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(M))
      (8)   Whoever violates division (B)(9)(d) of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(N))

division (D)(3), (D)(4), or (D)(6) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was

affirmative defense that all of the following occurred:

or low-alcohol beverage presented a driver's or commercial driver's license or

implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of R.C. §§ 4301.22(A)(1)
or (2), 4301.63 to 4301.636, 4301.69, and 4301.691, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinances. For purposes of division (A)(3) of this section,
the Commission or trier of fact shall consider that reasonable reliance upon
the identification presented and the completed transaction scan may require a
permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder to exercise reasonable
diligence to determine, and that the use of a transaction scan device does not
excuse a permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder from
exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
      (1)   Whether a person to whom the permit holder or agent or employee of
a permit holder sells any beer or intoxicating liquor is 21 years of age or

is that of the card holder.

addition to the defense provided by R.C. § 4301.639, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinance.
   (D)   In any hearing before the Liquor Control Commission and in any
criminal action in which the affirmative defense provided by division (A) of
this section is raised, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a deputy registrar
who issued an identification card under R.C. §§ 4507.50 to 4507.52 shall be
permitted to submit certified copies of the records of that issuance in lieu of

shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the municipality or its agent
pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section, as directed by the Clerk of the
Legislative Authority in the certification of the total costs or in an
affidavit from the agent delivered to the County Auditor or County Treasurer.
The placement of the costs on the tax list and duplicate relates back to, and
is effective in priority, as of the date the costs were incurred, provided that
the municipal corporation or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this
section certifies the total costs within one year from the date the costs were
incurred.
         (b)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of
this section may commence a civil action to recover the total costs from the
owner.
      (3)   This division (A) applies to any action taken by the municipality,
or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section, pursuant to R.C. §
715.26, which authorizes the inspection, removal and repair of buildings, or
pursuant to the Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 3.
      (4)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this
section shall not certify to the County Auditor for placement upon the tax list
and duplicate the cost of any action that it takes under division (A)(2) of
this section if the action is taken on land that has been forfeited to the
state for delinquent taxes, unless the owner of record redeems the land.
      (5)   The municipality may enter into an agreement with a County Land
Reutilization Corporation organized under R.C. Chapter 1724 wherein the County
Land Reutilization Corporation agrees to act as the agent of the municipality
in connection with removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or
other structures, making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions, or
abating any nuisance, including high weeds, overgrown brush, and trash and
debris from vacant lots. The total costs of such actions may be collected by
the corporation pursuant to division (A)(2) of this section, and shall be paid
to the corporation if it paid or incurred such costs and has not been
reimbursed.
      (6)   In the case of the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation
that is the agent of the municipality, a notation shall be placed on the tax
list and duplicate showing the amount of the lien ascribed specifically to the
agent’s total costs. The agent has standing to pursue a separate cause of
action for money damages to satisfy the lien or pursue a foreclosure action in
a court of competent jurisdiction or with the Board of Revision to enforce the
lien without regard to occupancy. For purposes of a foreclosure proceeding by
the County Treasurer for delinquent taxes, this division does not affect the
lien priority as between a County Land Reutilization Corporation and the County
Treasurer, but the corporation’s lien is superior to the lien of any other
lienholder of the property. As to a direct action by a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien for the taxes, assessment, charges, costs,
penalties, and interest on the tax list and duplicate is in all cases superior
to the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation, whose lien for total
costs shall be next in priority as against all other interests, except as
provided in division (A)(7) of this section.
      (7)   A County Land Reutilization Corporation acting as an agent of the
municipality under an agreement under this division (A) may, with the County
Treasurer’s consent, petition the court or Board of Revision with jurisdiction
over an action undertaken under division (A)(6) of this section pleading that
the lien of the corporation, as agent, for the total costs shall be superior to
the lien for the taxes, assessments, charges, costs, penalties, and interest.
If the court or Board of Revision determines that the lien is for total costs
paid or incurred by the corporation as such an agent, and that subordinating
the lien for such taxes and other impositions to the lien of the corporation
promotes the expeditious abatement of public nuisances, the court or board may
order the lien for the taxes and other impositions to be subordinate to the
corporation’s lien. The court or board may not subordinate the lien for taxes
and other such impositions to any other liens.
(R.C. § 715.261)
   (B)   Injunction may be granted for failure to comply. No person shall
erect, alter, repair or maintain any residential building, office, mercantile
building, workshop or factory, including a public or private garage, or other
structure, within the municipality unless all ordinances or resolutions enacted
pursuant to R.C. §§ 715.26 through 715.30 are fully complied with. In the event
any building or structure is being erected, constructed, altered, repaired or
maintained in violation of such ordinances or resolutions, or there is imminent
threat of violation, the municipality or the owner of any contiguous or
neighboring property who would be especially damaged by such violation, in

through 163.22, any such building or structure and the real property of which

the building or structure is no longer a public nuisance, insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, unhealthful or unsanitary, or a threat to the public
health, safety, or welfare, in violation of a building code or ordinance
adopted under R.C. §731.231. Any building or structure appropriated pursuant to
this division which is not rehabilitated within two years shall be demolished.
      (2)   If, during the rehabilitation process, the municipality retains
title to the building or structure and the real property of which it is a part,
then within 180 days after the rehabilitation is complete, the municipality
shall appraise the rehabilitated building or structure and the real property of
which it is a part, and shall sell the building or structure and property at
public auction. The municipality shall advertise the public auction in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once a week for three
consecutive weeks, or as provided in R.C. § 7.16, prior to the date of sale.
The municipality shall sell the building or structure and real property to the

§ 94.22 DUTY AND AUTHORITY OF VILLAGE ADMINISTRATOR; SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   It shall be the responsibility of the Village Administrator to
administer, oversee, and superintend the sidewalk program of the village, to
include the issuance of permits, the inspection of sidewalks, the supervision
of repairs to and maintenance of sidewalks, and establishing specifications for
the construction and location of new sidewalks.
   (B)   Any sidewalk that is repaired must be the same size as the former
sidewalk's width and length unless it is less than three feet or more than five
feet. Depth of the sidewalk shall be at least four inches. The grade of the
sidewalk shall conform as closely as possible to the existing adjacent ground
elevations and shall be established in a manner that will not interfere with
the surface drainage from adjacent areas.
   (C)   The Village Administrator or his or her designee shall check the
grades and placement of forms prior to the placing of the concrete. No repaired
sidewalk should be lower than the previous sidewalk. The sidewalks should be
even with the adjoining property sidewalks or curbs. No sidewalks shall be less
than three feet wide or more than five feet wide unless in the business
district or with the approval of the Planning Commission in a new development.
   (D)   Sidewalks replaced or repaired are to be of the same uniform material.
Concrete will be the only material allowed to be used for repair or
replacement. If an existing sidewalk is of concrete material and only parts of
such sidewalk are being repaired, then concrete must be used. The existing
sidewalk removal limit shall be at an existing joint. If necessary to provide a
neat joint, the existing sidewalk shall be sawed or otherwise cut at the
removal joint.
   (E)   (1)   Upon written application to the Village Administrator, owners
may request a variance from the specifications herein as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the specifications would result in unnecessary hardship. Upon
written appeal to the Village Administrator, owners may request an
administrative hearing to determine if there has been an error concerning the
interpretation or administration of the enforcement of the specifications. The
application for variance or appeal must be submitted within 20 days of the
notice to repair or construct. Upon receipt of the application for variance or
appeal, the Village Administrator shall provide written notice to the owner of
the administrative hearing.
      (2)   Applications for variances or appeal shall be heard by the Street
and Sidewalk Committee of Village Council, at the next regularly scheduled
Street and Sidewalk Committee Meeting, after receipt of the completed
application. The Committee shall grant a variance if it finds that the literal
enforcement of the specifications would result in peculiar and exceptional
difficulties or undue hardship to the property owner. A variance from the
specifications shall not be authorized by the Committee unless it finds that
all the following facts and conditions exist:
         (a)   That unnecessary hardship would result from the literal
enforcement of the provisions of the specifications. Alleged hardships, such as
theoretical loss or limited possibilities of economic advantage, shall not be
considered real hardships. A hardship based on conditions created by the owner
shall not be considered a sufficient hardship for the granting of a variance.
It must be demonstrated that peculiar and special hardships exist which apply
only to the property in question and are separate and distinct from the general
conditions pertaining throughout the village.
         (b)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions
applying to the property in question such as traffic use and exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions.
         (c)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the sidewalks, curbs or gutters on the property can be
repaired or constructed pursuant to the specifications.
         (d)   That the granting of such variance or appeal will not be
contrary to the public interest, health or safety or the intent and purpose of
the specifications.
         (e)   That said variance or appeal, if granted, is the minimum
modification that will make possible the reasonable repair or construction of
the sidewalks, curbs or gutters.
      (3)   An application fee of $100 shall accompany the application for a
variance or appeal. Should the regularly scheduled hearing on the application
or appeal be continued by request of the applicant, an additional fee shall be
charged to applicant for each continuance.

and factors, singly or in combination, including cracks, unevenness, water
pocketing, stumbling blocks, and slipperiness.

§ 95.01 IMPOUNDING MOTOR VEHICLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of any person
adversely affected, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left
on private residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property. The Sheriff or Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or
place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an
abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of
storage for a longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor
vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the Sheriff or Chief of Police
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (A)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (B) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (D) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY means private
property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase
does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (C)   (1)   The Sheriff or Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor
vehicles that the chief orders into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this
section. The record shall include an entry for each such motor vehicle that
identifies the motor vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the
location from which it was removed, the date and time of its removal, the
telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the address
of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The
Sheriff or Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that
pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or
pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the
motor vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Sheriff’s or Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor
vehicle under division (A)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the
law enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person
who identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         (a)   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         (b)   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(D)(1)(b) of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (A)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         (a)   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         (b)   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (A)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (E)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other

   (G)   Whoever violates division (E) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (H)   Private tow-away zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in

division (H) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that
complies with all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow- away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a

established as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of
this section, without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the
private property may cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The

subject to division (H)(3) of this section, may recover the vehicle in
accordance with division (H)(7) of this section.
         (b)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (H)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         (c)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (H)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.

if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility
licensed under the authority of R.C. §§ 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise
regulated under authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on
which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by
any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the
possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a
bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's
vehicle.
   (B)   The municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or keeping,
or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any collector's
vehicle on private property with the permission of the person having the right

structure, or shall be removed from the property.
   (D)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the

days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (C)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         (a)   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public
servant at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter;
         (b)   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         (a)   The phrase OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN
OFFICE OF A PUBLIC SERVANT includes, but is not limited to, a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)
or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2)(a).
         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 of the Revised
Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the
offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section
may be commenced within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed
or five years after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (I)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a with a developmental disability or
physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until either
of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental
state that is an element of a criminal offense. Voluntary intoxication does not
relieve a person of a duty to act if failure to act constitutes a criminal
offense. Evidence that a person was voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible
to show whether or not the person was physically capable of performing the act
with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in §
130.08.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in §
130.09, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   (1)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit
an offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

Penalty, see § 130.99
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
   Solid and hazardous wastes generally, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.11.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
Penalty, see § 130.99
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused's residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person's residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person's use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person's residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution's burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and "proof beyond a reasonable
doubt", contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   "Reasonable doubt" is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self-defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person's use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person's person or under the person's control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.

§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality.
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality.
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality.
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality.
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunica-tion, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other tele-communication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.

municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this

   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.

2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
130.99 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 through 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) through (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution
when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When
consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are
imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;

         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.

   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term of up to 60 days in a community alternative sentencing center
or district community alternative sentencing center established and operated in
accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section,
with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully
complete the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.    Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.A. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.B.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;

complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits against more than one victim that involves a
common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of the offenses may
be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission
of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies
to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. § 2913.02,

(1) or (3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at

division (C) of this section is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
state law.

sentence, penalty or sanction imposed upon the offender pursuant to division

rationale utilized by the Board regarding the reason for disapproval. The Board
of Architectural Review shall offer to undertake continuing and meaningful
discussions with the applicant over a period of at least 30 days, but not to
exceed six months, from the date of disapproval, during which time the Board
shall offer to undertake continued and meaningful discussions with the owner of
the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both.
   (D)   The Board of Architectural Review shall decide all applications for
architectural review not later than 30 days after the hearing thereon, unless
an extension of time is agreed to by the applicant.
   (E)   Receiving a certificate of appropriateness does not negate
requirements to adhere to all other zoning and building regulations of the
village, county and/or state. When a certificate of appropriateness is issued
for demolition, the applicant shall receive further written instruction that
new in-fill construction in the district is subject to review by the Board of
Architectural Review.

§ 150.06 PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY UPON DEMOLITION OF A STRUCTURE.
   (A)   Whenever a structure within the District is proposed to be demolished,
an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be field with the
Secretary of the Board of Architectural Review as provided in this chapter. In
considering such application, the Board of Architectural Review shall first
determine if the structure is an identified Historic Resource or a structure
that has the potential for future designation as a Historic Resource or whether
demolition of the structure will have a negative affect on the historic and
architectural integrity or character of the District.
      (1)   Upon a determination the structure has no historic or architectural
significance and will not have a negative affect on the historic and
architectural integrity or character of district, the Board shall limit its
inquiry to the proposal for grading, landscaping, and other design treatment of
the property once the structure has been removed. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed to prevent the demolition of this type of a structure, whether
public or private, within the District.
      (2)   When an application is for demolition of a historically and
architecturally significant structure, in order for a request for demolition to
be approved, sufficient evidence from the applicant must be analyzed to enable
the Board to determine that the structure for which demolition is sought meets
one or more of the following conditions:
         (a)   The structure does not contribute to maintaining the character
of the "District;" or
         (b)   There is no reasonable economic use or return for the structure
in relation to the following: the amount paid for the property, net income over
the last five years, real estate taxes and assessed value of the property,
appraisals of the property undertaken with the purchase, financing, or
ownership of the property, inability of real estate brokers to sell or lease
the property at a reasonable price or rent, and inability to secure economic
incentives and/or funding available through federal, state, village, or private
programs; or
         (c)   Deterioration has progressed to the extent that rehabilitation
is not economically sound; or
         (d)   There is no feasible and prudent alternative to demolition
because alternative uses cannot earn a reasonable economic return in relation
to the following: a comparison between estimated post-construction market value
of the building and the cost of proposed redevelopment, alteration, demolition,
or removal and the additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the
recommendations of the Board of Architectural Review; or the lack of structural
soundness of the property.
      (3)   When an application is for demolition of a historically and
architecturally significant structure is denied, the Board of Architectural
Review shall undertake meaningful discussion with the applicant and offer to
investigate the feasibility of all means of preserving the listed property,
including purchase by a third party.
         (a)   If a compromise proposal is accepted by both the applicant and
the Board of Architectural Review, or if the Board determines that preservation
of a structure proposed for demolition is not feasible, the Board may
henceforth reverse its decision and issue a certificate of appropriateness.
         (b)   If the Board of Architectural Review and applicant cannot agree
on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then the Board
shall continue to schedule good faith meetings at least every 45 days after the
initial meeting.
         (c)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at
the time specified, then discussions may terminate. Upon termination for any
reason, the Board shall inform the applicant in writing of the termination of
such good faith discussions and that the Final Order for denial of the
application shall stand.
         (d)   If, after holding such good faith meeting(s) over the continued
discussion period specified by the Board of Architectural Review, no
alternative property use is developed or no offer to preserve the structure or
architecturally significant features is made by the applicant, the Village, or
a third party, then the Board may also consider whether failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and whether such Certificate may be issued without substantial
detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the
purposes of this Ordinance. In such event, the Board may approve the
application, with or without modifications, and the Secretary of the Board
shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed construction,
reconstruction, or alteration.
   (B)   Any proposed new construction in the Architectural District shall be
evocative of the general architectural styles, historic character, and
architectural integrity of Historic Resources in the Architectural District.
(Ord. 19-96, passed 10-7-96; Am. Ord. 06-2006, passed 5-1-06)
§ 150.07 REPAIR OR MAINTENANCE EXCEPTION.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent any ordinary repair or
maintenance of an exterior architectural feature or any ordinary planting and
landscaping now in the District.
(Ord. 19-96, passed 10-7-96; Am. Ord. 06-2006, passed 5-1-06)
§ 150.08 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person, firm or corporation, or any officer, department, board, or
agency of the village aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Architectural
Review involving an application for architectural review may appeal such
decision to the Oak Harbor Planning Commission by filing a notice of appeal to
the Planning Commission with the Secretary of the Architectural Review Board
within ten days from the date of decision, setting forth the facts of the case.
   (B)   The Secretary of the Board of Architectural Review shall then forward
the record of the proceeding before the Board of Architectural Review to the
Planning Commission who shall then hold a public hearing on the appeal.
   (C)   Such appeal shall be heard and decided within 30 days of receipt of
notice of appeal. The Planning Commission shall utilize the written findings of
the Board of Architectural Review to review economic, historic, architectural,
and aesthetic features of the subject structure, the nature and character of
the surrounding area, the use of such structure, and its cultural importance to
the Municipality. A majority vote of the Planning Commission shall be required
to overturn a decision of the Board.
   (D)   Decisions by the Planning Commission shall be deemed final
administrative orders for appellate purposes and any aggrieved person may file
in the County Court of Common Pleas in accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (E)   During the pendency of a timely filed appeal before the Planning
Commission for a decision of the Board of Architectural Review, or during the
appeal time prescribed in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506 for a decision of the Planning
Commission, no Certificate of Appropriateness, Zoning Permit, Building Permit,
or other permit necessary for the activity applied for shall be issued, or if
issued, shall be valid.

§ 150.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Remedies. In the event any building, structure landscaping, plantings,
fence or other exterior visible alteration or change is erected, installed,
constructed, reconstructed, altered, maintained, or removed contrary to and in
violation of the provisions of this chapter or any application granted by the
Board of Architectural Review, then, in addition to or in lieu of the action as
provided by this chapter, the Village Council, or its agent, any other proper
authority of the village, or any aggrieved person may institute an action for
an injunction, mandamus, or other legal proceeding to prevent such violation,
and to abate any illegal condition, or to cause the removal of any illegal
changes or alterations by appropriate legal means.
   (B)   Penalties. It shall be unlawful to locate, construct, reconstruct,
enlarge, change, or maintain any building or land in violation of §§
150.01 through
150.09. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any regulation thereto shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined
as provided in §
10.99. Every day during which such illegal location, erection, construction,
reconstruction, enlargement, change, or maintenance continues may be deemed a
separate offense.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Oak Harbor, State of Ohio, does ordain as the following.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Oak Harbor has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Oak Harbor as identified in §
151.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Oak Harbor.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Ottawa County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
and Flood    Insurance Rate Map, Ottawa County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
both effective December 1, 2022.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered
professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved by the
Village of Oak Harbor as required by §
151.47, Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
   (B)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Office of the Village Administrator, 146
Church Street, Oak Harbor, Ohio.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Oak Harbor, any
officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   APPEAL. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual
flood or 100 year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade elevation plus the depth
number (from one to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See LOWEST FLOOR.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow
on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA  amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 4781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-0l(K),
any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. MANUFACTURED HOME PARK does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by Oak Harbor
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For the purposes

   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance
studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, or A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial

occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals  or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
151.60 through
151.65, Appeals and Variances.
   (D)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.

preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably be utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (B)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         (a)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         (b)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of §
151.53(B) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (C)   Zones B, C, and X:
      (1)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM which

§ 151.53 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
151.30(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Village Administrator of Village of Oak
Harbor and the chief executive officer of any other communities impacted by the
proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Division (A)(2), items (a) and (c) through (e) of this section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Oak Harbor specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
151.30(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the

Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.63 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location if the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee as set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Oak Harbor
Planning Commission.
   (B)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 40 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Public hearing. 
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (C)(1)(a) to (k) of
this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 7-2022, passed 10-3-22)
§ 151.64 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (A)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
§ 152.055 GENERAL STATEMENT OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   The regulations in this subchapter shall control the manner in which
streets, lots, and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land.
These design controls shall help insure convenience and safe streets, the
creation of usable lots, the provision of space for public utilities, and the
reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and
functional neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features
of unplanned, haphazard growth.
   (B)   The Planning Commission and appropriate village officials have the
responsibility for reviewing the design of each future subdivision early in its
design development. The Planning Commission shall insure that all of the
requirements of this subchapter are met.
(Ord. 12-94, § 400, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.056 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangement, character, and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the Major Thoroughfare
Plan. Thoroughfares not contained in such plan shall conform to the
recommendation of the Planning Commission and the Village Engineer based upon
the design standards set forth in the Public Works Improvements Design Manual
and §§
152.057 through
152.067, inclusive. In addition, the final plat shall conform to the village
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 12-94, § 401, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.057 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, poor drainage,
topography, soils, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal, transportation
facilities, and other such conditions which may endanger health, life, or
property, and, if from investigations conducted by the public agencies
concerned it is determined that, in the best interest of the public, the land
should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning Commission shall
not approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced by
the subdivider for solving the problems that will be created by the development
of the land.
(Ord. 12-94, § 402, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.058 STREET DESIGN GENERALLY.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction, and location
of all streets shall conform to the Major Thoroughfare Plan and the Public
Works Improvements Design Manual. All streets shall be considered in their
relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, public
convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets. The circulation pattern shall discourage through traffic in the
interior of a subdivision. The subdivider shall provide, within the boundaries
of the subdivision plat, the necessary right-of-way for the widening,
continuance, or alignment of such streets in conformity with the Major
Thoroughfare Plan. The Planning Commission reserves the right to disapprove any
street plan which does not represent good design or does not insure continuity
of existing street systems.
(Ord. 12-94, § 403, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.059 STREET DESIGN STANDARDS FOR CUL-DE-SACS.
   The maximum length of a street with a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet. The
terminal right-of-way shall be a circular area with a minimum radius of 50 feet
measured from a point on the street centerline.
(Ord. 12-94, § 404, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.060 RIGHTS-OF-WAY FOR ALL STREETS.
   The rights-of-way for thoroughfares shall be in accordance with the Major
Thoroughfare Plan, and the minimum requirements shall be as follows:
Street Type   Right-of-Way Width
   (Feet) 
Arterial Street   80
Limited Access Highway   300
Local Collector Street   60
Primary Route   120
Residential Street   60
Secondary Route   100
Special Streets:
   Cul-de-sac   50 (radius)
   Marginal Access Street   50-60
(Ord. 12-94, § 405, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.061 HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT.

centerline curvature:
   Primary and Secondary Routes   300 feet
   Arterial and Collector Streets   200 feet
   Residential Streets   100 feet
   (B)   A minimum tangent of at least 100 feet shall be provided between
reversed curves on all residential streets; greater tangential lengths shall be
required on collector and arterial streets and other higher order
thoroughfares.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may modify such minimum standards in the
following situations:
      (1)   When a collector or residential street's lines deflect from each
other at any point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve
with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 200 feet or
with such greater radius as the Planning Commission may deem necessary for the
particular situation.
      (2)   For arterial streets, curves with radii adequate to insure longer
sight distances may be required by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   In subdivisions where the street pattern is curvilinear, curves
shall have radii acceptable to the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 12-94, § 406, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.062 VERTICAL ALIGNMENT.
   Vertical street profiles shall conform to the grades listed below.
   (A)   Arterial streets: maximum grade - 4%.

   (D)   Rate of grade change: maximum grade - 4%
   (E)   Minimum grade (normally only with curbs and gutters) - 0.1%
(Ord. 12-94, § 407, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.063 INTERSECTION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles
as topography or other limiting factors will permit. No intersection of streets
at angles less than 60 degrees shall be approved unless justified by extreme
topographical conditions. In such a case, special provisions as deemed
necessary by the Planning Commission shall be made in designing the
intersection to afford a satisfactory sight distance of approaching vehicles
from each intersecting street.
   (B)   Residential street intersections shall be rounded with a 25 foot
radius measured at the back of curbs, if such intersections occur at right
angles. Under the same condition and measured similarly, all other
intersections shall be rounded with a radius deemed appropriate by the Planning
Commission. If an intersection at an angle less than 60 degrees is unavoidable,
the radius of curvature shall be such as to allow vehicles, especially trucks
and buses, to make right turns and proceed in the proper lane without
encroaching upon the high speed lane of a multi-lane thoroughfare or across the
centerline of a two-lane thoroughfare.
   (C)   Streets jogs at intersections with centerline offsets shall be
avoided. Points of access to a primary or secondary route shall be spaced at a
minimum of 800 feet.
(Ord. 12-94, § 408, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.064 SPECIAL STREET TYPES.
   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   (A)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end
streets shall be permitted only as a segment of a continuing street plan
subject to extension into undeveloped acreage. Temporary dead-end streets shall
extend to the boundary of such undeveloped acreage and shall be provided with
an interim turnaround satisfactory to the Planning Commission in design. The
Planning Commission shall reserve the right to limit the length of such a dead-
end street based on principles of proper planning, and the Planning Commission
may require a street to extend to the boundary between a proposed subdivision
and the undeveloped acreage to provide for future development.
   (B)   The dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. If a parcel
to be subdivided exists adjacent to a dedicated or platted and recorded half-
width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley falling
within the proposed subdivision shall be platted, providing that in the opinion
of the Planning Commission such right-of-way is necessary for the proper
development of the area.
   (C)   Where subdivision lots would require direct vehicular access onto an
existing or proposed primary or secondary route as specified in the Major
Thoroughfare Plan, a marginal access street shall be designed. A planting strip
of a minimum width of 20 feet shall be provided between the primary or
secondary route and the marginal access street.
   (D)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains the right-of-way of a
railroad or an expressway, the Planning Commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance
which will permit appropriate use of the land situated between such right-of-
way and the required parallel streets. Such distance shall also be determined
with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations. In addition, the Planning Commission may also require the
provision of buffer planting strips, the platting of loop streets or cul-de-
sacs connected to such parallel streets, or any combination of such.
   (E)   Easements or reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be
prohibited except where deemed necessary by the Planning Commission and where
their control is definitely placed with the village.
   (F)   In subdividing land along existing streets or roads and within a
proposed subdivision, provisions for the dedication of land for one or more
streets to undeveloped land not fronting on an existing street or road shall be
incorporated. Such access streets shall be spaced not less than 800 feet nor
more than 1,400 feet apart.
   (G)   Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions except where
justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be approved in commercial and
industrial subdivisions if no other provisions can be made for adequate service
access. The minimum widths for alleys shall be 20 feet. Alley intersections,
sharp changes in alignment, and dead-ends shall not be permitted unless extreme
conditions would warrant such permission.
(Ord. 12-94, § 409, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.065 STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Streets in commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be so planned as to
minimize conflict between vehicular and pedestrian movement. Such streets shall
connect with arterial streets so as to not generate excess traffic on
residential streets. The Planning Commission may require marginal access
streets in such subdivisions to provide maximum safety and convenience.
(Ord. 12-94, § 410, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.066 STREET VACATION.
   The Planning Commission shall not recommend to Village Council the vacation
of any street dedicated to and accepted by the public if such vacation will
adversely affect the proper functioning of the existing street system or any
future street plans prepared by, or approved by, the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 12-94, § 411, passed 1-17-95)
Cross-reference:
   Vacating streets and alleys, see
T.S.O. VII
§ 152.067 NAMES OF STREETS.
   Names of streets shall not duplicate nor be confusingly similar to the name
of any other street in the village and the county. New streets which are
extensions of or in alignment with existing streets shall bear the name of the
existing streets.
(Ord. 12-94, § 412, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.068 BLOCKS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of blocks:
   (A)   The arrangement of blocks shall conform to the street design criteria
set forth in §§
152.058 through 152.067, inclusive.
   (B)   Blocks shall be arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the
size and character required by the village Zoning Code, to provide for adequate
community facilities and to regard the limitations and opportunities of
topography.
   (C)   Irregularly-shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs and loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds may be approved by
the Planning Commission if properly designed and located.
   (D)   No block shall be longer than 1,400 feet nor less than 600 feet. The
block shall normally accommodate two tiers of lots and shall have a minimum
width of 250 feet, except where unusual topography or other extreme physical
circumstances exist.
   (E)   Where blocks are more than 900 feet in length, a crosswalk easement
not less than ten feet in width at or near the halfway point of the block may
be required.
   (F)   Blocks intended for commercial and industrial subdivisions shall be
designed specifically for such purposes and shall include adequate provisions
for parking, loading, and delivery services. Such blocks shall not be less than
250 feet in width nor less than 1,000 feet in length.
(Ord. 12-94, § 413, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.069 LOTS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots:
   (A)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding development.
   (B)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of the village
Zoning Code.
   (C)   Each lot shall front on, be contiguous to, or border on a public
street.
   (D)   All side lot lines should be straight lines and should be at right
angles to street lines or radial on curved street lines except where the
Planning Commission determines that a variation would benefit the public
interest.
   (E)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the Planning
Commission determines that it is essential to overcome specific topographical
disadvantages and orientation and location problem due to existing street.
   (F)   No corner lot shall have a width, measured at the required front
setback line, of less than 75 feet.
   (G)   Lots fronting on a street upon which no other lots face should be
avoided. No rear lot line should border adjacent side lot lines. Where the rear
lot lines of a subdivision border a thoroughfare, the Planning Commission may
require a screen planting contained in a nonaccess easement or reservation
along such road.
   (H)   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than five times its
average width, nor shall the depth of any lot be less than 120 feet measured
from the edge of the road right-of-way.
(Ord. 12-94, § 414, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.070 EASEMENTS.
   All easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet. Where utilities are located
outside street right-of-way lines, easements at least 20 feet in width centered
along rear or side lot lines shall be provided. All easements locations shall
be approved by the utility company or the agency involved and, where necessary,
easements of greater width may be required by the Planning Commission.
Easements shall also be provided along every water course, storm sewer, or
drainage channel within a subdivision as provided in §
152.071.
(Ord. 12-94, § 415, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.071 STORM DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The preferred runoff pattern shall be towards the street. The design
of streets and grading shall be such that runoff from roofs, driveways, and
other impervious surfaces will be collected in ditches or gutters in short runs
300 feet to 400 feet in length. The runoff shall then be diverted from the
surface into storm sewers or a natural water course. Streets shall be located
away from water courses unless storm sewers are to be installed.
   (B)   Adequate measures for the protection of open and closed drainage
channels shall be provided.
   (C)   Property lines shall be so designed as to follow drainage easements,
except that such easements may cross lots larger than one acre.
   (D)   No water course shall be altered in such a way as to change the amount
or direction of flow. No fill, building, nor structures shall be situated in
natural water courses unless provision is made for the flow of water in a
manner satisfactory to the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 12-94, § 416, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.072 PUBLIC SITES, OPEN SPACE, AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   (A)   Where a park, playground, school, public access to water frontage, or
other public uses, which are contained within the Comprehensive Plan are
located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission
may request the dedication of such area within the subdivision or that
provision be made for the acquisition of such area by the proper agency within
a period of two years or other mutually acceptable period.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may require up to 10% of a subdivision,
exclusive of streets, to be allocated for recreational purposes. Such
requirement shall depend upon the size of the proposed subdivision, the density
of population, the location of the subdivision in relation to existing public
open spaces, and other similar determining factors.
   (C)   Where a large scale subdivision is proposed, the Planning Commission
may require that consideration be given to sites for schools, parks,
playgrounds, and other such areas for common use and that provisions be made
for such reservation or acquisition by the proper agency.
   (D)   The Planning Commission reserves the right to deny approval to a
subdivision if such a subdivision disregards the preservation of natural
features which add value to residential development and the community, such as
wooded areas, water courses, beaches, areas of natural or historical
significance, and similar irreplaceable assets as determined by the appropriate
federal, state, and county agencies.
(Ord. 12-94, § 417, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.073 SOIL EROSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   In the development of a subdivision, the developer shall not create a
situation where the erosion of soil can impair a public or private surface
ditch, stream, or river, nor shall excessive amounts of sediment be deposited
onto an adjoining property. Adequate controls of erosion and sedimentation of
both a temporary and permanent nature shall be provided during all phases of
clearing, grading, and construction to conserve soil resources and to insure no
significant change in water quality.
   (B)   In the event that any developer shall intend to make changes in the
contour of the land to a degree that erosion and sedimentation may occur, the
developer shall submit an erosion and sedimentation plan for approval to the
Planning Commission. The Planning Commission will request review of the plan by
the Soil and Water Conservation District of the county. Failure to employ the
recommended practices is cause to restrain the developer from further work
until he or she complies with the recommendations and withholding of
performance bond payments for work completed.

   (B)   When required improvements are not completed, the subdivider shall
insure their completion with a performance guarantee acceptable to the Planning
Commission, the Village Council, and the appropriate official before the final
plat may be approved. All improvements shall be completed within a one year
period from the date of final plan approval. Otherwise the appropriate official
will take the necessary steps to complete or correct the improvements using the
performance guarantee.
   (C)   Extensions to the completion deadline may be granted by the
appropriate official, if necessary.
   (D)   Once the improvements have been completed, a one year period of time
must pass before the improvements will be accepted. A sufficient amount of

(Ord. 12-94, § 515, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.106 TYPES OF PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   To guarantee the construction or maintenance of required improvements prior
to the approval and recording of the final plat, the subdivider may be required
to provide a performance guarantee in one or a combination of the following
arrangements:
   (A)   Performance bond. The subdivider may post a bond executed by a surety
company equal to the estimated cost plus 10% of the required improvements. The
bond shall be in favor of the Village Council. The bond shall guarantee
construction of the improvements according to the plans and specifications
approved by the Planning Commission and the responsible public officials. The
term of the bond shall not exceed one year, except the Planning Commission may
grant an extension where due cause can be shown.
   (B)   Deposit. The subdivider may make a deposit with a responsible escrow
agent or with a trust company. The deposit shall be money or negotiable bonds
in an amount equal to the estimated cost plus 10% of the required improvements.
If a cash deposit is made, an agreement may be executed to provide payments to
the contractor or the subdivider from the deposit as the work progresses and is
approved by the responsible officials.
   (C)   Escrow agreements. Where escrow agreements for the proposed
improvements are proposed for the estimated cost of the improvements plus 10%,
they will constitute sufficient guarantee for the installation of required
improvements in lieu of other methods stated above. An escrow agreement form is
available from the appropriate agency involved and must be used.
   (D)   Failure of subdivider to complete improvements. In case the subdivider
shall fail to complete the required improvements work within such time period
as required by the conditions or guarantees as outlined above, the Planning
Commission and Village Council may proceed to have such work completed and
reimburse the village for the cost thereof by appropriating the cash deposit,
certified check, surety bond, or escrow account, or shall take the necessary
steps to require performance by the bonding company.
(Ord. 12-94, § 516, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.107 PROGRESSIVE INSTALLATION.
   After the preliminary plat of a proposed subdivision has been approved by
the Planning Commission, the subdivider may improve a part or the entire area
and submit a final plat for that improved portion to the Planning Commission
for approval. The subdivider may make the necessary arrangements for completion
of the improvements as provided in §§
152.105 and
152.106 and submit a final plat for that portion to the Planning Commission for
approval.
(Ord. 12-94, § 517, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.108 ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS FOR USE AND MAINTENANCE
BY PUBLIC.
   (A)   The subdivider shall properly construct and shall be responsible for
making repairs and alterations to provide that improvements are in good
condition at the time the subdivider requests their acceptance by the Village
Council.
   (B)   The acceptance of improvements for use and maintenance by the public
shall be subject to satisfactory compliances with the following requirements:
      (1)   Inspection and approval of all improvements by the responsible
officials, with notification by those agencies to the Planning Commission and
Village Council in writing when the construction of the improvements has been
satisfactorily completed.
      (2)   When the required improvement construction is completed and all
required written approvals regarding same have been granted and received by the
Planning Commission and Village Council, the subdivider shall place a
certificate on the final plat indicating the acceptance by Village Council of
the improvement (including the improvements constructed therein) for use and
maintenance by the public.
      (3)   When the required improvement construction is not completed, or
written approvals of completed construction have not been received by the
Planning Commission and Village Council prior to submittal of the final plat
for approval, the Planning Commission shall, if it approves the plat, notify
Village Council when the construction of all required streets and other
required improvements in a specific plat has been satisfactorily completed,
giving a description of the improvement, and the Village Council shall
thereupon adopt a resolution or ordinance accepting such improvement (which
shall include the improvements constructed therein) for use and maintenance by
the public; however, such acceptance shall be dated one year from the date of
the resolution or ordinance and the subdivider shall keep such improvements in
a satisfactory state of maintenance, otherwise such acceptance shall be voided.
Where the improvement is to be publicly owned, transfer of the improvement, in
a manner acceptable to Village Council, shall occur.
(Ord. 12-94, § 518, passed 1-17-95)
FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS
§ 152.120 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purposes and intent of this subchapter are:
   (A)   To restrict or prohibit the subdivision of lands for uses which are
dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood or which, with
reasonably anticipated improvements, will cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities;
   (B)   To require that each subdivision lot in an area vulnerable to floods
be provided with a safe building site with adequate access and that public
facilities which serve such uses will be installed with protection against
flood damage at the time of construction; and
   (C)   To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision of
unprotected flood hazard lands, requiring that flood hazard areas be delineated
on all plats, and reserving through deed restrictions areas not suitable for
development.
(Ord. 12-94, § 600, passed 1-17-95)
Cross-reference:
   Flood damage prevention, see
Chapter 151
§ 152.121 FLOODPLAIN EVALUATION.
   (A)   The primary source of information that will be used by the Planning
Commission in determining the flood hazard potential of an area is the Floodway
and Flood Boundary Maps as amended. These maps were prepared by the Federal
Flood Insurance Administration for the village. Where necessary, other sources
of information may be used by the Planning Commission.
   (B)   A proposed subdivision will be located on the maps and its flooding
potential determined. Restrictions on the types of uses within a portion or the
entire proposed subdivision will be noted and must be followed. The Planning
Commission will meet with the subdivider to evaluate the degree and the extent
of the flood-prone areas within the proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 12-94, § 601, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.122 FLOODPLAIN REQUIREMENTS.
   In addition to the other stipulations set forth in these regulations, the
following shall be required of subdivisions within the delineated flood hazard
areas:
   (A)   The floodway and flood boundary areas shall be clearly labeled on both
the preliminary and final plat.
   (B)   Building site shall not be permitted in the floodway area. They may be
permitted in the flood boundary area if the sites are filled or if the first
habitable floor of the structure is elevated above the 100 year flood elevation
of the area. The 100 year flood elevation will be stated on both the
preliminary and final plats.
   (C)   Fill areas shall extend beyond the limits of the intended building
site and shall include areas for proper drainage and slope.
   (D)   The County Board of Health shall determine if adequate methods for
waste disposal and water supply can be accomplished for each building site.
where such systems will not function properly, the Planning Commission will not
approve the subdivision.
   (E)   The Village Engineer shall determine the street elevations in flood
hazard areas and state what drainage systems will be required for the
subdivision.
(Ord. 12-94, § 602, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.123 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations shall be
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. These regulations do not imply
that areas outside the delineated flood hazard areas or land uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the village or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 12-94, § 603, passed 1-17-95)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 152.140 ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY.
   These regulations shall be administered by the Planning Commission as
authorized by R.C. Chapter 711.
(Ord. 12-94, § 102, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.141 ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.
   (A)   Purpose. A proposed subdivision of land is subject to these
regulations where such division is along an existing street, does not involve
the opening, widening or extension of any street or road, and which involves no
more than five lots (four lots and the original parcel remaining) after the
original tract has been completely subdivided. Such a subdivision may be
submitted to the Village Administrator for approval without the requirement of
a record plat. If the Chairperson of the Planning Commission, the Zoning
Inspector, and the Village Administrator are satisfied that such proposed
subdivision of land is not contrary to applicable subdivision and zoning
regulations, the Village Administrator, the Zoning Inspector, and the Planning
Commission Chairperson shall, within seven working days after submission,
approve such proposed subdivision.
   (B)   Format. The owner of such land to be subdivided without a record plat
shall submit an official request in triplicate upon such forms as prescribed by
the Planning Commission. The application shall be filed with the Village
Administrator. Such application shall be accompanied by sufficiently accurate
drawings of the entire parcel and a legal description of the proposed parcel to
be transferred including any previously subdivided lots approved for recording
or recorded by the owner. Existing buildings shall be shown on the drawings. A
fee, as determined by the Village Council, shall accompany the application.
   (C)   Setback. The setback lines shall be required and shown on the drawings
submitted for review and approval.
   (D)   Approval. The Village Administrator upon receipt of an acceptable
application shall consider such application filed. Within seven working days of
such filing, the Village Administrator, the Zoning Inspector, and the Planning
Commission Chairperson shall approve or disapprove the subdivision
(administrative approval). Approval shall be made only if applicable drainage,
zoning, subdivision, and health requirements are met. Disapproval and the
reasons therefore shall be made on the records of the Planning Commission.
   (E)   Appeal by applicant. An applicant who has been denied approval may
within 30 days file an appeal with the Planning Commission. Within 30 days of
the appeal filing, the Planning Commission shall review the action and approve
or disapprove the decision of the Village Administrator, the Zoning Inspector,
and the Planning Commission Chairperson.
   (F)   Signatures. Upon any approval of subdivision under these provisions,
the Village Administrator, the Zoning Inspector, and the Planning Commission
Chairperson shall stamp in such manner as to clearly indicate their approval
and affix the signature of the agent responsible on conveyance of such parcel
or parcels.
   (G)   Administrative approval form. See Appendix § 5
(Ord. 12-94, §§ 200 — 205, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.142 RECORDING OF PLAT.
   No plat of any subdivision shall be recorded by the County Recorder or have
any validity until such plat has received a final approval in the manner
prescribed in these regulations.
(Ord. 12-94, § 800, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.143 REVISION OF PLAT AFTER APPROVAL.
   No changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be made in any plat
of a subdivision after approval has been granted by the Planning Commission and
endorsed in writing on the plat, unless such plat is first resubmitted to the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 12-94, § 801, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.144 SALE OF LAND WITHIN SUBDIVISIONS.
   No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision
shall attempt to transfer any land within the subdivision before such plat has
been approved and recorded in the manner prescribed in these regulations. The
description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of
transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or transferring
shall not exempt the transaction from the provisions of these regulations.
(Ord. 12-94, § 802, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.145 VARIANCES.
   The following regulations shall govern the granting of variances:
   (A)   Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary and unnecessary
hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations, due to
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, it may vary the
regulations so as to relieve such hardship, provided such relief may be granted
without detriment to the public interest and without impairing the intent and
purpose of these regulations or the desirable development of the neighborhood
and community. Such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of these regulations, or the Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   In granting variances or modifications, the Planning Commission may
require such conditions as, in its judgment, will secure substantially the
objective of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.
   (C)   Any variance granted shall be entered in the minutes of the Planning
Commission setting forth the reasons which justify such variance.
   (D)   A fee, as determined by the Village Council, shall be paid to the
Planning Commission upon filing for a variance.
   (E)   The application for a subdivision variance is set forth in Appendix §
6
(Ord. 12-94, § 803, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.146 APPEAL.
   Any person who believes he or she has been aggrieved by these regulations or
the action of the Planning Commission has the rights of appeal as set forth in
R.C. Chapter 711 or any other applicable section of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 12-94, § 804, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.147 FEES.
   (A)   Fees shall be determined by Village Council. All fees shall be
submitted with the applications.
   (B)   The aforementioned fees shall be paid in legal tender or by check or
money order made payable to the “Village of Oak Harbor.” No final plat,
preliminary plat, administrative approval, or appeal for variance shall be
considered filed until such fees have been paid.
   (C)   Other agencies may require a fee to defray their costs of inspection
or other work.
(Ord. 12-94, § 805, passed 1-17-95)
§ 152.999 PENALTY.
   The following penalties shall apply to the violations of these regulations:
   (A)   Whoever violates any rule or regulation adopted by the village for the
purpose of setting standards and requiring and securing the construction of
improvements within a subdivision or fails to comply with any order pursuant
thereto is creating a public nuisance and the creation thereof may be enjoined
and the maintenance thereof may be abated by action at suit by the village or
any citizen thereof. Whoever violates these regulations shall forfeit and pay
not less than $10 nor more than $1,000. Such sum may be recovered with costs in
a civil action brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Ottawa County.
   (B)   A County Recorder who records a plat contrary to the provisions of
these regulations shall forfeit and pay not less than $100 nor more than $500,
to be recovered with costs in a civil action by the Village Solicitor in the
name and for the use of the village.
   (C)   Whoever, being the owner or agent of any land, transfers any lot,
parcel or tract of such land from or in accordance with a plat of a subdivision
before such plat has been recorded in the office of the County Recorder shall
forfeit and pay the sum of not less than $10 nor more than $500 for each lot,
parcel, or tract of land so sold. The description of such lot, parcel, or tract
by metes and bounds in the deed or transfer shall not serve to exempt the
seller from the forfeiture provided in this section. Such sum may be recovered
in a civil action, brought by the Village Solicitor, other corresponding
official, or the Planning Commission in the name of the village. The sale of
lots, parcels or tract from the plat of a subdivision where these areas are
indicated for the exclusive use of the abutting or other owners in such
subdivision and are not public streets, ways, or grounds shall not serve to
exempt the seller from the requirements of R.C. Chapter 711, as amended, or
from the forfeiture herein provided. 
   (D)   Any person who disposes of or offers for sale or lease for a time
exceeding five years any lot or any part of a lot in a subdivision before
provisions of these regulations are complied with shall forfeit and pay the sum
of not less than $10 nor more than $500 for each lot or part of a lot so sold,
offered for sale or leased, to be recovered with costs in a civil action in the
name of the Village Treasurer for the use of the village.

CLUSTER SUBDIVISION - REGULATIONS
FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES
§ 153.480 PURPOSE.
   The purposes of this subchapter is to permit a reduction in lot dimensions,
yards, building setbacks, and area requirements in order to achieve a more
useful pattern in open space and recreation areas accessible to the majority of
the living units, to achieve a more efficient use of land than is generally
derived through conventional development resulting in substantial savings
through shorter utilities and streets; to encourage a development pattern which
preserves and utilizes natural topography and geologic features, scenic vistas,
trees and other vegetation, and prevents the disruption of natural drainage
patterns.

§ 153.483 LOT SIZE VARIATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Generally. The lot size for cluster subdivision developments within
the R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-5 Residential Districts may be averaged or reduced
from those sizes required by the applicable zoning district within which such
development is located by compliance with the following procedures.
   (B)   Site acreage computation.
      (1)   The acreage proposed for a cluster subdivision development shall be
computed to determine the total land area available for development into lots
under the minimum lot size requirements of the applicable zoning district in
which the proposed cluster subdivision development is located.
      (2)   In arriving at a gross acreage figure, the following lands shall
not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the maximum number
of lots or dwelling units that may be created under the procedure: land use by
public utilities as easements for major facilities, such as electric
transmission lines, sewer lines, water mains, or other similar lands which are
not available to the owner because of such easements.
   (C)   Maximum number of lots and dwelling units. After the total gross area
available for development has been determined by the above procedure, the
maximum number of lots or dwelling units that may be approved within the
subdivision development shall be computed by subtracting from the total gross
area available, a fixed percentage of such total for street right-of-way
purposes, and dividing the remaining net area available by the minimum lot area
requirement of the zoning district in which the cluster subdivision development
is located.
      (1)   The fixed percentages of street right-of-way purposes to be
subtracted from the total gross area available for development shall be 20%.
This percentage shall apply regardless of the amount of land actually required
for street right-of-way.
      (2)   Under this procedure, individual lots may be reduced in area below
the minimum lot size required by the zoning district in which the cluster
subdivision development is located; provided, that the total number of dwelling
units or lots created within the development is not more than the maximum
number that would be allowed if the tract were developed under the minimum lot
area requirements of the applicable zone district in which it is located.
   (D)   Permissive minimum lot area. Notwithstanding other procedures set
forth in this subchapter, lot sizes within cluster subdivisions shall not be
varied or reduced in area below 30% of the lot size required in the zoned
district in which it is located. The lot width shall not be less than 55 feet.
   (E)   Minimum yard requirements. Under the lot averaging or reduction
procedure, each lot shall have at least the following minimum yards:
      (1)   Front yards - 25 feet from all dwellings.
      (2)   Side yards - 6 feet on each side.
      (3)   Rear yards - 25 feet for all dwellings.
      (4)   Building height - shall not exceed 35 feet and accessory buildings
shall not exceed a height of 15 feet.

§ 153.484 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   For each square foot of land gained through the averaging or reduction
of lot sizes under the provisions of this subchapter, equal amounts of land
shall be provided as open space. All open space, tree cover, recreational area,
scenic vista, or other authorized open land areas shall be either set aside as
common land for the sole benefit, use, and enjoyment of present and future lot
or homeowners within the development, or may be dedicated to the village as
park land for the use of the general public.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine which of these options is
most appropriate and select one of the following procedures as part of its
approval of a conditional use permit for a cluster subdivision development:
      (1)   That open space land shall be conveyed by proper legal procedures
from the tract owner or owners to a homeowners association or other similar
non-profit organizations so that fee simple title shall be vested in tract lot
owners as tenants in common; provided, that suitable arrangements have been
made for the maintenance of such land and any buildings thereon; and provided
further, an open space easement for such land may be conveyed to the village to
assure that open space land shall remain open.
      (2)   That open space land may be dedicated to the general public for
park or recreational purposes by the tract owner or owners; provided, that the
location and extent of such land conforms to the Future Land Use Plan for the
village; and provided further, that the access to and characteristics of such
land is such that it will be readily available to and desirable for public use,
development and maintenance. The owners or developers of the cluster
subdivision development shall not be compelled or required to improve the
natural condition of such open space lands before a conveyance to the village.

effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it
is not the intent nor effect of the requirements to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to
deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this requirement to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
materials.

partnership; the state or other jurisdiction under which it is organized; the
address of its principal office in Ohio; its federal identification number; the

the address of its principal office in Ohio; its federal identification number;

stockholder holding more than 2% of the applicant's stock. If any shareholder
is a corporation or a general or limited partnership, the same information
shall be included for such shareholder as is required for an applicant that is
a corporation or general or limited partnership.
      (3)   The application must contain the address where the sexually
oriented business is to be located and shall be accompanied by a sketch or
diagram showing the configuration of the premises, including a statement of
total floor space occupied by the business. The sketch or diagram need not be
professionally prepared, but must be drawn to a designated scale or drawn with

minus six inches.
      (4)   Applicants for a permit shall have a continuing duty to promptly

said information changes in any way from what is stated on the application. The
failure to comply with said continuing duty within 30 days from the date of
such change, by supplementing the application on file with the village, shall
be grounds for revocation or non-renewal of a permit.
   (B)   A decision of whether or not to issue a permit or license shall be
made within 21 days after receipt of all the information required under this
section.
   (C)   A permit or license issued under this section to a sexually oriented
business shall expire one year after the date of issuance. An application for a

(4) of this section shall be used to determine whether or not to renew a
permit. Each permit for a sexually oriented business shall contain the name of
the applicant, the address of the sexually oriented business and the expiration
date of the permit.
   (D)   In addition, adult oriented sexual businesses shall be subject to the
following requirements:
      (1)   Sexually oriented business uses shall be located at least 1,500
feet from any other adult entertainment uses.
      (2)   Sexually oriented business uses shall be located at least 500 feet

§ 153.570 GUIDELINES FOR GRANTING VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances may be granted by the Board where the strict application of
any provision of this Zoning Code would result in practical difficulties to the
property owner. A request for a variance may be made to the Zoning Board of
Appeals through the Zoning Administrator by an aggrieved property owner.
   (B)   A variance from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code
shall not be authorized by the Board unless it finds that the following factors
support the granting of the area variance:
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be a beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or adjoining properties suffer a "substantial detriment";
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the problem can be solved by some manner other than the
granting of a variance;
      (7)   Whether the variance preserves the "spirit and intent" of the
zoning requirement and whether "substantial justice" would be done by granting
the variance. Alleged hardships, such as theoretical loss or limited
possibilities of economic advantage, shall not be considered real hardships.
   (C)   Variations to nonconforming uses and buildings.
      (1)   The Board shall have no powers to authorize, as a variance, the
establishment of a nonconforming building or use, extensions of or changes in
nonconforming uses where none previously existed.
      (2)   The substitution of a nonconforming use existing at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Code for another nonconforming use shall be allowed;
provided, no structural alterations are made except those required by law or
ordinance.
